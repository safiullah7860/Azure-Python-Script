A mixed-methods feasibility study to assess the acceptability and applicability of immersive virtual reality sepsis game as an adjunct to nursing education,"Adhikari, R.; Kydonaki, C.; Lawrie, J.; O'Reilly, M.; Ballantyne, B.; Whitehorn, J.; Paterson, R.","BACKGROUND: Virtual Reality (VR) simulation has been a topic of interest in recent years as an innovative strategy for healthcare education. Although there are a handful of studies evaluating VR simulation on knowledge, motivation, and satisfaction; there is a paucity of evidence to evaluate the effectiveness, acceptability and usability of 'Immersive' VR (IVR) simulation in nursing students. OBJECTIVE(S): A two-stage sequential mixed-methods feasibility study underpinned by gaming theory investigated; (1) the impact of IVR sepsis game on pre-registration nurses' self-efficacy and, (2) their perceptions of the acceptability and applicability of IVR sepsis game as an adjunct to nursing simulation education. METHOD(S): The IVR simulation intervention was designed in collaboration with serious game specialists. Stage one collated pre and post-intervention self-efficacy scores with 19 pre-registration nurses using the validated instrument, Nursing Anxiety and Self-Confidence with Clinical Decision Making (NASC-CDM©) scale. Stage two used a descriptive qualitative approach to explore student nurses' perceptions of the game. RESULT(S): In stage one, pre and post-test scores revealed significant increase in self-confidence (26.1%, P < 0.001) and a significant decrease in anxiety (23.4%, P < 0.001). Stage two qualitative responses revealed four over-arching themes: acceptability, applicability, areas of improvement of IVR sepsis game and limitations of IVR game. CONCLUSION(S): IVR simulation show promise as an adjunct for nurse simulation and it appears to increase self-efficacy in pre-registration nursing students. Further testing with a sufficiently powered sample size will ratify findings and provide effective solutions to distance and online learning. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The relevance of low-fidelity virtual reality simulators compared with other learning methods in basic endovascular skills training,"Aeckersberg, G.; Gkremoutis, A.; Schmitz-Rixen, T.; Kaiser, E.","Objective: The use of simulators has shown a profound impact on the development of both training and assessment of endovascular skills. Furthermore, there is evidence that simulator training is of great benefit for novice trainees. However, there are only a few simulators available geared specifically toward novice learners. Whereas research suggests that low-fidelity simulators could fill this gap, there are insufficient data available to determine the role of low-fidelity simulators in the training of endovascular skills. Method(s): Medical students in their fifth year (N = 50) with no previous endovascular experience were randomized into three groups: conventional learning through a video podcast (group V; n = 12), low-fidelity simulation training with tablet-paired touch-gesture navigation (group A; n = 12), and low-fidelity simulation training with tablet-paired physical endovascular tool navigation (group S; n = 26). Within their respective groups, all students attended a 1-day class on basic endovascular skills. Questionnaire items for self-assessment before and after the class and assessment after the class of the participant's practical skills on a high-fidelity simulator were analyzed across all three groups as well as for each group separately using nonparametric tests. Result(s): All 50 participants completed the training. Participants in group S showed a significantly increased interest in working in interventional cardiology (P =.02) and vascular surgery (P =.03) after the class. Evaluation of the questionnaire items after the class showed that participants in group S rated their practical skills significantly higher after the class compared with those in group V and group A (P <.001 for pairwise comparison of all three groups, respectively), creating a significant trend across the three groups. However, analysis of the practical skills assessment for all three groups showed a significant difference between the groups only for choosing a guidewire (P =.045) and a significant trend in performance across the groups for choosing a guidewire and for positioning the guidewire in the vessel (P =.02 and P =.05, respectively). All other steps of the skills assessment showed no significant differences or a trend across the groups. Conclusion(s): Low-fidelity simulation training, particularly with physical endovascular tool navigation, led to increased motivation in novice trainees. Whereas simulator training was associated with increased confidence of trainees in their skills, assessment of their practical skills showed no actual improvement in this study. Overall, low-fidelity simulation has the potential to benefit novice trainees, but possible risks of simulation training should be further evaluated.

Performance of robotic simulated skills tasks is positively associated with clinical robotic surgical performance,"Aghazadeh, M. A.; Mercado, M. A.; Pan, M. M.; Miles, B. J.; Goh, A. C.","Objective: To compare user performance of four fundamental inanimate robotic skills tasks (FIRST) as well as eight da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS) virtual reality tasks with intra-operative performance (concurrent validity) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and to show that a positive correlation exists between simulation and intra-operative performance. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 21 urological surgeons with varying robotic experience were enrolled. Demographics were captured using a standardized questionnaire. User performance was assessed concurrently in simulated (FIRST exercises and dVSS tasks) and clinical environments (endopelvic dissection during RARP). Intra-operative robotic clinical performance was scored using the previously validated six-metric Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) tool. The relationship between simulator and clinical performance was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation. Result(s): Performance was assessed in 17 trainees and four expert robotic surgeons with a median (range) number of previous robotic cases (as primary surgeon) of 0 (0-55) and 117 (58-600), respectively (P = 0.001). Collectively, the overall FIRST (rho = 0.833, P < 0.001) and dVSS (rho = 0.805, P < 0.001) simulation scores correlated highly with GEARS performance score. Each individual FIRST and dVSS task score also demonstrated a significant correlation with intra-operative performance, with the exception of Energy Switcher 1 exercise (P = 0.063). Conclusion(s): This is the first study to show a significant relationship between simulated robotic performance and robotic clinical performance. Findings support implementation of these robotic training tools in a standardized robotic training curriculum.

dV-Trainer vs. da Vinci Simulator: Comparison of Virtual Reality Platforms for Robotic Surgery,"Ahmad, S. B.; Rice, M.; Chang, C.; Zureikat, A. H.; Zeh, H. J.; Hogg, M. E.","Background: A virtual reality (VR) curriculum performed on the da Vinci Simulation System (DVSS) was previously shown to be effective in training fellows. The dV-Trainer is a separate platform with similar features to the da Vinci console, but its efficacy and utility versus the DVSS simulator are not well known. Material(s) and Method(s): A mastery-based VR curriculum was completed by surgical fellows on the DVSS (2014-2016) and on the dV-Trainer (2016-2018) at a large academic center. Pre-test/post-test scores were used to evaluate performance between the two groups. Data was collected prospectively. Result(s): Forty-six fellows enrolled in the curriculum: surgical oncology (n=31), hepatobiliary (n=5), head/neck (n=4), endocrine (n=2), cardiothoracic (n=2), gynecology (n=1) and transplant surgery (n=1). Twenty-four used the DVSS and twenty-two used the dV-Trainer. Compared to the DVSS, the dV-Trainer was associated with lower scores on 2 of 3 VR modules in the pre-test (P=0.027, P<0.001, respectively) and post-test (P=0.021, P<0.001, respectively). Fellows in the dV-Trainer era scored lower on inanimate drills as well. Average VR curriculum score was lower on the dV-Trainer (71.3% vs 83.34%, P<0.001). dV-Trainer users spent more time completing the pre-test and post-test; however, overall simulator time to complete the curriculum was not significantly different (297 vs 231 minutes, P=0.142). Both groups showed improvement in scores after completion of the VR curriculum. Conclusion(s): The dV-Trainer simulator allows for more usability outside the operating room to complete VR modules; however, the DVSS simulator group outperformed the dV-Trainer group on the post-test.

Effectiveness of virtual reality training in orthopaedic surgery,"Aim, F.; Lonjon, G.; Hannouche, D.; Nizard, R.","Purpose The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) training in orthopaedic surgery. Methods A comprehensive systematic review was performed of articles of VR training in orthopaedic surgery published up to November 2014 from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. Results We included 10 relevant trials of 91 identified articles, which all reported on training in arthroscopic surgery (shoulder, n = 5; knee, n = 4; undefined, n = 1). A total of 303 participants were involved. Assessment after training was made on a simulator in 9 of the 10 studies, and in one study it took place in the operating room (OR) on a real patient. A total of 32 different outcomes were extracted; 29 of them were about skills assessment. None involved a patient-related outcome. One study focused on anatomic learning, and the other evaluated technical task performance before and after training on a VR simulator. Five studies established construct validity. Three studies reported a statistically significant improvement in technical skills after training on a VR simulator. Conclusions VR training leads to an improvement of technical skills in orthopaedic surgery. Before its widespread use, additional trials are needed to clarify the transfer of VR training to the OR.

The transferability of generic minimally invasive surgical skills: Is there crossover of core skills between laparoscopy and arthroscopy?,"Akhtar, K.; Sugand, K.; Wijendra, A.; Sarvesvaran, M.; Sperrin, M.; Standfield, N.; Cobb, J.; Gupte, C.","Objective The primary objective was observing transferability of minimally invasive surgical skills between virtual reality simulators for laparoscopy and arthroscopy. Secondary objectives were to assess face validity and acceptability. Design Prospective single-blinded crossover randomized controlled trial. Setting MSk Laboratory, Imperial College London. Participants Student doctors naive to simulation and minimally invasive techniques. Methods A total of 72 medical students were randomized into 4 groups (2 control groups and 2 training groups), and tested on haptic virtual reality simulators. Group 1 (control; n = 16) performed a partial laparoscopic cholecystectomy and Group 2 (control; n = 16) performed a diagnostic knee arthroscopy. Both groups then repeated the same task a week later. Group 3 (training; n = 20) completed a partial laparoscopic cholecystectomy, followed by an arthroscopic training program, and repeated the laparoscopic cholecystectomy a week later. Group 4 (training; n = 20) performed a diagnostic knee arthroscopy, followed by a laparoscopic training program, and then repeated the initial arthroscopic test a week later. The time taken, instrument path length, and speed were recorded for each participant and analyzed. Results Time taken for task: All 4 cohorts were significantly quicker on their second attempt but the 2 training groups outperformed the 2 control groups, with the laparoscopy-trained group improving the most (p < 0.05). Economy of movement: All cohorts had a significant improvement in left hand path length (p < 0.01) but there was no difference for right hand path length. Left hand speed: Only the 2 training groups showed significant improvement with the laparoscopy-trained group improving the most (p < 0.05). Right hand speed: All cohorts improved significantly with the laparoscopy-trained group improving the most (p < 0.05). Face validity and acceptability were established for both simulators. Conclusion This study showed that minimally invasive surgical skills learnt on a laparoscopy simulator are transferable to arthroscopy and vice versa, with greater effect after training on the laparoscopy simulator.

Validation of a virtual reality simulator for the use of transvaginal ultrasonography in gynaecology and early pregnancy,"Al-Memar, M.; Saso, S.; Bobdiwala, S.; Ameye, L.; Guha, S.; Joash, K.; Stalder, C.; Sur, S.; Moorthy, K.; Timmerman, D.; Bourne, T.","Introduction: The objective was to validate a virtual reality simulation ultrasound model as a tool for training in the use of transvaginal ultrasonography in gynaecology and early pregnancy. Method(s): Three separate groups consisting of novice and intermediate level residents as well as expert ultrasound examiners were recruited to the study. All were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding demographic data and ultrasound experience. They subsequently completed two modules: basic gynaecology and early pregnancy, followed by corresponding assessments using a high-fidelity simulator (Scantrainer; MedaphorTM, Cardiff, UK). Finally, the expert group completed an additional questionnaire about various elements of the simulator using a 5-point Likert scale. Result(s): Each group consisted of eight participants. Overall, the participants agreed that simulation played a role in training (Novices: 75% (n = 6); Intermediates: 100% (n = 8); Experts: 75% (n = 6)). For the degree of realism of the target objects in the gynaecology and early pregnancy module environments compared to a real-patient environment, the simulator was rated satisfactory or very satisfactory by 88% (n = 7) and 75% (n = 6) of experts, respectively. All experts rated the overall usefulness of the content of the simulator for learning fundamental ultrasound technical skills compared to current training methods to be at least satisfactory. When reviewing the assessment scores, experts scored higher than non-experts in gynaecology (P = 0.002) and early pregnancy modules (P = 0.03). Discussion(s): Face, content and construct validity were demonstrated by the virtual reality ultrasound simulator, suggesting it may be an effective method for training ultrasound skills in gynaecology and early pregnancy to non-expert residents.

Feedback and motor skill acquisition using a haptic dental simulator,"Al-Saud, L. M.; Mushtaq, F.; Allsop, M. J.; Culmer, P. C.; Mirghani, I.; Yates, E.; Keeling, A.; Mon-Williams, M. A.; Manogue, M.","AIM: To investigate the effect of qualitatively different types of pedagogical feedback (FB) on the training, transfer and retention of basic manual dexterity dental skills using a virtual reality (VR) haptic dental simulator. METHODS: Sixty-three participants (M = 22.7 years; SD = 3.4 years), with no previous dental training, were randomly allocated to one of three groups (n = 21 each). Group 1 received device-only feedback during the training phase, that is the visual display of the simulator (DFB); Group 2 received verbal feedback from a qualified dental instructor (IFB); and Group 3 received a combination of instructor and device feedback (IDFB). Participants completed four tasks during which feedback was given according to group allocation as well as two skills transfer tests. Skill retention was examined immediately after training, at 1 week and at 1 month post-test. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between the groups in overall performance (P < 0.001) and error (P = 0.006). Post hoc comparisons revealed the IDFB group produced substantially better performance and fewer errors in comparison with DFB and IFB training. This difference translated to improved performance in skill retention and generalisation of knowledge to novel tasks. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the acquisition and retention of basic dental motor skills in novice trainees is best optimised through a combination of instructor and visual display (VR)-driven feedback. The results have implications for the utility and implementation of VR haptic technology in dental education. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Drilling into the functional significance of stereopsis: the impact of stereoscopic information on surgical performance,"Al-Saud, L. M.; Mushtaq, F.; Mirghani, I.; Balkhoyor, A.; Keeling, A.; Manogue, M.; Mon-Williams, M. A.","PURPOSE: One suggested advantage of human binocular vision is the facilitation of sophisticated motor control behaviours via stereopsis - but little empirical evidence exists to support this suggestion. We examined the functional significance of stereopsis by exploring whether stereopsis is used to perform a highly skilled real-world motor task essential for the occupational practice of dentistry. METHODS: We used a high fidelity virtual reality simulator to study how dentists' performance is affected by the removal of horizontal retinal image disparities under direct and indirect (mirror) observation. Thirteen qualified dentists performed a total of four different dental tasks under non-stereoscopic and stereoscopic vision conditions, with two levels of task complexity (direct and indirect observation) using a virtual reality dental simulator. RESULTS: Depth related errors were significantly higher under non-stereoscopic viewing but lateral errors did not differ between conditions. Indirect observation led to participants drilling less of the target area compared to direct viewing, but this did not interact with the stereopsis manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm that dental practitioners use stereopsis and its presence results in improved dental performance. It remains to be determined whether individuals with stereo-deficits can compensate adequately. Nevertheless, these findings suggest an important role for stereopsis within at least one occupation and justify the design of simulators with 3D displays. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Virtual Simulation in Enhancing Procedural Training for Fluoroscopy-guided Lumbar Puncture: A Pilot Study,"Ali, S.; Qandeel, M.; Ramakrishna, R.; Yang, C. W.","Rationale and Objectives: Fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture (FGLP) is a basic procedural component of radiology residency and neuroradiology fellowship training. Performance of the procedure with limited experience is associated with increased patient discomfort as well as increased radiation dose, puncture attempts, and complication rate. Simulation in health care is a developing field that has potential for enhancing procedural training. We demonstrate the design and utility of a virtual reality simulator for performing FGLP. Material(s) and Method(s): An FGLP module was developed on an ImmersiveTouch platform, which digitally reproduces the procedural environment with a hologram-like projection. From computed tomography datasets of healthy adult spines, we constructed a 3-D model of the lumbar spine and overlying soft tissues. We assigned different physical characteristics to each tissue type, which the user can experience through haptic feedback while advancing a virtual spinal needle. Virtual fluoroscopy as well as 3-D images can be obtained for procedural planning and guidance. The number of puncture attempts, the distance to the target, the number of fluoroscopic shots, and the approximate radiation dose can be calculated. Preliminary data from users who participated in the simulation were obtained in a postsimulation survey. Result(s): All users found the simulation to be a realistic replication of the anatomy and procedure and would recommend to a colleague. On a scale of 1-5 (lowest to highest) rating the virtual simulator training overall, the mean score was 4.3 (range 3-5). Conclusion(s): We describe the design of a virtual reality simulator for performing FGLP and present the initial experience with this new technique.

Utilizing a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network to assess a virtual reality surgical procedure,"Alkadri, S.; Ledwos, N.; Mirchi, N.; Reich, A.; Yilmaz, R.; Driscoll, M.; Del Maestro, R. F.","Background: Virtual reality surgical simulators are a safe and efficient technology for the assessment and training of surgical skills. Simulators allow trainees to improve specific surgical techniques in risk-free environments. Recently, machine learning has been coupled to simulators to classify performance. However, most studies fail to extract meaningful observations behind the classifications and the impact of specific surgical metrics on the performance. One benefit from integrating machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks, to simulators is the ability to extract novel insights into the composites of the surgical performance that differentiate levels of expertise. Objective(s): This study aims to demonstrate the benefits of artificial neural network algorithms in assessing and analyzing virtual surgical performances. This study applies the algorithm on a virtual reality simulated annulus incision task during an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion scenario. Design(s): An artificial neural network algorithm was developed and integrated. Participants performed the simulated surgical procedure on the Sim-Ortho simulator. Data extracted from the annulus incision task were extracted to generate 157 surgical performance metrics that spanned three categories (motion, safety, and efficiency). Setting(s): Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Research Lab; Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Center, McGill University, Montreal, Canada. Participant(s): Twenty-three participants were recruited and divided into 3 groups: 11 post-residents, 5 senior and 7 junior residents. Result(s): An artificial neural network model was trained on nine selected surgical metrics, spanning all three categories and achieved 80% testing accuracy. Conclusion(s): This study outlines the benefits of integrating artificial neural networks to virtual reality surgical simulators in understanding composites of expertise performance.

VR-based training of craniotomy for intracranial aneurysm surgery,"Allgaier, M.; Amini, A.; Neyazi, B.; Sandalcioglu, I. E.; Preim, B.; Saalfeld, S.","Purpose: Intracranial aneurysms can be treated micro-surgically. This procedure involves an appropriate head position of the patient and a proper craniotomy. These steps enable a proper access, facilitating the subsequent steps. To train the access planning process, we propose a VR-based training system. Method(s): We designed and implemented an immersive VR access simulation, where the user is surrounded by a virtual operating room, including medical equipment and virtual staff. The patient's head can be positioned via hand rotation and an arbitrary craniotomy contour can be drawn. The chosen access can be evaluated by exposing the aneurysm using a microscopic view. Result(s): The evaluation of the simulation took place in three stages: testing the simulation using the think-aloud method, conducting a survey and examining the precision of drawing the contour. Although there are differences between the virtual interactions and their counterparts in reality, the participants liked the immersion and felt present in the operating room. The calculated surface dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance and feedback of the participants show that the difficulty of drawing the craniotomy is appropriate. Conclusion(s): The presented training simulation for head positioning and access planning benefits from the immersive environment. Thus, it is an appropriate training for novice neurosurgeons and medical students with the goal to improve anatomical understanding and to become aware of the importance of the right craniotomy hole.

Transfer of Flexible Ureteroscopic Stone-Extraction Skill from a Virtual Reality Simulator to the Operating Theatre: A Pilot Study,"Aloosh, M.; Noureldin, Y. A.; Andonian, S.","Aim: To assess the learning curve of flexible ureteroscopic stone extraction using the UroMentorTM simulator and transfer of flexible ureteroscopic stone extraction skills to the operating theatre. Material(s) and Method(s): After obtaining ethics approval, urology Post-Graduate Trainees (PGTs) from Post-Graduate Years (PGYs) 1 to 4 were recruited. During phase I, participants completed 3 weekly 1-hour training sessions on the UroMentor simulator practicing task 10, where two stones from the left proximal ureter and renal pelvis were extracted using a basket. Objective assessments by the simulator and subjective assessments using the validated Ureteroscopy-Global Rating Scale (URS-GRS) were used to establish the learning curve. During phase II, the URS-GRS tool was used to assess performance of participants in the operating theatre. URS-GRS scores obtained on the simulator and in the operating theatre were correlated. Result(s): In phase I, eight urology PGTs (PGY1-4) with mean age of 27.8 +/- 2 (25-31) years participated in the study. PGTs practiced a total of 52 times, with a mean operative time of 14.6 +/- 4.3 minutes and a mean fluoroscopy time of 10.4 +/- 12 seconds. Competency in task 10 was achieved after seven trials on the UroMentor simulator. In phase II, 5 PGTs were assessed during 55 consecutive flexible ureteroscopic stone extraction in the operating theatre. The mean operative time was 51.4 +/- 15.2 minutes and the mean fluoroscopy time was 29 +/- 6 seconds. There was a significant positive correlation between URS-GRS scores obtained on the simulator and in the operating theatre (r = 0.9, p = 0.03), thus establishing predictive validity of performance on the UroMentor simulator. Conclusion(s): Competency in task 10 on the UroMentor simulator (flexible ureteroscopic stone extraction) was achieved after seven trials. Since there was a strong positive correlation between URS-GRS scores on the simulator and in the operating theatre, the skills obtained on the simulator could be transferred to the operating theatre. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2016,October,Journal of Endourology,30(10),,1120-1125,612649581,,,#136,Aloosh 2016,William Bond (2023-02-26 11:15:53)(Screen): may be duplicate; ,
Face and content validity of the virtual reality simulator 'ScanTrainer',"Alsalamah, A.; Campo, R.; Tanos, V.; Grimbizis, G.; Van Belle, Y.; Hood, K.; Pugh, N.; Amso, N.","Background: Ultrasonography is a first-line imaging in the investigation of women's irregular bleeding and other gynaecological pathologies, e.g. ovarian cysts and early pregnancy problems. However, teaching ultrasound, especially transvaginal scanning, remains a challenge for health professionals. New technology such as simulation may potentially facilitate and expedite the process of learning ultrasound. Simulation may prove to be realistic, very close to real patient scanning experience for the sonographer and objectively able to assist the development of basic skills such as image manipulation, hand-eye coordination and examination technique. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to determine the face and content validity of a virtual reality simulator (ScanTrainer, MedaPhor plc, Cardiff, Wales, UK) as reflective of real transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) scanning. Method(s): A questionnaire with 14 simulator-related statements was distributed to a number of participants with differing levels of sonography experience in order to determine the level of agreement between the use of the simulator in training and real practice. Result(s): There were 36 participants: novices (n = 25) and experts (n = 11) who rated the simulator. Median scores of face validity statements between experts and non-experts using a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings ranged between 7.5 and 9.0 (p > 0.05) indicated a high level of agreement. Experts' median scores of content validity statements ranged from 8.4 to 9.0. Conclusion(s): The findings confirm that the simulator has the feel and look of real-time scanning with high face validity. Similarly, its tutorial structures and learning steps confirm the content validity.

Use of a low-cost portable 3d virtual reality gesture-mediated simulator for training and learning basic psychomotor skills in minimally invasive surgery: Development and content validity study,"Alvarez-Lopez, F.; Maina, M. F.; Saigi-Rubio, F.","Background: Simulation in virtual environments has become a new paradigm for surgeon training in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). However, this technology is expensive and difficult to access. Objective(s): This study aims first to describe the development of a new gesture-based simulator for learning skills in MIS and, second, to establish its fidelity to the criterion and sources of content-related validity evidence. Method(s): For the development of the gesture-mediated simulator for MIS using virtual reality (SIMISGEST-VR), a design-based research (DBR) paradigm was adopted. For the second objective, 30 participants completed a questionnaire, with responses scored on a 5-point Likert scale. A literature review on the validity of the MIS training-VR (MIST-VR) was conducted. The study of fidelity to the criterion was rated using a 10-item questionnaire, while the sources of content-related validity evidence were assessed using 10 questions about the simulator training capacity and 6 questions about MIS tasks, and an iterative process of instrument pilot testing was performed. Result(s): A good enough prototype of a gesture-based simulator was developed with metrics and feedback for learning psychomotor skills in MIS. As per the survey conducted to assess the fidelity to the criterion, all 30 participants felt that most aspects of the simulator were adequately realistic and that it could be used as a tool for teaching basic psychomotor skills in laparoscopic surgery (Likert score: 4.07-4.73). The sources of content-related validity evidence showed that this study's simulator is a reliable training tool and that the exercises enable learning of the basic psychomotor skills required in MIS (Likert score: 4.28-4.67). Conclusion(s): The development of gesture-based 3D virtual environments for training and learning basic psychomotor skills in MIS opens up a new approach to low-cost, portable simulation that allows ubiquitous learning and preoperative warm-up. Fidelity to the criterion was duly evaluated, which allowed a good enough prototype to be achieved. Content-related validity evidence for SIMISGEST-VR was also obtained.

Is the use of augmented reality-assisted surgery beneficial in urological education? A systematic review,"Alzouebi, I. A.; Saad, S.; Farmer, T.; Green, S.","Background: Google Glass is an optical head-mounted display that has been used in multiple medical and surgical settings to enhance delivery of education and training. This systematic review focuses solely on the use of this technology in urology operating theaters for the purpose of surgical education. Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic search strategy was employed using EMBASE (1996-2019), Medline (1946-2019) and PubMed. Search terms included optical head-mounted displays, Google Glass and urological surgical training.

Virtual simulation to personalize student learning in a required pharmacy course,"Ambroziak, K.; Ibrahim, N.; Marshall, V. D.; Kelling, S. E.","Background and purpose: Virtual simulation is used to provide a realistic and safe environment for student pharmacists to learn and practice a variety of skills in the didactic and experiential settings. Education activity and setting: The simulation program, MyDispense, that is used to teach medication dispensing in the outpatient setting was incorporated into a 2-credit hour required first-year pharmacy practice skills course. A total of 30 optional and 16 required exercises were completed by students. Finding(s): There was a total of 2,457 attempts (mean = 28.9 attempts per student) at optional practice exercises and students completed an average of 16.6 +/- 7.9 (range 1-30). While variation in the number of optional practice exercises completed was observed between students with varying levels of pharmacy experience, the difference was not statistically significant. A component of the final exam utilized the virtual simulation program and all students passed this portion of the exam based on a minimum requirement of 70.0% (mean 92.9%, range 74.5-100%). Discussion(s): Students generally identified that the use of virtual simulation was an effective tool to learn medication dispensing skills in a classroom setting. Furthermore, this created an opportunity for pharmacy practice residents to develop teaching skills. The biggest barrier to implementation was the amount of time required to create and test each exercise. The virtual simulation program allowed students to self-identify the amount of practice they thought was necessary in order to gain specific skills related to medication dispensing.

A Mobile-Based Surgical Simulation Application: A Comparative Analysis of Efficacy Using a Carpal Tunnel Release Module,"Amer, K. M.; Mur, T.; Amer, K.; Ilyas, A. M.","Purpose The utilization of surgical simulation continues to grow in medical training. The TouchSurgery application (app) is a new interactive virtual reality smartphone- or tablet-based app that offers a step-by-step tutorial and simulation for the execution of various operations. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of the app versus traditional teaching modalities utilizing the ""Carpal Tunnel Surgery"" module. We hypothesized that users of the app would score higher than those using the traditional education medium indicating higher understanding of the steps of surgery. Methods A total of 100 medical students were recruited to participate. The control group (n = 50) consisted of students learning about carpal tunnel release surgery using a video lecture utilizing slides. The study group (n = 50) consisted of students learning the procedure through the app. The content covered was identical in both groups but delivered through the different mediums. Outcome measures included comparison of test scores and overall app satisfaction. Results Test scores in the study group (89.3%) using the app were significantly higher than those in the control group (75.6%). Students in the study group rated the overall content validity, quality of graphics, ease of use, and usefulness to surgery preparation as very high (4.8 of 5). Conclusions Students utilizing the app performed better on a standardized test examining the steps of a carpal tunnel release than those using a traditional teaching modality. The study findings lend support for the use of the app for medical students to prepare for and learn the steps for various surgical procedures. Clinical relevance This study provides useful information on surgical simulation, which can be utilized to educate trainees for new procedures.

Feasibility and usability study of a pilot immersive virtual reality-based empathy training for dental providers,"Amini, H.; Gregory, M. E.; Abrams, M. A.; Luna, J.; Roland, M.; Sova, L. N.; Bean, C.; Huang, Y.; Pfeil, S. A.; Townsend, J.; Lin, E. J. D.","PURPOSE: Social determinants of health (SDOH) significantly impact individuals' engagement with the healthcare system. To address SDOH-related oral health disparities, providers must be equipped with knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) to understand how SDOH affect patients and how to mitigate these effects. Traditional dental school curricula provide limited training on recognizing SDOH or developing empathy for those with SDOH-related access barriers. This study describes the design and evaluation of such a virtual reality (VR)-based simulation in dental training. We hypothesize the simulation will increase post-training KSAs. METHOD(S): We developed ""MPATHI"" (Making Professionals Able THrough Immersion), a scripted VR simulation where participants take the role of an English-speaking caregiver with limited socioeconomic resources seeking dental care for a child in a Spanish-speaking country. The simulation is a combination of 360degree video recording and virtual scenes delivered via VR headsets. A pilot was conducted with 29 dental residents/faculty, utilizing a pre-post design to evaluate effectiveness in improving immediate and retention of KSAs toward care delivery for families facing barriers. RESULT(S): MPATHI led to increased mean scores for cognitive (pre = 3.48 +/- 0.80, post = 4.56 +/- 0.51, p < 0.001), affective (pre = 4.20 +/- 0.4, post = 4.47 +/- 0.44, p < 0.001), and skill-based learning (pre = 4.00 +/- 0.47, post = 4.52 +/- 0.37, p < 0.001) immediately post-training. There was not a significant difference between skills measured immediately post-training and in the 1-month post-training survey (p = 0.41). Participants reported high satisfaction with the content and methods used in this training. CONCLUSION(S): This pilot study supports using VR SDOH training in dental education. VR technology provides new opportunities for innovative content design.

Teaching ultrasound-guided peripheral venous catheter placement through immersive virtual reality: An explorative pilot study,"Andersen, N. L.; Jensen, R. O.; Posth, S.; Laursen, C. B.; Jorgensen, R.; Graumann, O.","INTRODUCTION: Immersive virtual reality (IVR)-based training is gaining ground as an educational tool in healthcare. When combined with well-established educational methods, IVR can potentially increase competency and autonomy in ultrasound (US)-guided peripheral venous cannulation.The aim of this study was to examine the impact of adding IVR training to a course in US-guided peripheral venous cannulation. METHOD(S): Medical students (n = 19) from the University of Southern Denmark with no former standardized US education were recruited to voluntarily participate in a pilot study, designed as a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of successful peripheral venous cannulations on a phantom. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of surface punctures on the phantom and procedure time. Participants received e-learning on the basic US before randomization to either IVR (n = 10) or no further training (n = 9). The additional IVR training comprised 10 virtual scenarios for US-guided peripheral venous catheter (PVC) placement. Students were subsequently evaluated in peripheral venous cannulation by a blinded assessor. RESULT(S): The proportion of successful peripheral venous cannulations was significantly higher in the IVR group (P <= .001). The proportions of successful cannulations were significantly higher in the IVR group compared to the control group for the 1st and 2nd PVC (P = .011, P = .023), but not for the 3rd PVC (P = .087). Similar results were found for the proportion of surface punctures (1st: P <= .001, 2nd: P = .001, and 3rd: P = .114). No significant differences in procedure times were found between the groups. CONCLUSION(S): This pilot study showed that adding an IVR-based training simulation to an existing e-learning curriculum significantly increased the learning efficacy of US-guided PVC placement for medical students.

The Effect of a Distributed Virtual Reality Simulation Training Program on Dissection Mastoidectomy Performance,"Andersen, S. A. W.; Foghsgaard, S.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Sorensen, M. S.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect on final-product performance of a distributed, virtual reality (VR) simulation training program on cadaveric dissection performance and learning curves compared with standard VR simulation training during a temporal bone course. STUDY DESIGN: Educational interventional cohort study. SETTING: The national Danish temporal bone courses of 2016 and 2017. SUBJECTS: Postgraduate year 2 to 5 residents in otorhinolaryngology. INTERVENTION: Nine participants volunteered for additional VR simulation training (intervention) before the temporal bone course, with training blocks distributed (i.e., separated). The remaining 28 participants received standard VR simulation training during the temporal bone course (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: VR simulation and cadaveric dissection final-product performances were analyzed by blinded raters using a 26-item modified Welling Scale. RESULT(S): Distributed VR simulation training before the temporal bone course (intervention) significantly increased dissection final-product performance by 25% compared with standard VR simulation training during the course (control) (mean scores 12.8 points versus 10.3 points, p < 0.01). Distributed and repeated VR simulation practice markedly decreased drilling time. Guidance by the simulator-integrated tutor-function significantly increased final-product performance by 2.3 points compared with nontutored procedures but at the cost of increased drilling time. CONCLUSION(S): Skills acquired in a VR simulation environment translate to cadaveric dissection skills and repeated and distributed VR simulation can be used to further increase performance compared with standard VR simulation training during a temporal bone course. Further dissemination of inexpensive VR simulators would allow all future temporal bone course participants to train locally before attending future centralized courses.",2018,1-Dec,"Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",39(10),,1277-1284,625030600,,,#173,Andersen 2018,,
The effect of self-directed virtual reality simulation on dissection training performance in mastoidectomy,"Andersen, S. A. W.; Foghsgaard, S.; Konge, L.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Sorensen, M. S.","Objectives/Hypothesis: To establish the effect of self-directed virtual reality (VR) simulation training on cadaveric dissection training performance in mastoidectomy and the transferability of skills acquired in VR simulation training to the cadaveric dissection training setting. Study Design: Prospective study. Method(s): Two cohorts of 20 novice otorhinolaryngology residents received either self-directed VR simulation training before cadaveric dissection training or vice versa. Cadaveric and VR simulation performances were assessed using final-product analysis with three blinded expert raters. Result(s): The group receiving VR simulation training before cadaveric dissection had a mean final-product score of 14.9 (95 % confidence interval [CI] [12.9-16.9]) compared with 9.8 (95% CI [8.4-11.1]) in the group not receiving VR simulation training before cadaveric dissection. This 52% increase in performance was statistically significantly (P < 0.0001). A single dissection mastoidectomy did not increase VR simulation performance (P = 0.22). Conclusion(s): Two hours of self-directed VR simulation training was effective in increasing cadaveric dissection mastoidectomy performance and suggests that mastoidectomy skills are transferable from VR simulation to the traditional dissection setting. Virtual reality simulation training can therefore be employed to optimize training, and can spare the use of donated material and instructional resources for more advanced training after basic competencies have been acquired in the VR simulation environment.

Am I doing this right? Structured self-assessment during simulation training of mastoidectomy improves cadaver dissection performance: a prospective educational study,"Andersen, S. A. W.; Frithioff, A.; von Buchwald, J. H.; Sorensen, M. S.; Frendo, M.","Purpose: Temporal bone surgery requires excellent surgical skills and simulation-based training can aid novices' skills acquisition. However, simulation-based training is challenged by early stagnation of performance after few performances. Structured self-assessment during practice might enhance learning by inducing reflection and engagement in the learning task. In this study, structured self-assessment was introduced during virtual reality (VR) simulation of mastoidectomy to investigate the effects on subsequent performance during cadaveric dissection. Method(s): A prospective educational study with comparison with historical controls (reference cohort). At a temporal bone dissection course, eighteen participants performed structured self-assessment during 3 h of VR simulation mastoidectomy training before proceeding to cadaver dissection (intervention cohort). At a previous course, eighteen participants received identical VR simulation training but without the structured self-assessment (reference cohort). Final products from VR simulation and cadaveric dissection were recorded and assessed by two blinded raters using a 19-point modified Welling Scale. Result(s): The intervention cohort completed fewer procedures (average 4.2) during VR simulation training than the reference cohort (average 5.7). Nevertheless, the intervention cohort achieved a significantly higher average performance score both in VR simulation (11.1 points, 95% CI [10.6-11.5]) and subsequent cadaveric dissection (11.8 points, 95% CI [10.7-12.8]) compared with the reference cohort, who scored 9.1 points (95% CI [8.7-9.5]) during VR simulation and 5.8 points (95% CI [4.8-6.8]) during cadaveric dissection. Conclusion(s): Structured self-assessment is a valuable learning support during self-directed VR simulation training of mastoidectomy and the positive effect on performance transfers to subsequent cadaveric dissection performance.

The effect of structured self-assessment in virtual reality simulation training of mastoidectomy,"Andersen, S. A. W.; Guldager, M.; Mikkelsen, P. T.; Sorensen, M. S.","Purpose: Virtual reality (VR) simulation surgical skills training is well established, but self-directed practice is often associated with a learning curve plateau. In this study, we investigate the effects of structured self-assessment as a means to improve performance in mastoidectomy training. Method(s): The study was a prospective, educational study. Two cohorts of novices (medical students) were recruited for practice of anatomical mastoidectomy in a training program with five distributed training blocks. Fifteen participants performed structured self-assessment after each procedure (intervention cohort). A reference cohort of another 14 participants served as controls. Performances were assessed by two blinded raters using a modified Welling Scale and simulator-recorded metrics. Result(s): The self-assessment cohort performed superiorly to the reference cohort (mean difference of final product score 0.87 points, p = 0.001) and substantially reduced the number of repetitions needed. The self-assessment cohort also had more passing performances for the combined metrics-based score reflecting increased efficiency. Finally, the self-assessment cohort made fewer collisions compared with the reference cohort especially with the chorda tympani, the facial nerve, the incus, and the malleus. Conclusion(s): VR simulation training of surgical skills benefits from having learners perform structured self-assessment following each procedure as this increases performance, accelerates the learning curve thereby reducing time needed for training, and induces a safer performance with fewer collisions with critical structures. Structured self-assessment was in itself not sufficient to counter the learning curve plateau and for continued skills development additional supports for deliberate practice are needed.

Retention of mastoidectomy skills after virtual reality simulation training,"Andersen, S. A. W.; Konge, L.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Sorensen, M. S.","IMPORTANCE The ultimate goal of surgical training is consolidated skills with a consistently high performance. However, surgical skills are heterogeneously retained and depend on a variety of factors, including the task, cognitive demands, and organization of practice. Virtual reality (VR) simulation is increasingly being used in surgical skills training, including temporal bone surgery, but there is a gap in knowledge on the retention of mastoidectomy skills after VR simulation training. OBJECTIVES To determine the retention of mastoidectomy skills after VR simulation training with distributed and massed practice and to investigate participants' cognitive load during retention procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective 3-month follow-up study of a VR simulation trial was conducted from February 6 to September 19, 2014, at an academic teaching hospital among 36 medical students: 19 from a cohort trained with distributed practice and 17 from a cohort trained with massed practice. INTERVENTIONS Participants performed 2 virtual mastoidectomies in a VR simulator a mean of 3.2 months (range, 2.4-5.0 months) after completing initial training with 12 repeated procedures. Practice blocks were spaced apart in time (distributed), or all procedures were performed in 1 day (massed). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Performance of the virtual mastoidectomy as assessed by 2 masked senior otologists using a modifiedWelling scale, as well as cognitive load as estimated by reaction time to perform a secondary task. RESULTS Among 36 participants, mastoidectomy final-product skills were largely retained at 3 months (mean change in score, 0.1 points; P = .89) regardless of practice schedule, but the group trained with massed practice took more time to complete the task. The performance of the massed practice group increased significantly from the first to the second retention procedure (mean change, 1.8 points; P = .001), reflecting that skills were less consolidated. For both groups, increases in reaction times in the secondary task (distributed practice group: mean pretraining relative reaction time, 1.42 [95%CI, 1.37-1.47]; mean end of training relative reaction time, 1.24 [95%CI, 1.16-1.32]; and mean retention relative reaction time, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.30-1.42]; massed practice group: mean pretraining relative reaction time, 1.34 [95%CI, 1.28-1.40]; mean end of training relative reaction time, 1.31 [95%CI, 1.21-1.42]; and mean retention relative reaction time, 1.39 [95%CI, 1.31-1.46]) indicated that cognitive load during the virtual procedures had returned to the pretraining level. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mastoidectomy skills acquired under time-distributed practice conditions were retained better than skills acquired under massed practice conditions. Complex psychomotor skills should be regularly reinforced to consolidate both motor and cognitive aspects. Virtual reality simulation training provides the opportunity for such repeated training and should be integrated into training curricula. Copyright © 2016 American Medical Association.

Cognitive Load in Mastoidectomy Skills Training: Virtual Reality Simulation and Traditional Dissection Compared,"Andersen, S. A. W.; Mikkelsen, P. T.; Konge, L.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Sorensen, M. So","Objective The cognitive load (CL) theoretical framework suggests that working memory is limited, which has implications for learning and skills acquisition. Complex learning situations such as surgical skills training can potentially induce a cognitive overload, inhibiting learning. This study aims to compare CL in traditional cadaveric dissection training and virtual reality (VR) simulation training of mastoidectomy. Design A prospective, crossover study. Participants performed cadaveric dissection before VR simulation of the procedure or vice versa. CL was estimated by secondary-task reaction time testing at baseline and during the procedure in both training modalities. Setting The national Danish temporal bone course. Participants A total of 40 novice otorhinolaryngology residents. Results Reaction time was increased by 20% in VR simulation training and 55% in cadaveric dissection training of mastoidectomy compared with baseline measurements. Traditional dissection training increased CL significantly more than VR simulation training (p < 0.001). Conclusions VR simulation training imposed a lower CL than traditional cadaveric dissection training of mastoidectomy. Learning complex surgical skills can be a challenge for the novice and mastoidectomy skills training could potentially be optimized by employing VR simulation training first because of the lower CL. Traditional dissection training could then be used to supplement skills training after basic competencies have been acquired in the VR simulation.

Cognitive load in distributed and massed practice in virtual reality mastoidectomy simulation,"Andersen, S. A. W.; Mikkelsen, P. T.; Konge, L.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Sorensen, M. So","Objectives/Hypothesis Cognitive load theory states that working memory is limited. This has implications for learning and suggests that reducing cognitive load (CL) could promote learning and skills acquisition. This study aims to explore the effect of repeated practice and simulator-integrated tutoring on CL in virtual reality (VR) mastoidectomy simulation. Study Design Prospective trial. Methods Forty novice medical students performed 12 repeated virtual mastoidectomy procedures in the Visible Ear Simulator: 21 completed distributed practice with practice blocks spaced in time and 19 participants completed massed practice (all practices performed in 1 day). Participants were randomized for tutoring with the simulator-integrated tutor function. Cognitive load was estimated by measuring reaction time in a secondary task. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models for repeated measurements. Results The mean reaction time increased by 37% during the procedure compared with baseline, demonstrating that the procedure placed substantial cognitive demands. Repeated practice significantly lowered CL in the distributed practice group but not in massed practice group. In addition, CL was found to be further increased by 10.3% in the later and more complex stages of the procedure. The simulator-integrated tutor function did not have an impact on CL. Conclusion Distributed practice decreased CL in repeated VR mastoidectomy training more consistently than was seen in massed practice. This suggests a possible effect of skills and memory consolidation occurring over time. To optimize technical skills learning, training should be organized as time-distributed practice rather than as a massed block of practice, which is common in skills-training courses.

Validation of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Module of the VirtaMed Virtual Reality Arthroscopy Trainer,"Antonis, J.; Bahadori, S.; Gallagher, K.; Immins, T.; Wainwright, T. W.; Middleton, R.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the newly developed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) module of a VR arthroscopy trainer for content, construct and face validity. DESIGN: Participants were divided into expert and novice groups based on their experience with ACL arthroscopy. Participants were given a standardized introduction, shown a video on how to use the simulator, and performed a 5-minute partial meniscectomy task, to familiarise them with the equipment. Participants then undertook an ACL reconstruction task. On completion, the simulator produced a summary of performance metrics for the following domains: Operation Time, ACL Reconstruction, Safety, Economy, Detailed Visualization and Total Score. A 7-point Likert scale questionnaire was used to assess the face and content validity of the simulator. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty one participants from a hospital orthopaedic department were recruited. Five were classified as expert, 16 as novice. RESULT(S): An independent Mann-Whitney U test showed no significant differences between experts and novices for any of the domains. Questionnaire responses regarding hand-eye coordination, camera navigation training, diagnostic training, tunnel preparation and overall training capacity were scored as either 'good' or 'excellent' by more than 70% of the participants. All responses regarding the 'graft insertion task' scored low.

Use of 360degree virtual reality video in medical obstetrical education: a quasi-experimental design,"Arents, V.; de Groot, P. C. M.; Struben, V. M. D.; van Stralen, K. J.","BACKGROUND: Video-based teaching has been part of medical education for some time but 360degree videos using a virtual reality (VR) device are a new medium that offer extended possibilities. We investigated whether adding a 360degree VR video to the internship curriculum leads to an improvement of long-term recall of specific knowledge on a gentle Caesarean Sections (gCS) and on general obstetric knowledge. METHOD(S): Two weeks prior to their Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) internship, medical students were divided in teaching groups, that did or did not have access to a VR-video of a gCS. Six weeks after their O&G internship, potentially having observed one or multiple real-life CSs, knowledge on the gCS was assessed with an open questionnaire, and knowledge on general obstetrics with a multiple-choice questionnaire. Furthermore we assessed experienced anxiety during in-person attendance of CSs, and we asked whether the interns would have wanted to attend more CSs in-person. The 360degree VR video group was questioned about their experience directly after they watched the video. We used linear regression analyses to determine significant effects on outcomes. RESULT(S): A total of 89 medical students participated, 41 in the 360degree VR video group and 48 in the conventional study group. Watching the 360degree VR video did not result in a difference in either specific or general knowledge retention between the intervention group and the conventional study group. This was both true for the grade received for the internship, the open-ended questions as well as the multiple-choice questions and this did not change after adjustment for confounding factors. Still, 83.4% of the 360degree VR video-group reported that more videos should be used in training to prepare for surgical procedures. In the 360degree VR video-group 56.7% reported side effects like nausea or dizziness. After adjustment for the number of attended CSs during the practical internship, students in the 360degree VR video-group stated less often (p=0.04) that they would have liked to attend more CSs in-person as compared to the conventional study group. CONCLUSION(S): Even though the use of 360degree VR video did not increase knowledge, it did offer a potential alternative for attending a CS in-person and a new way to prepare the students for their first operating room experiences.",2021,10-Apr,BMC medical education,21(1),,202,634786803,,,#270,Arents 2021,,

The largest reduction in time taken occurred in the first two repetitions going from 422.61s to 242.19s a reduction of 42.69 per cent. This reduction in time taken levels out after the fourth repetition. Conclusion There is a significant but steep learning curve in trainee doctors learning arthroscopy using VR simulator with haptic feedback which correlated with the first 40 minutes of training. Despite a large variation in innate arthroscopic skill, on average participants were able to significantly improve by the end of the study. There is also a reduction in the variation of arthroscopic skills between participants in later repetitions. Copyright © 2019, Australasian Medical Journal Pty Ltd.

"Extended, virtual and augmented reality in thoracic surgery: a systematic review","Arjomandi Rad, A.; Vardanyan, R.; Thavarajasingam, S. G.; Zubarevich, A.; Van den Eynde, J.; Sa, M. P. B. O.; Zhigalov, K.; Sardiari Nia, P.; Ruhparwar, A.; Weymann, A.","OBJECTIVES: Extended reality (XR), encompassing both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality, allows the user to interact with a computer-generated environment based on reality. In essence, the immersive nature of VR and augmented reality technology has been warmly welcomed in all aspects of medicine, gradually becoming increasingly feasible to incorporate into everyday practice. In recent years, XR has become increasingly adopted in thoracic surgery, although the extent of its applications is unclear. Here, we aim to review the current applications of XR in thoracic surgery. METHOD(S): A systematic database search was conducted of original articles that explored the use of VR and/or augmented reality in thoracic surgery in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane database and Google Scholar, from inception to December 2020. RESULT(S): Our search yielded 1494 citations, of which 21 studies published from 2007 to 2019 were included in this review. Three main areas were identified: (i) the application of XR in thoracic surgery training; (ii) preoperative planning of thoracic procedures; and (iii) intraoperative assistance. Overall, XR could produce progression along the learning curve, enabling trainees to reach acceptable standards before performing in the operating theatre. Preoperatively, through the generation of 3D-renderings of the thoracic cavity and lung anatomy, VR increases procedural accuracy and surgical confidence through familiarization of the patient's anatomy. XR-assisted surgery may have therapeutic use particularly for complex cases, where conventional methods would yield inadequate outcomes due to inferior accuracy. CONCLUSION(S): XR represents a salient step towards improving thoracic surgical training, as well as enhancing preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Effectiveness of simulation-based peripheral intravenous catheterization training for nursing students and hospital nurses: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Arslan, S.; Kuzu Kurban, N.; Takmak, S.; Sanlialp Zeyrek, A.; Oztik, S.; Senol, H.","BACKGROUND: Peripheral intravenous catheterisation (PIVC) is a complex procedure. AIM: This study reviewed studies evaluating the effects of different simulators in comparison with traditional methods used in PIVC training for nursing students and hospital nurses. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised (RCT) and non-randomised controlled (N-RCT) studies. METHOD(S): MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, ERIC, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect were searched using PIVC, simulation and nursing education. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system; the risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 (for RCTs) and A Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for N-RCTs. The study was conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines. RESULT(S): In total, 2,812 records were identified, and 12 studies published between 2002 and 2018 were finally included. Most studies included Virtual IV simulator and the plastic IV arm model in PIVC training for hospital nurses and nursing students, reported on outcomes such as PIVC-related knowledge, skills, confidence, state/trait anxiety and satisfaction. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, the effect sizes for all the outcomes ranged from small to moderate. However, the effect sizes were non-significant for all outcomes. The quality of evidence was assessed as being low for skills, knowledge, satisfaction, and trait/state anxiety, and moderate for confidence. CONCLUSION(S): The effect of Virtual IV training on PIVC-related skills, knowledge, satisfaction and anxiety among nursing students and hospital nurses, in comparison with the plastic arm training method, remains unclear. However, Virtual IV training was found to increase PIVC confidence. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: There is a small effect in favour of VR in PIVC education although non-significant. More evidence is needed to determine the superiority of simulation methods. In PIVC training of nurses and nursing students, hospitals and schools can choose a method in accordance with their resources. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019124599.

Role of pelvic ultrasound simulation,"Arya, S.; Mulla, Z. D.; Kupesic Plavsic, S.","BACKGROUND: Pelvic ultrasound is a critical diagnostic imaging tool in obstetrics and gynaecology. Training opportunities in transvaginal ultrasound have not kept pace with the demand among learners because of the increased complexity of modern ultrasound technology and duty-hour restrictions. Ultrasound simulation training has the potential to overcome this gap. Training opportunities in transvaginal ultrasound have not kept pace with the demand OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to determine the usefulness, applicability and attitudes toward pelvic ultrasound simulation training among residents, sonographers and practising doctors. METHOD(S): Pelvic ultrasound simulation activity using high-fidelity virtual reality ultrasound simulators lasted 4 hours and consisted of three modules: abnormal uterine bleeding, adnexal masses and bleeding in pregnancy. All learners completed a pre- and post-encounter quiz, and an anonymous post-simulation survey on the relevance of ultrasound simulation to clinical learning, and its usefulness to improve scanning performance and interpretation skills. RESULT(S): Thirty-one participants attended the workshop, and 28 (90.3%) of them responded to the survey. Five respondents agreed and 23 strongly agreed that pelvic ultrasound simulation applies to their clinical ultrasound practice, and seven of them agreed and 21 strongly agreed that their performance of ultrasound and interpretation skills will be improved following their simulation training. The average post-activity knowledge score for all three topics significantly increased (paired Student's t-test, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION(S): All 28 respondents believe that ultrasound simulation is a useful complement to learning with real patients, with the potential to improve their pelvic ultrasound performance, interpretation skills and clinical reasoning.

A Comprehensive Multicomponent Neurosurgical Course with use of Virtual Reality: Modernizing the Medical Classroom,"Atli, K.; Selman, W.; Ray, A.","OBJECTIVE: Surgical education has constantly evolved and has been recently severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While virtual reality (VR) has been utilized for resident training and neuroanatomy education, application of VR has been limited for neurosurgical education in medical school. This is the first report of a comprehensive, multicomponent teaching model with VR as a primary component to neurosurgical and neuroanatomy education for pre-clerkship medical students. DESIGN: Twelve second-year medical students were included in this prospective survey study that was conducted to evaluate a year-long neurosurgery elective course with an interactive VR platform as a primary teaching tool for neuroanatomy and neurosurgical procedures. The course had 4 components: (1) didactic/lecture-based learning, (2) problem-based learning, (3) hands-on skills lab, and (4) VR-based learning through Surgical Theater's Precision VR visualization platform. Outcome measures were based on confidence levels measured on pre- and post-course competency confidence surveys in students' ability to identify neuroanatomical structures, interpret neuroradiological imaging, and analyze neurosurgical cases, and student feedback on their experience with VR on a postcourse survey. SETTING: The survey study was conducted in the neurosurgery library and conference room at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. PARTICIPANTS: All 12 second-year medical students who enrolled in the neurosurgery zero-credit hour course completed the course. RESULT(S): At course conclusion, 100% of students reported significantly higher competency confidence levels on all topics, and 100% agreed utilizing VR helped them gain a deeper understanding of neuroanatomy/neurosurgery. 92% agreed that using VR helped them better retain the anatomical/functional details of the brain/spine, and 69% better understand neurosurgical skills taught, respectively. 100% of students found the course to be a valuable learning experience and VR a useful learning tool. CONCLUSION(S): A comprehensive multi-component neurosurgery elective course using VR as a primary teaching tool may improve neurosurgical education in medical school.

Comparing the training effectiveness of virtual reality and role play among future mental health providers,"Atuel, H. R.; Kintzle, S.","OBJECTIVE: The present study compares the effectiveness of a standardized peer-to-peer role play (RP) and a virtual client-trainer (VC-T) in training graduate-level students in the development of interviewing and clinical skills related to working with the military population. The study examines each training modality in six areas: (a) self-efficacy, (b) initial engagement, (c) recognizing and responding to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, (d) recognizing and responding to symptoms of suicide, (e) military cultural competence, and (f) overall competence. METHOD(S): A quasi-experimental nonequivalent groups study design was used. The sample comprised students enrolled in a graduate-level program (RP = 61; VC-T = 75). Participants completed pretest measures, attended training, and completed posttest measures. RESULT(S): Broadly, the findings revealed that RP and the VC-T are equally effective in increasing trainees' self-efficacy, recognition and response to posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, recognition and response to suicide symptoms, military cultural competence, and overall competence. These results suggest that regardless of training modality, trainees demonstrated increased clinical skills and competencies needed for working with the military population. CONCLUSION(S): The results suggest that both RP and the VC-T are equally effective, which opens the possibilities of implementing the VC-T as a training tool that has greater reach compared with RP. As more graduate programs offer an online version of their traditional on-ground coursework, the VC-T is an opportunity to have 1 training platform for both on-ground and online students.

The force pyramid: A spatial analysis of force application during virtual reality brain tumor resection,"Azarnoush, H.; Siar, S.; Sawaya, R.; Al Zhrani, G.; Winkler-Schwartz, A.; Alotaibi, F. E.; Bugdadi, A.; Bajunaid, K.; Marwa, I.; Sabbagh, A. J.; Del Maestro, R. F.","OBJECTIVE Virtual reality simulators allow development of novel methods to analyze neurosurgical performance. The concept of a force pyramid is introduced as a Tier 3 metric with the ability to provide visual and spatial analysis of 3D force application by any instrument used during simulated tumor resection. This study was designed to answer 3 questions: 1) Do study groups have distinct force pyramids? 2) Do handedness and ergonomics influence force pyramid structure? 3) Are force pyramids dependent on the visual and haptic characteristics of simulated tumors? METHODS Using a virtual reality simulator, NeuroVR (formerly NeuroTouch), ultrasonic aspirator force application was continually assessed during resection of simulated brain tumors by neurosurgeons, residents, and medical students. The participants performed simulated resections of 18 simulated brain tumors with different visual and haptic characteristics. The raw data, namely, coordinates of the instrument tip as well as contact force values, were collected by the simulator. To provide a visual and qualitative spatial analysis of forces, the authors created a graph, called a force pyramid, representing force sum along the z-coordinate for different xy coordinates of the tool tip. RESULTS Sixteen neurosurgeons, 15 residents, and 84 medical students participated in the study. Neurosurgeon, resident and medical student groups displayed easily distinguishable 3D ""force pyramid fingerprints."" Neurosurgeons had the lowest force pyramids, indicating application of the lowest forces, followed by resident and medical student groups. Handedness, ergonomics, and visual and haptic tumor characteristics resulted in distinct well-defined 3D force pyramid patterns. CONCLUSIONS Force pyramid fingerprints provide 3D spatial assessment displays of instrument force application during simulated tumor resection. Neurosurgeon force utilization and ergonomic data form a basis for understanding and modulating resident force application and improving patient safety during tumor resection.

Development and validation of metric-based-training to proficiency simulation curriculum for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy using a novel assessment checklist,"Azzam, N.; Khamis, N.; Almadi, M.; Batwa, F.; Alsohaibani, F.; Aljebreen, A.; Alharbi, A.; Alaska, Y.; Alameel, T.; Irving, P.; Satava, R.","Background/Aims: This study aimed to design a structured simulation training curriculum for upper endoscopy and validate a new assessment checklist. Material(s) and Method(s): A proficiency-based progression stepwise curriculum was developed consisting of didactic, technical and non-technical components using a virtual reality simulator (VRS). It focused on: scope navigation, anatomical landmarks identification, mucosal inspection, retro-flexion, pathology identification, and targeting biopsy. A total of 5 experienced and 10 novice endoscopists were recruited. All participants performed each of the selected modules twice, and mean and median performance were compared between the two groups. Novices pre-set level of proficiency was set as 2 standard deviations below the mean of experts. Performance was assessed using multiple-choice questions for knowledge, while validated simulator parameters incorporated into a novel checklist; Simulation Endoscopic Skill Assessment Score (SESAS) were used for technical skills. Result(s): The following VRS outcome measures have shown expert vs novice baseline discriminative ability: total procedure time, number of attempts for esophageal intubation and time in red-out. All novice trainees achieved the preset level of proficiency by the end of training. There were no statistically significant differences between experts' and trainees' rate of complications, landmarks identification and patient discomfort. SESAS checklist showed high degree of agreement with the VRS metrices (kappa = 0.83) and the previously validated direct observation of procedural skills tool (kappa = 0.90). Conclusion(s): The Fundamentals of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy simulation training curriculum and its SESAS global assessment tool have been primarily validated and can serve as a valuable addition to the gastroenterology fellowship programs. Follow up study of trainee performance in workplaces is recommended for consequences validation. Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Training outcomes for audiology students using virtual reality or traditional training methods,"Bakhos, D.; Galvin, J.; Aoustin, J. M.; Robier, M.; Kerneis, S.; Bechet, G.; Montembault, N.; Laurent, S.; Godey, B.; Aussedat, C.","Due to limited space and resources, it can be difficult to train students on audiological procedures adequately. In the present study, we compared audiology training outcomes between a traditional approach and a recently developed immersive virtual reality (VR) approach in audiology students. Twenty-nine first-year audiology students participated in the study; 14 received traditional training (""TT group""), and 15 received the VR training (""VRT group""). Pre- and post-training evaluation included a 20-item test developed by an audiology educator. Post-training satisfaction and self-confidence were evaluated using Likert scales. Mean post-training test scores improved by 6.9+/-9.8 percentage points in the TT group and by 21.1 +/-7.8 points in the VRT group; the improvement in scores was significant for both groups. After completing the traditional training, the TT group was subsequently trained with the VR system, after which mean scores further improved by 7.5 points; there was no significant difference in post-VR training scores between the TT and VRT groups. After training, the TT and VRT groups completed satisfaction and self-confidence questionnaires. Satisfaction and self-confidence ratings were significantly higher for the VR training group, compared to the traditional training group. Satisfaction ratings were ""good"" (4 on Likert scale) for 74% of the TT group and 100% of the VRT group. Self-confidence ratings were ""good"" for 71% of the TT group and 92% of the VRT group. These results suggest that a VR training approach may be an effective alternative or supplement to traditional training for audiology students. Copyright © 2020 Bakhos et al.

Leveraging virtual reality to train certified nursing assistants as essential dementia-care personnel in the age of COVID-19,"Balas, J. S.; Phelps, E. B.; Shaw, C.; Washington, E.; Glover, C. M.; Ludwig, G. A.; Bennett, D. A.; Fleischman, D. A.; Volgman, A. S.; Aggarwal, N. T.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has placed an extraordinary and disproportionate level of responsibility and risk on certified nursing assistants (CNAs) caring for persons with dementia (PWD) relative to their training, resources, and compensation levels. Nearly one-quarter of COVID-19 deaths in the United States have been nursing home residents and staff. Despite providing the majority of direct care, CNAs are amongst the most under-resourced and under-trained frontline workers. Given their essentiality, it is critical to support CNAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this work is to provide CNAs with a space to strengthen their knowledge and confidence in caring for PWD. This pilot study applies a virtual reality (VR) curriculum to train CNAs regarding the lived experiences of PWD and their loved ones. The VR vignette portrays a Latinx woman, Beatriz, through progressive stages of Alzheimer's disease. METHOD(S): Chicago Methodist Senior Services (CMSS) CNAs were recruited (N=7; 86% female, 86% Black) for a seven-week online training program consisting of 1.5 hours per week. Each class included a didactic lecture and an Embodied Labs VR module depicting a first-person experience of dementia through a distributive model approach. The program concluded with two recorded focus groups. Participants completed the UCLA Geriatric Attitudes Scale, a dementia knowledge assessment, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index surveys, and a COVID-19 Impact questionnaire. Current analyses include qualitative content analysis for focus group data and descriptive, quantitative statistics for pre-and post-VR intervention surveys. RESULT(S): Preliminary results demonstrate that CNAs endorsed a positive change in attitudes toward older adults (p=0.069), a deepened understanding of dementia, and increased confidence in caregiving skills. Focus groups allowed CNAs to discuss changes in resident behavior and support one another through a virtual platform during a global pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): Combining traditional didactic lectures with VR-based curricula provided CNAs with foundational knowledge and first-hand experience of dementia pathology. Participants reported greater levels of insight and empathy for PWD. Future aims include expansion of training content to include end-of-life conversations, LGBTQIA aging, and Lewy body dementia.

Virtual reality compared with bench-top simulation in the acquisition of arthroscopic skill: A randomized controlled trial,"Banaszek, D.; You, D.; Chang, J.; Pickell, M.; Hesse, D.; Hopman, W. M.; Borschneck, D.; Bardana, D.","Background: Work-hour restrictions as set forth by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and other governing bodies have forced training programs to seek out new learning tools to accelerate acquisition of both medical skills and knowledge. As a result, competency-based training has become an important part of residency training. The purpose of this study was to directly compare arthroscopic skill acquisition in both high-fidelity and low-fidelity simulator models and to assess skill transfer from either modality to a cadaveric specimen, simulating intraoperative conditions. Method(s): Forty surgical novices (pre-clerkship-level medical students) voluntarily participated in this trial. Baseline demographic data, as well as data on arthroscopic knowledge and skill, were collected prior to training. Subjects were randomized to 5-week independent training sessions on a high-fidelity virtual reality arthroscopic simulator or on a bench-top arthroscopic setup, or to an untrained control group. Post-training, subjects were asked to perform a diagnostic arthroscopy on both simulators and in a simulated intraoperative environment on a cadaveric knee. A more difficult surprise task was also incorporated to evaluate skill transfer. Subjects were evaluated using the Global Rating Scale (GRS), the 14-point arthroscopic checklist, and a timer to determine procedural efficiency (time per task).

Virtual Reality Single-Port Sleeve Gastrectomy Training Decreases Physical and Mental Workload in Novice Surgeons: An Exploratory Study,"Barre, J.; Michelet, D.; Truchot, J.; Jolivet, E.; Recanzone, T.; Stiti, S.; Tesniere, A.; Pourcher, G.","Background: Novice surgeons experience high levels of physical and mental workload during the early stages of their curriculum and clinical practice. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is the first bariatric procedure worldwide. Feasibility and safety of single-port sleeve gastrectomy (SPSG) has been demonstrated. An immersive virtual reality (VR) simulation was developed to provide a repetitive exercise to learn this novel technique. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the VR training tool on mental and physical workload in novice surgeons. The secondary objective included an evaluation of the VR simulator. Method(s): A monocentric-controlled trial was conducted. Ten participants were divided into two groups, the VR group and the control group (without VR training). Surgery residents participated in a first real case of SPSG and a second case 1 month later. The VR group underwent a VR training between the two surgeries. Mental and physical loads were assessed with self-assessment questionnaires: NASA-TLX, Borg scale, and manikin discomfort test. The VR simulator was evaluated through presence, cybersickness, and usability questionnaires. Result(s): This study showed a decrease of the mental demand and effort dimensions of NASA-TLX between the first and the second surgery in the VR group (P <.05). During the second surgery, a marginally significant difference was shown concerning the mental demand between the two groups. Postural discomfort of the VR group decreased with practice (P <.01), mainly between the first and the second surgery (P <.05). Furthermore, participants characterized the VR simulator as realistic, usable, and very useful to learned surgery. Conclusion(s): This exploratory study showed an improvement in mental and physical workload when novice surgeons trained with VR (repetitive practice, gesture improvement, reduction of stress, etc.).

Does virtual reality simulation have a role in training trauma and orthopaedic surgeons?,"Bartlett, J. D.; Lawrence, J. E.; Stewart, M. E.; Nakano, N.; Khanduja, V.","Aims The aim of this study was to assess the current evidence relating to the benefits of virtual reality (VR) simulation in orthopaedic surgical training, and to identify areas of future research. Materials and Methods A literature search using the MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar databases was performed. The results' titles, abstracts, and references were examined for relevance. Results A total of 31 articles published between 2004 and 2016 and relating to the objective validity and efficacy of specific virtual reality orthopaedic surgical simulators were identified. We found 18 studies demonstrating the construct validity of 16 different orthopaedic virtual reality simulators by comparing expert and novice performance. Eight studies have demonstrated skill acquisition on a simulator by showing improvements in performance with repeated use. A further five studies have demonstrated measurable improvements in operating theatre performance following a period of virtual reality simulator training. Conclusion The demonstration of 'real-world' benefits from the use of VR simulation in knee and shoulder arthroscopy is promising. However, evidence supporting its utility in other forms of orthopaedic surgery is lacking. Further studies of validity and utility should be combined with robust analyses of the cost efficiency of validated simulators to justify the financial investment required for their use in orthopaedic training.

P.; Hussain, M.; Kogler, M.; Koutsopodioti, N.; Uddin, W.; Beckley, I.; Abubakar, H.; Gill, D.; Smith, D.","BACKGROUND: Medical simulators offer an invaluable educational resource for medical trainees. However, owing to cost and portability restrictions, they have traditionally been limited to simulation centres. With the advent of sophisticated mobile technology, simulators have become cheaper and more accessible. Touch Surgery is one such freely downloadable mobile application simulator (MAS) used by over one million healthcare professionals worldwide. Nevertheless, to date, it has never been formally validated as an adjunct in undergraduate medical education. METHODS: Medical students in the final 3 years of their programme were recruited and randomised to one of three revision interventions: 1) no formal revision resources, 2) traditional revision resources, or 3) MAS. Students completed pre-test questionnaires and were then assessed on their ability to complete an undisclosed male urinary catheterisation scenario. Following a one-hour quarantined revision period, all students repeated the scenario. Both attempts were scored by allocation-blinded examiners against an objective 46-point mark scheme. RESULTS: A total of 27 medical students were randomised (n=9 per group). Mean scores improved between baseline and post-revision attempts by 8.7% (p=0.003), 19.8% (p=0.0001), and 15.9% (p=0.001) for no resources, traditional resources, and MAS, respectively. However, when comparing mean score improvements between groups there were no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile simulators offer an unconventional, yet potentially useful adjunct to enhance undergraduate clinical skills education. Our results indicate that MAS's perform comparably to current gold-standard revision resources; however, they may confer significant advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and practice flexibility.

Operative and diagnostic hysteroscopy: A novel learning model combining new animal models and virtual reality simulation,"Bassil, A.; Rubod, C.; Borghesi, Y.; Kerbage, Y.; Schreiber, E. S.; Azais, H.; Garabedian, C.","Context Hysteroscopy is one of the most common gynaecological procedure. Training for diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy can be achieved through numerous previously described models like animal models or virtual reality simulation. We present our novel combined model associating virtual reality and bovine uteruses and bladders. Study design End year residents in obstetrics and gynaecology attended a full day workshop. The workshop was divided in theoretical courses from senior surgeons and hands-on training in operative hysteroscopy and virtual reality Essure<sup></sup> procedures using the EssureSimTM and PelvicsimTM simulators with multiple scenarios. Theoretical and operative knowledge was evaluated before and after the workshop and General Points Averages (GPAs) were calculated and compared using a Student's T test. Results GPAs were significantly higher after the workshop was completed. The biggest difference was observed in operative knowledge (0,28 GPA before workshop versus 0,55 after workshop, p < 0,05). All of the 25 residents having completed the workshop applauded the realism an efficiency of this type of training. The force feedback allowed by the cattle uteruses gives the residents the possibility to manage thickness of resection as in real time surgery. Furthermore, the two-horned bovine uteruses allowed to reproduce septa resection in conditions close to human surgery Conclusion Teaching operative and diagnostic hysteroscopy is essential. Managing this training through a full day workshop using a combined animal model and virtual reality simulation is an efficient model not described before.

Experience gained during vitreoretinal fellowships in the United Kingdom,"Bassilious, K.; Moussa, G.; Kalogeropoulos, D.; Ch'ng, S. W.; Andreatta, W.","Background: There are 16 vitreoretinal (VR) fellowships listed on the British and Eire Association of Vitreoretinal Surgeons (BEAVRS) website offering places to 23 applicants, however, this list is not exhaustive. The purpose of this survey was to evaluate surgical volume, training, and experience of VR fellows in the UK. Method(s): An anonymous survey was disseminated online to current and past VR fellows who are members of BEAVRS. Participants were asked about their surgical experience and confidence, before and during their fellowship, in performing a variety of procedures. Participants were also asked about their academic achievements and their career prospects. Result(s): All 26 respondents felt that their fellowship met their surgical needs and would recommend it to others. Upon completion, 92% felt prepared to work as a consultant. Following fellowship completion, the median (IQR) number of procedures performed were: phacoemulsification: 91 (51-131), pars-plana vitrectomy (PPV): 351 (226-451), simple-retinal detachment (RD): 176 (126-226), complex-RD: 31 (16-51), scleral buckle (SB): 16 (80-26), membrane-peels: 76 (41-88), intraocular-foreign body (IOFB) removal: 3 (3-3), indirect laser: 51 (11-91), scleral-fixated intraocular-lens (sfIOL): 3 (3-8), removal-of-dropped-nucleus (RODN): 16 (8-26), diabetic membrane delaminations: 16 (8-16); with an increase of confidence in performing all VR procedures (p < 0.001). Participants completed 2 (1-2) presentations and 2 (0-3) papers with no difference in academic performance between those with/without postgraduate qualifications (p = 0.409). Conclusion(s): Overall, fellowships in the UK are of a high quality and prepare the fellow adequately for progression into a consultant post. They help increase surgical confidence and provide opportunities to complete academic work. Fellowships without VR on-call commitments can be improved by incorporating on-call duties.

Evaluation of Pre-Training with the da Vinci Skills Simulator on Motor Skill Acquisition in a Surgical Robotics Curriculum,"Battaglia, E.; Mueller, B.; Hogg, D.; Rege, R.; Scott, D.; Fey, A. M.","Training for robotic surgery can be challenging due the complexity of the technology, as well as a high demand for the robotic systems that must be primarily used for clinical care. While robotic surgical skills are traditionally trained using the robotic hardware coupled with physical simulated tissue models and test-beds, there has been an increasing interest in using virtual reality simulators. Use of virtual reality (VR) comes with some advantages, such as the ability to record and track metrics associated with learning. However, evidence of skill transfer from virtual environments to physical robotic tasks has yet to be fully demonstrated. In this work, we evaluate the effect of virtual reality pre-Training on performance during a standardized robotic dry-lab training curriculum, where trainees perform a set of tasks and are evaluated with a score based on completion time and errors made during the task. Results show that VR pre-Training is weakly significant (p<=0.1) in reducing the number of repetitions required to achieve proficiency on the robotic task; however, it is not able to significantly improve performance in any robotic tasks. This suggests that important skills are learned during physical training with the surgical robotic system that cannot yet be replaced with VR training.

Validation of a Virtual Reality-Based Hip Arthroscopy Simulator,"Bauer, D. E.; Wieser, K.; Aichmair, A.; Zingg, P. O.; Dora, C.; Rahm, S.","Purpose: To assess construct and face validity of a novel virtual reality-based hip arthroscopy simulator using the previously validated Arthroscopic Surgery Skills Evaluation Tool (ASSET), metric parameters, and a questionnaire. Method(s): Metric parameters including task completion time, camera path, and grasper path were recorded, and the ASSET score was used to assess construct validity. Face validity was evaluated using a questionnaire. Result(s): Nine hip arthroscopy experts, of whom the majority performed more than 200 procedures (age, 48 +/- 7.3; range, 38-61 years; 8 men, 1 woman), and 33 nonexperts (age, 33 +/- 7.9; range, 26-62 years; 25 men, 8 women) performed 3 individual tasks on a virtual reality-based arthroscopy simulator of a left hip. The ASSET global rating scale showed a statistically significant difference between the hip arthroscopy expert and the nonexpert group, indicating strong construct validity (25.0 in the expert group, range, 17-34, versus 15.30 in the nonexpert group, range, 8-30 [P < .001], respectively). This also applied to most metric parameters recorded by the simulator. The simulator also demonstrated high face validity. The overall impression in terms of realism was graded ""completely realistic"" by 17% and ""close to realistic"" by 62% of participants. Conclusion(s): The tested simulator demonstrated high construct and face validity. Clinical Relevance: This study demonstrates the construct and face validity of a novel hip arthroscopy simulator.

Effect of a game-based virtual reality phone application on tracheostomy care education for nursing students: A randomized controlled trial,"Bayram, S. B.; Caliskan, N.","BACKGROUND: A game-based virtual reality phone application is used as a simulation to teach psychomotor skills in nursing education. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims at determining the effect of a game-based virtual reality phone application on tracheostomy care education for nursing students. DESIGN: Single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted from March-April 2017. SETTING: Department of Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, Central Anatolia of Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 86 first-year nursing students registered in Fundamentals of Nursing-II were included in this study. The students were divided at random into two groups, control (n=43) and experimental (n=43). METHOD(S): The data were collected with an informative features form, a tracheostomy care knowledge test and skill checklists, and a performance assessment form. The control group commenced the study first so that the students did not affect each other. After the students completed the theoretical class, laboratory class, and small group study, they had their knowledge test and skills evaluation. The application featured tracheostomy care and was designed in support of formal education. It was uploaded to the mobile phones of the experimental group at a different phase of the study from the control group. After the experimental group made use of this application for seven days, their last knowledge test and skills evaluation were conducted. RESULT(S): The results of this study determined that the suctioning a tracheostomy tube and peristomal skin care average final test scores of the students in the experiment group were higher than the average scores of the students in the control group; this was statistically significant (p=0.017, p=0.003). CONCLUSION(S): The game-based virtual reality phone application was effective in teaching the skill of suctioning a tracheostomy tube for nursing students in the short term, and it is recommended that this application be used in psychomotor skill training.

In the Fundamentals of Endovascular and Vascular Surgery model motion metrics reliably differentiate competency,"Belvroy, V. M.; Murali, B.; Sheahan, M. G.; O'Malley, M. K.; Bismuth, J.","Objective: The Fundamentals of Endovascular and Vascular Surgery, a curriculum that includes an endovascular model for skills testing, aims to differentiate between competent and noncompetent performers. The aim of our study was to further validate the model and to test its reliability in assessing the performance of endovascular trainees in an uncontrolled setting. Method(s): The model was tested exclusively in a virtual reality environment. On the basis of their endovascular experience, 52 participants were divided into three groups: novice (<50 endovascular cases), intermediate (50-500 endovascular cases), and expert (>500 endovascular cases). Performance was evaluated in four tasks, measuring the tool tip position and velocity on the virtual model. Average tool tip velocity and movement smoothness in the velocity frequency domain are validated parameters defining proficiency of movement. The data were filtered and interpolated to calculate the metrics. Trials containing critical tool manipulation errors were excluded. Result(s): In total, 52 tasks completed by novices, 25 completed by intermediates, and 38 completed by experts were analyzed to determine performance. The difference in performance between the novice and expert groups was statistically significant for guidewire smoothness (P < .001). The expert group had a statistically significantly higher average guidewire velocity compared with the novice group (P < .001). Conclusion(s): The Fundamentals of Endovascular and Vascular Surgery model continues to differentiate novices from experts on the basis of their handling of guidewire and catheter tools, measured as smoothness and velocity. This model offers a useful instrument to test competency of endovascular surgeons.

"The effect of self-practicing systematic clinical observations in a multiplayer, immersive, interactive virtual reality application versus physical equipment: a randomized controlled trial","Berg, H.; Steinsbekk, A.","This study aimed to investigate whether group self-practice of systematic clinical observation using the airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure (ABCDE) approach in a multiplayer, immersive, interactive virtual reality (VR) application provided a non-inferior learning outcome compared to practicing with physical equipment in first-year medical and nursing students. The study was a non-inferior, parallel-group randomized controlled trial. After a 15-min introduction session on the ABCDE approach, all students were randomly allocated to practice ABCDE in groups of three for 20 min either in a fully immersive, interactive, multiplayer virtual reality application (the VR group) or with physical equipment (the TP group). The primary outcome was the number of students who documented all predefined observations in the correct order of the ABCDE approach on a practical test performed immediately after group practice. A total of 84% of all eligible students participated, with 146 students in the VR group and 143 in the TP group. On the primary outcome, 20% in the VR group and 21% in the TP group got everything correct (absolute difference 1% point, one-sided 95% confidence interval 1.0-8.8% points), showing non-inferiority of the virtual reality application.

Virtual Reality Simulation Has Weak Correlation with Overall Trainee Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Performance,"Berges, A. J.; Vedula, S. S.; Malpani, A.; Chen, C. C. G.","Study Objective: Both simulator practice and intraoperative performance serve to inform surgical trainee training, but the skill transfer from simulation to the intraoperative setting remains unclear. This study evaluates the correlation between trainee performance on virtual reality simulation and (1) overall intraoperative performance during robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy (RALH) procedures and (2) suturing performance during vaginal cuff closure portion of the case. Design(s): Retrospective subgroup analysis of randomized controlled trial. Setting(s): Academic hospital. Patient(s): Patients with RALH (N = 29). Intervention(s): Gynecological trainees (N = 21) performed simulation tasks using the da Vinci skills simulator on the day of surgery before performing RALH. Attending surgeons assessed participants' intraoperative performance using Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS). Performance of the vaginal cuff closure step was subsequently assessed using GEARS scoring of anonymized videos. Spearman's correlation was used to quantify the relationship between simulation and intraoperative performances. Measurements and Main Results: Trainees achieved a median intraoperative GEARS score of 18.5/30 (interquartile range: 17-22) and a median total simulator score of 84.4/100 (interquartile range: 78.1-87.5). More advanced residents exhibited worse overall simulator performance (median score 86.6/100 compared with 78.8/100, p = .03) and similar intraoperative GEARS scores during overall RALH and vaginal cuff closure compared with less experienced trainees. Total simulation performance score was negatively correlated with GEARS Bimanual Dexterity (rho = -0.46, p = .02) and Force Sensitivity subscores (rho = -0.39, p = .05). There was no correlation between total GEARS intraoperative vaginal cuff closure scores and overall simulation performances; however, total Tubes simulation score was correlated with higher GEARS Force Sensitivity subscore (rho = 0.73, p = .05). Conclusion(s): In this study, there was limited correlation between simulation score metrics and trainees' overall intraoperative performance. Furthermore, we identified that GEARS scores could not distinguish between similar trainee skill levels. These findings underscore the need to develop intraoperative assessment tools that can better discriminate different but similar skill levels.

Method(s): A single-center prospective study assessed surgical teaching using 3D video tutorials designed for French neurosurgery and ENT residents participating in the neuro-otology lateral skull-base workshop of the French College of Neurosurgery. At the end of the session, students filled out an evaluation form with 5-point Likert scale to assess the teaching and the positive and negative points of this teaching tool. Result(s): Twenty-two residents in neurosurgery (n = 17, 81.0%) and ENT (n = 5) were included. Eighteen felt that the 3D video enhanced their understanding of the surgical approach (81.8%). Fifteen (68.2%) thought the video provided good 3D visualization of anatomical structures and 20 that it enabled better understanding of anatomical relationships (90.9%).

This study aimed to design and validate a virtual reality CBC for an advanced laparoscopic procedure: sigmoid colectomy. Design This was a multicenter randomized study. Novice (surgeons who had performed <5 laparoscopic colorectal resections as primary operator), intermediate (between 10 and 20), and experienced surgeons (>50) were enrolled. Validity evidence for the metrics given by the virtual reality simulator, the LAP Mentor, was based on the second attempt of each task in between groups. The tasks assessed were 3 modules of a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy (medial dissection [MD], lateral dissection [LD], and anastomosis) and a full procedure (FP). Novice surgeons were randomized to 1 of 2 groups to perform 8 further attempts of all 3 modules or FP, for learning curve analysis. Setting Two academic tertiary care centers-division of surgery of St. Mary's campus, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London and Nord Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, were involved. Participants Novice surgeons were residents in digestive surgery at St. Mary's and Nord Hospitals. Intermediate and experienced surgeons were board-certified academic surgeons. Results A total of 20 novice surgeons, 7 intermediate surgeons, and 6 experienced surgeons were enrolled. Evidence for validity based on experience was identified in MD, LD, and FP for time (p = 0.005, p = 0.003, and p = 0.001, respectively), number of movements (p = 0.013, p = 0.005, and p = 0.001, respectively), and path length (p = 0.03, p = 0.017, and p = 0.001, respectively), and only for time (p = 0.03) and path length (p = 0.013) in the anastomosis module. Novice surgeons' performance significantly improved through repetition for time, movements, and path length in MD, LD, and FP.

User experience with low-cost virtual reality cancer surgery simulation in an african setting,"Bing, E. G.; Brown, M. L.; Cuevas, A.; Sullivan, R.; Parham, G. P.","PURPOSE Limited access to adequate cancer surgery training is one of the driving forces behind global inequities in surgical cancer care. Affordable virtual reality (VR) surgical training could enhance surgical skills in low- and middle-income settings, but most VR and augmented reality systems are too expensive and do not teach open surgical techniques commonly practiced in these contexts. New low-cost VR can offer skill development simulations relevant to these settings, but little is known about how knowledge is gained and applied by surgeons training and working in specific resource-constrained settings. This study addresses this gap, exploring gynecologic oncology trainee learning and user experience using a low-cost VR simulator to learn to perform an open radical abdominal hysterectomy in Lusaka, Zambia. METHODS Eleven surgical trainees rotating through the gynecologic oncology service were sequentially recruited from the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka to participate in a study evaluating a VR radical abdominal hysterectomy training designed to replicate the experience in a Zambian hospital. Six participated in semi-structured interviews following the training. Interviews were analyzed using open and axial coding, informed by grounded theory. RESULTS Simulator participation increased participants' perception of their surgical knowledge, confidence, and skills. Participants believed their skills transferred to other related surgical procedures. Having clear goals and motivation to improve were described as factors that influenced success. CONCLUSION For cancer surgery trainees in lower-resourced settings learning medical and surgical skills, even for those with limited VR experience, low-cost VR simulators may enhance anatomical knowledge and confidence. The VR simulator reinforced anatomical and clinical knowledge acquired through other modalities. VR-enhanced learning may be particularly valuable when mentored learning opportunities are limited.

Using low-cost virtual reality simulation to build surgical capacity for cervical cancer treatment,"Bing, E. G.; Parham, G. P.; Cuevas, A.; Fisher, B.; Skinner, J.; Mwanahamuntu, M.; Sullivan, R.","PURPOSE Worldwide, more than 80% of people diagnosed with cancer will require surgery during their disease course, but only 5% to 20% of low- and middle-income countries have access to safe, affordable, and timely surgery. Developing surgical oncology skills requires significant time and mentoring. Virtual reality (VR) simulators can reduce the time required to master surgical procedures but are prohibitively expensive. We sought to determine whether a VR simulator using low-cost computer gaming equipment could train novice surgeons in Africa to perform a virtual radical abdominal (open) hysterectomy (RAH). METHODS Our RAH VR simulator used the Oculus Rift (Oculus VR, Menlo Park, CA), a VR headset with hand controllers that costs less than $1,500. Surgical novices learned to perform five key steps of a virtual RAH. We measured and identified predictors of movement and time efficiency for the simulation. RESULTS Ten novice surgeons in Lusaka, Zambia, enrolled in the study. Movement and time efficiency greatly improved over time. Independent predictors of movement efficiency were number of simulations, surgical experience, and time since college graduation. Independent predictors of time efficiency were number of simulations, surgical experience, days between simulation sessions, age, sex, and an interaction between number of simulations and surgical experience. CONCLUSION Low-cost VR may be an effective tool to help surgical novices learn complex surgical oncology procedures. If learning to perform VR surgical procedures with low-cost hardware leads to faster mastery of surgical procedures in the operating room, low-cost VR may represent one of the solutions to increasing access to surgical cancer care globally.

Subjects consisted of 12 novices (medical students, postgraduate year [PGY] 1-2), 5 intermediate trainees (PGY3-4), 9 senior trainees (PGY5 and fellows), and 4 attending faculty. Simulator metrics were recorded and then compiled to generate a total simulator score (TSS). The loose body retrieval was graded using the ASSET scoring tool. Inter-rater and intrarater reliability for the ASSET for 2 blinded raters and construct validity of the ASSET and the TSS were calculated. Correlation between the TSS, ASSET and individual simulator metrics was determined. Result(s): Prior simulation experience (P <= 0.01) correlated with higher TSS and higher ASSET, while video game experience correlated with higher TSS on the diagnostic module only (P = 0.004). There was a significant difference in ASSET score among all experience groups (P < 0.04). Novices had the lowest mean ASSET whereas experts had the highest mean ASSET with a difference of 17.4 points. Overall performance on the surgical module significantly correlated with the ASSET score (r = 0.444, P = 0.016). There was a significant positive correlation among higher ASSET and number of loose bodies retrieved, operation time, camera path and grasper path length, and percentage of cartilage injury. ASSET demonstrated excellent intrarater reliability and showed substantial or better inter-reliability in 8 of 9 domains. Conclusion(s): The VirtaMed hip arthroscopy simulator demonstrated good construct validity and excellent reliability for simulator-based metrics and ASSET score. Use of both simulator metrics and ASSET offers a more comprehensive performance assessment on hip arthroscopy simulation than either measure alone. Clinical Relevance: As virtual reality simulation for arthroscopy becomes more commonplace in orthopaedic training, evaluation of the most effective objective and subjective measures of performance is necessary to optimize simulation training.

Artificial Intelligence Distinguishes Surgical Training Levels in a Virtual Reality Spinal Task,"Bissonnette, V.; Mirchi, N.; Ledwos, N.; Alsidieri, G.; Winkler-Schwartz, A.; Del Maestro, R. F.","Background:With the emergence of competency-based training, the current evaluation scheme of surgical skills is evolving to include newer methods of assessment and training. Artificial intelligence through machine learning algorithms can utilize extensive data sets to analyze operator performance. This study aimed to address 3 questions: (1) Can artificial intelligence uncover novel metrics of surgical performance? (2) Can support vector machine algorithms be trained to differentiate ""senior"" and ""junior"" participants who are executing a virtual reality hemilaminectomy? (3) Can other algorithms achieve a good classification performance?Methods:Participants from 4 Canadian universities were divided into 2 groups according to their training level (senior and junior) and were asked to perform a virtual reality hemilaminectomy. The position, angle, and force application of the simulated burr and suction instruments, along with tissue volumes that were removed, were recorded at 20-ms intervals. Raw data were manipulated to create metrics to train machine learning algorithms. Five algorithms, including a support vector machine, were trained to predict whether the task was performed by a senior or junior participant. The accuracy of each algorithm was assessed through leave-one-out cross-validation. Result(s):Forty-one individuals were enrolled (22 senior and 19 junior participants). Twelve metrics related to safety of the procedure, efficiency, motion of the tools, and coordination were selected. Following cross-validation, the support vector machine achieved a 97.6% accuracy. The other algorithms achieved accuracy of 92.7%, 87.8%, 70.7%, and 65.9%, respectively. Conclusion(s):Artificial intelligence defined novel metrics of surgical performance and outlined training levels in a virtual reality spinal simulation procedure.Clinical Relevance:The significance of these results lies in the potential of artificial intelligence to complement current educational paradigms and better prepare residents for surgical procedures.

Randomized trial to examine procedure-to-procedure transfer in laparoscopic simulator training,"Bjerrum, F.; Sorensen, J. L.; Konge, L.; Rosthoj, S.; Lindschou, J.; Ottesen, B.; Strandbygaard, J.","Background: Laparoscopic simulation has become a standard component of surgical training, but there is limited knowledge regarding skills transfer between procedural tasks. The objective was to investigate the specificity of procedural simulator training. Method(s): This was randomized single-centre educational superiority trial. Surgical novices practised basic skills on a laparoscopic virtual reality simulator. On reaching proficiency, participants were randomized to proficiency-based training. The intervention group practised two procedures on the simulator (appendicectomy followed by salpingectomy), whereas the control group trained on only one procedure (salpingectomy). The main outcomes were number of repetitions and time to proficiency for the second procedure. Result(s): Ninety-six participants were randomized, of whom 74 per cent were women, with a median age of 26 years. The intervention group needed significantly fewer attempts than the control group to reach proficiency in the second procedure: median (i.q.r.) 22 (17-34) versus 32 (26-41) attempts, which corresponded to 24.1 per cent fewer attempts as assessed by multivariable analysis (P = 0.004). The intervention group required significantly less time than the control group to reach proficiency: median (i.q.r.) 88 (63-127) versus 131 (101-153) min respectively, corresponding to a difference of 31.1 min as assessed by multivariable analysis (P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Practising two procedures, compared with only one, reduced the number of attempts and time to reach proficiency in the second procedure. Skills transfer is seen between two tasks in laparoscopic simulator training; however, task specificity is still present when practising procedures.

Evaluation of Procedural Simulation as a Training and Assessment Tool in General Surgery-Simulating a Laparoscopic Appendectomy,"Bjerrum, F.; Strandbygaard, J.; Rosthoj, S.; Grantcharov, T.; Ottesen, B.; Sorensen, J. L.","Background Laparoscopic appendectomy is a commonly performed surgical procedure, but few training models have been described for it. We examined a virtual reality module for practising a laparoscopic appendectomy. Methods A prospective cohort study with the following 3 groups of surgeons (n = 45): novices (0 procedures), intermediates (10-50 procedures), and experienced (>100 procedures). After being introduced to the simulator and 1 familiarization attempt on the procedural module, the participants practiced the module 20 times. Movements, task time, and procedure-specific parameters were compared over time. Results The time and movement parameters were significantly different during the first attempt, and more experienced surgeons used fewer movements and less time than novices (p < 0.01), although only 2 parameters were significantly different between novices and intermediates. All 3 groups improved significantly over 20 attempts (p < 0.0001). The intraclass correlation coefficient varied between 0.55 and 0.68 and did not differ significantly between the 3 groups (p > 0.05). When comparing novices with experienced surgeons, novices had a higher risk of burn damage to cecum (odds ratio [OR] = 3.0 [95% CI: 1.3; 7.0] p = 0.03), pressure damage to appendix (OR = 3.1 [95% CI: 2.0; 4.9] p < 0.0001), and grasping of the appendix (OR = 2.9 [95% CI: 1.8; 4.7] p < 0.0001). The risk of causing a perforation was not significantly different among the different experience levels (OR = 1.9 [95% CI: 0.9; 3.8] p = 0.14). Only 3 out of 5 error parameters differed significantly when comparing novices and experienced surgeons. Similarly, when comparing intermediates and novices, it was only 2 of the parameters that differed. Discussion The simulator module for practising laparoscopic appendectomy may be useful as a training tool, but further development is required before it can be used for assessment purposes. Procedural simulation may demonstrate more variation for movement parameters, and future research should focus on developing better procedure-specific parameters.

Randomized Trial of a Virtual Reality Tool to Teach Surgical Technique for Tibial Shaft Fracture Intramedullary Nailing,"Blumstein, G.; Zukotynski, B.; Cevallos, N.; Ishmael, C.; Zoller, S.; Burke, Z.; Clarkson, S.; Park, H.; Bernthal, N.; SooHoo, N. F.","Introduction: Active learning methods have accumulated popularity due to improved results in knowledge acquisition as opposed to passive learning methods. For surgical resident physicians with limited training opportunities outside of the operating room due to time constraints, virtual reality (VR) is a relatively inexpensive and time-efficient active training method for procurement of surgical skills. We conducted a simulated intramedullary nailing (IMN) of a tibia to demonstrate VR training programs as a more effective modality of learning orthopedic surgical techniques compared to passive learning tools such as a standard guide (SG) through trained novice medical students performing a SawBones simulation of intramedullary nail fixation. Material(s) and Method(s): First and second-year medical students without prior experience of procedure were recruited and randomized to SG or VR training. Participants were observed performing simulated tibia IMN procedure immediately after training and evaluated by a blinded attending surgeon using procedure-specific checklist and 5-point global assessment scale. Participants returned after 2-weeks for repeat training and evaluation. Result(s): 20 participants were recruited and randomized into VR (n = 10) and SG (n = 10) groups. All 20 participants completed the first phase and 17 completed the second phase of the study. Aggregate global assessment scores were significantly higher for VR than SG group (17.5 vs. 7.5, p < 0.001), including scores in all individual categories. The percentage of steps completed correctly was significantly higher in the VR group compared to the SG group (63% vs. 25%, p < 0.002). Average improvement between the first and second phases of the study were higher in the VR group compared to SG group across all 5-categories of the global assessment scale, and significantly higher for knowledge of instruments (50% vs. 11%, p, 0.01). Discussion(s): VR training was more effective than a passive SG in our model of simulated tibia IMN for novice medical students. Virtual reality training may be a useful method to augment orthopedic education.

Mixed-methods exploration of students' motivation in using augmented reality in neuroanatomy education with prosected specimens,"Bolek, K. A.; De Jong, G.; Van der Zee, C. E. E. M.; van Cappellen van Walsum, A. M.; Henssen, D. J. H. A.","The use of augmented reality (AR) in teaching and studying neuroanatomy has been well researched. Previous research showed that AR-based learning of neuroanatomy has both alleviated cognitive load and was attractive to young learners. However, how the attractiveness of AR effects student motivation has not been discovered. Therefore, the motivational effects of AR were investigated in this research by use of quantitative- and qualitative methods. Motivation elicited by the GreyMapp-AR, an AR application, was investigated in medical and biomedical sciences students (n = 222; mean age: 19.7 +/-1.4 years) using the Instructional Measure of Motivation Survey (IMMS). Additional components (i.e., attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction) were also evaluated with motivation as measured by IMMS. Additionally, 19 students underwent audio-recorded individual interviews which were transcribed for qualitative analysis. Males regarded the relevance of AR significantly higher than females (P < 0.024). Appreciation of the GreyMapp-AR program was found to be significantly higher in students studying biomedical sciences as compared to students studying medicine (P < 0.011). Other components and scores did not show significant differences between student groups. Students expressed that AR was beneficial in increasing their motivation to study subcortical structures, and that AR could be helpful and motivating for preparing an anatomy examination. This study suggests that students are motivated to study neuroanatomy by use of AR, although the components that make up their individual motivation can differ significantly between groups of students.

"DIVA, a 3D virtual reality platform, improves undergraduate craniofacial trauma education","Bouaoud, J.; El Beheiry, M.; Jablon, E.; Schouman, T.; Bertolus, C.; Picard, A.; Masson, J. B.; Khonsari, R. H.","Craniofacial fractures management is challenging to teach due to the complex anatomy of the head, even when using three-dimensional CT-scan images. DIVA is a software allowing the straightforward visualization of CT-scans in a user-friendly three-dimensional virtual reality environment. Here, we assess DIVA as an educational tool for craniofacial trauma for undergraduate medical students. Three craniofacial trauma cases (jaw fracture, naso-orbital-ethmoid complex fracture and Le Fort 3 fracture) were submitted to 50 undergraduate medical students, who had to provide diagnoses and treatment plans. Each student then filled an 8-item questionnaire assessing satisfaction, potential benefit, ease of use and tolerance. Additionally, 4 postgraduate students were requested to explore these cases and to place 6 anatomical landmarks on both virtual reality renderings and usual slice-based three-dimensional CT-scan visualizations. High degrees of satisfaction (98%) without specific tolerance issues (86%) were reported. The potential benefit in a better understanding of craniofacial trauma using virtual reality was reported by almost all students (98%). Virtual reality allowed a reliable localization of key anatomical landmarks when compared with standard three-dimensional CT-scan visualization. Virtual reality interfaces such DIVA are beneficial to medical students for a better understanding of craniofacial trauma and allow a reliable rendering of craniofacial anatomy.

Learning procedural skills with a virtual reality simulator: An acceptability study,"Bracq, M. S.; Michinov, E.; Arnaldi, B.; Caillaud, B.; Gibaud, B.; Gouranton, V.; Jannin, P.","BACKGROUND: Virtual Reality (VR) simulation has recently been developed and has improved surgical training. Most VR simulators focus on learning technical skills and few on procedural skills. Studies that evaluated VR simulators focused on feasibility, reliability or easiness of use, but few of them used a specific acceptability measurement tool. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of the study was to assess acceptability and usability of a new VR simulator for procedural skill training among scrub nurses, based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. PARTICIPANTS: The simulator training system was tested with a convenience sample of 16 non-expert users and 13 expert scrub nurses from the neurosurgery department of a French University Hospital. METHOD(S): The scenario was designed to train scrub nurses in the preparation of the instrumentation table for a craniotomy in the operating room (OR). RESULT(S): Acceptability of the VR simulator was demonstrated with no significant difference between expert scrub nurses and non-experts. There was no effect of age, gender or expertise. Workload, immersion and simulator sickness were also rated equally by all participants. Most participants stressed its pedagogical interest, fun and realism, but some of them also regretted its lack of visual comfort. CONCLUSION(S): This VR simulator designed to teach surgical procedures can be widely used as a tool in initial or vocational training. Copyright © 2019.

Training situational awareness for scrub nurses: Error recognition in a virtual operating room,"Bracq, M. S.; Michinov, E.; Le Duff, M.; Arnaldi, B.; Gouranton, V.; Jannin, P.","Virtual reality simulation provides interesting opportunities to train nurses in a safe environment. While the virtual operating room has proven to be a useful training tool for technical skills, it has been less studied for non-technical skills. This study aimed to assess ""Error recognition in a virtual operating room"", using a simulation scenario designed to improve situation awareness. Eighteen scrub-nurse students and 8 expert scrub-nurses took part in the experiment. They were immersed in a virtual operating room and reported any errors they observed. There were nineteen errors with various degrees of severity. Measures were retrieved from logs (number of errors, time for detection, movements) and from questionnaires (situation awareness, subjective workload, anxiety and user experience). The results showed that the participants who detected most errors had a higher level of situation awareness, detected high-risk errors faster and felt more immersed in the virtual operating room than those detecting fewer errors. They also felt the workload was lighter and experienced more satisfaction. Students explored the operating room more than experts did and detected more errors, especially those with moderate risk. Debriefings confirmed that virtual simulation is acceptable to trainees and motivates them. It also provides useful and original material for debriefings. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing Innovative Virtual Reality Simulations to Increase Health Care Providers' Understanding of Social Determinants of Health,"Brammer, S. V.; Regan, S. L.; Collins, C. M.; Gillespie, G. L.","INTRODUCTION: Health care providers (HCPs) who work primarily with Medicaid patients must be competent in identifying and addressing social determinants of health (SDH). A curricular gap exists between promoting an understanding of SDH and teaching HCPs how to recognize and increase empathy to manage them. The project aim was to develop two virtual reality simulations (VRSs) as innovative methods to teach HCPs to identify and manage SDH. A secondary aim was to decrease unconscious bias and increase empathy by experiencing SDH from their patients' perspective. METHOD(S): Scripts for two VRSs were created by two HCP educators and clinicians. Scripts were evaluated by experts using an index of content validity (CVI). An advisory panel critiqued the scripts for appropriateness for VRSs, adequacy of evidence-based practice, and use of VRS equipment and software. The panel participated in a focus group and completed a final evaluation. The VRSs then were pilot tested with five HCPs who assessed content and utility and participated in interviews. This led to iterative improvements. Qualitative data were analyzed using a content analysis approach. RESULT(S): The VRS scripts demonstrated adequate content-related validity evidence with CVI scores of 0.81 and 0.75. The expert panel found the VRS easy to use, useful as an educational tool, while promoting empathy for patients. Overall, participants were satisfied with using the VRS as an educational experience. DISCUSSION: Through VRS technology, this project addresses a curricular gap in HCP training on SDH. VRS can be a useful tool to increase HCPs' understanding of SDH and, potentially, their empathy for patients.

Simulation-based education for endoscopic third ventriculostomy: A comparison between virtual and physical training models,"Breimer, G. E.; Haji, F. A.; Bodani, V.; Cunningham, M. S.; Lopez-Rios, A. L.; Okrainec, A.; Drake, J. M.","BACKGROUND: The relative educational benefits of virtual reality (VR) and physical simulation models for endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) have not been evaluated ""head to head."" OBJECTIVE: To compare and identify the relative utility of a physical and VR ETV simulation model for use in neurosurgical training. METHOD(S): Twenty-three neurosurgical residents and 3 fellows performed an ETV on both a physical and VR simulation model. Trainees rated the models using 5-point Likert scales evaluating the domains of anatomy, instrument handling, procedural content, and the overall fidelity of the simulation. Paired t tests were performed for each domain's mean overall score and individual items. RESULT(S): The VR model has relative benefits compared with the physical model with respect to realistic representation of intraventricular anatomy at the foramen of Monro (4.5, standard deviation [SD] = 0.7 vs 4.1, SD = 0.6; P =.04) and the third ventricle floor (4.4, SD=0.6 vs 4.0, SD=0.9; P=.03), although the overall anatomy score was similar (4.2, SD = 0.6 vs 4.0, SD = 0.6; P =.11). For overall instrument handling and procedural content, the physical simulator outperformed the VR model (3.7, SD = 0.8 vs 4.5; SD = 0.5, P <.001 and 3.9; SD = 0.8 vs 4.2, SD = 0.6; P =.02, respectively). Overall task fidelity across the 2 simulators was not perceived as significantly different. CONCLUSION(S): Simulation model selection should be based on educational objectives. Training focused on learning anatomy or decision-making for anatomic cuesmay be aided with the VR simulationmodel. A focus on developing manual dexterity and technical skills using endoscopic equipment in the operating room may be better learned on the physical simulation model.

A virtual radiation therapy workflow training simulation,"Bridge, P.; Crowe, S. B.; Gibson, G.; Ellemor, N. J.; Hargrave, C.; Carmichael, M.","Aim: Simulation forms an increasingly vital component of clinical skills development in a wide range of professional disciplines. Simulation of clinical techniques and equipment is designed to better prepare students for placement by providing an opportunity to learn technical skills in a ""safe"" academic environment. In radiotherapy training over the last decade or so this has predominantly comprised treatment planning software and small ancillary equipment such as mould room apparatus. Recent virtual reality developments have dramatically changed this approach. Innovative new simulation applications and file processing and interrogation software have helped to fill in the gaps to provide a streamlined virtual workflow solution. This paper outlines the innovations that have enabled this, along with an evaluation of the impact on students and educators. Method(s): Virtual reality software and workflow applications have been developed to enable the following steps of radiation therapy to be simulated in an academic environment: CT scanning using a 3D virtual CT scanner simulation; batch CT duplication; treatment planning; 3D plan evaluation using a virtual linear accelerator; quantitative plan assessment, patient setup with lasers; and image guided radiotherapy software. Result(s): Evaluation of the impact of the virtual reality workflow system highlighted substantial time saving for academic staff as well as positive feedback from students relating to preparation for clinical placements. Students valued practice in the ""safe"" environment and the opportunity to understand the clinical workflow ahead of clinical department experience. Conclusion(s): Simulation of most of the radiation therapy workflow and tasks is feasible using a raft of virtual reality simulation applications and supporting software. Benefits of this approach include time-saving, embedding of a case-study based approach, increased student confidence, and optimal use of the clinical environment.

Box- or Virtual-Reality Trainer: Which Tool Results in Better Transfer of Laparoscopic Basic Skills?-A Prospective Randomized Trial,"Brinkmann, C.; Fritz, M.; Pankratius, U.; Bahde, R.; Neumann, P.; Schlueter, S.; Senninger, N.; Rijcken, E.","Objective Simulation training improves laparoscopic performance. Laparoscopic basic skills can be learned in simulators as box- or virtual-reality (VR) trainers. However, there is no clear recommendation for either box or VR trainers as the most appropriate tool for the transfer of acquired laparoscopic basic skills into a surgical procedure. Design Both training tools were compared, using validated and well-established curricula in the acquirement of basic skills, in a prospective randomized trial in a 5-day structured laparoscopic training course. Participants completed either a box- or VR-trainer curriculum and then applied the learned skills performing an ex situ laparoscopic cholecystectomy on a pig liver. The performance was recorded on video and evaluated offline by 4 blinded observers using the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) score. Learning curves of the various exercises included in the training course were compared and the improvement in each exercise was analyzed. Setting Surgical Skills Lab of the Department of General and Visceral Surgery, University Hospital Muenster. Participants Surgical novices without prior surgical experience (medical students, n = 36). Results Posttraining evaluation showed significant improvement compared with baseline in both groups, indicating acquisition of laparoscopic basic skills. Learning curves showed almost the same progression with no significant differences. In simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy, total GOALS score was significantly higher for the box-trained group than the VR-trained group (box: 15.31 +/- 3.61 vs. VR: 12.92 +/- 3.06; p = 0.039; Hedges g* = 0.699), indicating higher technical skill levels. Conclusions Despite both systems having advantages and disadvantages, they can both be used for simulation training for laparoscopic skills. In the setting with 2 structured, validated and almost identical curricula, the box-trained group appears to be superior in the better transfer of basic skills into an experimental but structured surgical procedure.

Battle of the bots: a comparison of the standard da Vinci and the da Vinci Surgical Skills Simulator in surgical skills acquisition,"Brown, K.; Mosley, N.; Tierney, J.","Virtual reality simulators are increasingly used to gain robotic surgical skills. This study compared use of the da Vinci Surgical Skills Simulator (dVSSS) to the standard da Vinci (SdV) robot for skills acquisition in a prospective randomized study. Residents from urology, gynecology, and general surgery programs performed three virtual reality tasks (thread the ring, ring rail, and tubes) on the dvSSS. Participants were then randomized to one of the two study groups (dVSSS and SdV). Each participant then practiced on either the dVSSS or the SdV (depending on randomization) for 30 min per week over a 4-week time period. The dVSSS arm was not permitted to practice ring rail (due to no similar practice scenario available for the SdV group). Following 4 weeks of practice, participants performed the same three virtual reality tasks and the results were recorded and compared to baseline. Overall and percent improvement were recorded for all participants from pre-test to post-test. Two-way ANOVA analyses were used to compare the dVSSS and SdV groups and three tasks. Initially, 30 participants were identified and enrolled in the study. Randomization resulted in 15 participants in each arm. During the course of the study, four participants were unable to complete all tasks and practice sessions and were, therefore, excluded. This resulted in a total of 26 participants (15 in the dVSSS group and 11 in the SdV group) who completed the study. Overall total improvement score was found to be 23.23 and 23.48 for the SdV and dVSSS groups, respectively (p = 0.9245). The percent improvement was 60 and 47 % for the SdV and dVSSS groups respectively, which was a statistically significant difference between the two groups and three tasks. Practicing on the standard da Vinci is comparable to practicing on the da Vinci simulator for acquiring robotic surgical skills. In spite of several potential advantages, the dVSSS arm performed no better than the SdV arm in the final assessment of participant scores. Our findings indicate that both the SdV and dVSSS can be beneficial to residents in improving their robotic surgery skills.",2017,1-Jun,Journal of Robotic Surgery,11(2),,159-162,619662744,,,#659,Brown 2017,,
Virtual Reality Training in Disaster Medicine: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"Brown, N.; Margus, C.; Hart, A.; Sarin, R.; Hertelendy, A.; Ciottone, G.","SUMMARY STATEMENT: Disaster medicine (DM) training aims to recreate stressful, mass casualty scenarios faced by medical professionals in the field with high fidelity. Virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are well suited to disaster training as it can provide a safe, socially distant simulation with a high degree of realism. The purpose of this literature review was to summarize the current use of VR or AR for simulation training of healthcare providers in DM education. A systematic review of peer-reviewed articles was performed from January 1, 2000, to November 21, 2020, on PubMed, Embase, and OVID. Exclusion criteria included non-English articles, computer-generated models without human participants, or articles not relating to DM, VR or AR. Thirty-two articles were included. Triage accuracy was evaluated in 17 studies. Participants reported improved confidence and positive satisfaction after the simulations. The studies suggest VR or AR can be considered for disaster training in addition to other, more traditional simulation methods. More research is needed to create a standardized educational model to incorporate VR and AR into DM training and to understand the relationship between disaster simulation and improved patient care.

National Implementation of Simulator Training Improves Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumours in Patients,"Bube, S. H.; Kingo, P. S.; Madsen, M. G.; Vasquez, J. L.; Norus, T.; Olsen, R. G.; Dahl, C.; Hansen, R. B.; Konge, L.; Azawi, N.","Background: Transurethral resection of bladder tumours (TURBT) is the initial diagnostic treatment for patients with bladder cancer. TURBT is not an easy procedure to master and simulator training may play a role in improving the learning curve. Objective(s): To implement a national training programme for simulation-based mastery learning in TURBT and explore operating theatre performance after training. Design, setting, and participants: From June 2019 to March 2021, 31 doctors at urology departments in Denmark performed two pretraining TURBT procedures on patients, followed by proficiency-based mastery learning on a virtual reality simulator and then two post-training TURBTs on patients. Outcome measurements and statistical analyses: Operating theatre performances were video-recorded and assessed by two independent, blinded raters using the Objective Structured Assessment for Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumours Skills (OSATURBS) assessment tool. Paired-sample t tests were used to compare pretraining and post-training analyses and independent t tests for between-group comparisons. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03864302. Results and limitations: Before training, novices had significantly lower performance scores in comparison to those with intermediate experience (p = 0.017) and experienced doctors (p < 0.001). After training, novices significantly improved their clinical performance score (from 11.4 to 17.1; p = 0.049, n = 10). Those with intermediate experience and experienced doctors did not benefit significantly from simulator training (p = 0.9 and p = 0.8, respectively). Conclusion(s): Novices improved their TURBT performance in the operating theatre after completing a proficiency-based training programme on a virtual reality simulator. Patient Summary: We trained surgeons in an operation to remove bladder tumours using a virtual reality simulator. Novice doctors improved their performance significantly after the training, but the training effects for more experienced doctors were minimal. Therefore, we suggest the introduction of mandatory simulator training in the residency programme for urologists.

Observing the stages of bystander intervention in virtual reality simulation,"Buckler, D. G.; Alfredo, A.; Snobelen, P.; Abella, B. S.; Blewer, A.; Leary, M.","BACKGROUND: Understanding bystander reactions to an emergency is an important component of effective training. Four stages of bystander intervention (BI) have been previously described: noticing the situation as a problem, interpreting when it is appropriate to intervene, recognizing personal responsibility to intervene, and knowing how to intervene. Using virtual reality (VR) to simulate emergencies such as sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) can be used to study these stages. METHOD(S): In a secondary analysis of an observational cohort study, we analyzed bystander self-efficacy for stages of BI before and after simulated SCA. Each subject participated in a single-player, immersive, VR SCA scenario. Subjects interacted with simulated bystanders through voice commands (""call 911"", ""get an AED""). Actions taken in scenario, like performing CPR, were documented. Scenario BI actions were compared based on dichotomized comfort/discomfort. RESULT(S): From June 2016 to June 2017, 119 subjects participated. Average age was 37+/-14 years, 44% were female and 46% reported CPR training within 2 years. During the scenario, 98% ""noticed the event"" and ""interpreted it as a problem"", 78% ""took responsibility"", and 54% ""possessed the necessary skills"". Self-efficacy increased from pre- to post-scenario: noticing the event increased from 80% to 96%; interpreting as a problem increased from 86% to 97%; taking responsibility increased from 56% to 93%; possessing necessary skills increased from 47% to 63% (P<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Self-efficacy to respond to an SCA event increased pre- to post-scenario. Bystanders who reported feeling comfortable ""taking responsibility to intervene"" during an emergency were more likely to take action during a simulated emergency.

3D virtual reality vs. 2D desktop registration user interface comparison,"Bueckle, A.; Buehling, K.; Shih, P. C.; Borner, K.","Working with organs and extracted tissue blocks is an essential task in many medical surgery and anatomy environments. In order to prepare specimens from human donors for further analysis, wet-bench workers must properly dissect human tissue and collect metadata for downstream analysis, including information about the spatial origin of tissue. The Registration User Interface (RUI) was developed to allow stakeholders in the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) to register tissue blocks-i.e., to record the size, position, and orientation of human tissue data with regard to reference organs. The RUI has been used by tissue mapping centers across the HuBMAP consortium to register a total of 45 kidney, spleen, and colon tissue blocks, with planned support for 17 organs in the near future. In this paper, we compare three setups for registering one 3D tissue block object to another 3D reference organ (target) object. The first setup is a 2D Desktop implementation featuring a traditional screen, mouse, and keyboard interface. The remaining setups are both virtual reality (VR) versions of the RUI: VR Tabletop, where users sit at a physical desk which is replicated in virtual space; VR Standup, where users stand upright while performing their tasks. All three setups were implemented using the Unity game engine. We then ran a user study for these three setups involving 42 human subjects completing 14 increasingly difficult and then 30 identical tasks in sequence and reporting position accuracy, rotation accuracy, completion time, and satisfaction. All study materials were made available in support of future study replication, alongside videos documenting our setups. We found that while VR Tabletop and VR Standup users are about three times as fast and about a third more accurate in terms of rotation than 2D Desktop users (for the sequence of 30 identical tasks), there are no significant differences between the three setups for position accuracy when normalized by the height of the virtual kidney across setups. When extrapolating from the 2D Desktop setup with a 113-mm-tall kidney, the absolute performance values for the 2D Desktop version (22.6 seconds per task, 5.88 degrees rotation, and 1.32mmposition accuracy after 8.3 tasks in the series of 30 identical tasks) confirm that the 2D Desktop interface is well-suited for allowing users in HuBMAP to register tissue blocks at a speed and accuracy that meets the needs of experts performing tissue dissection. In addition, the 2D Desktop setup is cheaper, easier to learn, and more practical for wet-bench environments than the VR setups. Copyright © 2021 Bueckle et al.

Virtual Reality Simulated Learning Environments: A Strategy To Teach Interprofessional Students About Social Determinants Of Health,"Buitron de la Vega, P.; Dimitri, N.; Araujo Brinkerhoff, C.; Stern, A.; Damus, K.; Miselis, H.; Garg, P. S.; Sarfaty, S.; Sprague Martinez, L.","PURPOSE: Physician assistants (PAs) and medical degree students (MDs) often lack training in addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH). Social workers (SWs), meanwhile, have extensive SDOH training; however, few medical professionals have opportunities to engage in interprofessional training with social workers. This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and students' perceptions of an interprofessional virtual reality (VR) simulated learning environment (SLE) for teaching health professions students about the SDOH. METHOD(S): In January 2020, 15 students at Boston University School of Medicine attended web-based video conferences focused on SDOH, health equity, and team-based care. Subsequently, student dyads participated in a case-based learning activity using an immersive VR SLE to develop teamwork skills. Evaluation included a postsurvey and a focus group examining their experiences in the course to gauge feasibility and acceptability. Thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses from the postsurvey and focus group data was conducted. RESULT(S): A total of 8 VR simulations were run. Findings indicated both MD and PA students learned patient engagement strategies from SW students, who enhanced their health care leadership capacity. Participants found the means of instruction acceptable, valued the hands-on VR interprofessional training, and expressed interest in learning more about the scope of one another's roles and the community resources available to patients. CONCLUSION(S): VR SLE is a feasible and acceptable means of instruction. It allowed students to connect across programmatic and geographic boundaries in a collaborative working environment mimicking the team approach to care they will use in their professional life. This experience illustrated for students the strengths a multidisciplinary team has to offer.

Evaluation of vaccination training in pharmacy curriculum: Preparing students for workforce needs,"Bushell, M.; Frost, J.; Deeks, L.; Kosari, S.; Hussain, Z.; Naunton, M.","Background: To introduce and evaluate a university vaccination training program, preparing final year Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) and Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) students to administer vaccinations to children and adults in community pharmacy and offsite (mobile and outreach) settings. Method(s): Final year BPharm and MPharm students were trained to administer intramuscular vaccinations to adults and children. The education program embedded in pharmacy degree curriculum was congruent with the requirements of the Australian National Immunisation Education Framework. The training used a mix of pedagogies including online learning; interactive lectures; and simulation, which included augmented reality and role play. All pharmacy students completing the program in 2019 were required to carry out pre- and post-knowledge assessments. Student skill of vaccination was assessed using an objective structured clinical assessment rubric. Students were invited to complete pre and post questionnaires on confidence. The post questionnaire incorporated student evaluation of learning experience questions. Result(s): In both cohorts, student vaccination knowledge increased significantly after the completion of the vaccination training program; pre-intervention and post-intervention mean knowledge score (SD) of BPharm and MPharm were (14.3 +/- 2.7 vs. 22.7 +/- 3.3; p < 0.001) and (15.7 +/- 2.9 vs. 21.4 +/- 3.2; p < 0.001) respectively. There was no difference between the BPharm and MPharm in the overall knowledge test scores, (p = 0.81; p = 0.95) pre and post scores respectively. Using the OSCA rubric, all students (n = 52) were identified as competent in the skill of injection and could administer an IM deltoid injection to a child and adult mannequin. Students agreed that the training increased their self-confidence to administer injections to both children and adults. Students found value in the use of mixed reality to enhance student understanding of the anatomy of injection sites. Conclusion(s): The developed vaccination training program improved both student knowledge and confidence. Pharmacy students who complete such training should be able to administer vaccinations to children and adults, improving workforce capability. Mixed reality in the education of pharmacy students can be used to improve student satisfaction and enhance learning.

Assessing the value of endoscopy simulator modules designed to prepare residents for the fundamentals of endoscopic surgery examination,"Byrne, R. M.; Hoops, H. E.; Herzig, D. O.; Diamond, S. J.; Lu, K. C.; Brasel, K. J.; Tsikitis, V. L.","BACKGROUND: The Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery examination is required for all general surgery residents. The test modules are not available for practice before the examination; however, similar modules are commercially available. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to determine which modules are most valuable for resident training and preparation for the examination by evaluating which correlates best with experience level. DESIGN: This was a single-institution study. SETTING: A virtual reality endoscopy simulator was utilized. PARTICIPANTS: General surgery residents and faculty endoscopists performed endoscopy simulator modules (Endobasket 2, Endobubble 1 and 2, Mucosal Evaluation 2, and Basic Navigation) designed to prepare residents for the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery examination. Residents were assigned into junior and senior groups based on the completion of a dedicated endoscopy rotation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were the mean time to completion, mean number of balloons popped, and mean number of wall hits for the 3 groups. RESULT(S): A total of 21 junior residents, 11 senior residents, and 3 faculty participated. There were significant differences among groups in the mean time to completion for the Endobasket, Endobubble, and Mucosal Evaluation modules. The modules that correlated best with experience level were Endobubble 2 and Mucosal Evaluation 2. For Endobubble 2, juniors were slower than seniors, who were in turn slower than faculty (junior 118.8 +/- 20.55 seconds, senior 100.3 +/- 11.78 seconds, faculty 87.67 +/- 2.848 seconds; p < 0.01). Juniors popped fewer balloons than seniors, who popped fewer balloons than faculty (junior 9.441 +/- 3.838, senior 15.62 +/- 4.133, faculty 28.78 +/- 1.712; p < 0.001). For Mucosal Evaluation 2, juniors were slower than seniors, who were in turn slower than faculty (junior 468.8 +/- 123.5 seconds, senior 368.6 +/- 63.42 seconds, faculty 233.1 +/- 70.45 seconds; p < 0.01). LIMITATIONS: Study residents have not completed the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery examinations, so correlation with examination performance is not yet possible. CONCLUSION(S): Performance on Endobasket, Endobubble, and Mucosal Evaluation correlated well with experience level, providing benchmarks for each level to attain in preparation for the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery examination.

"Effectiveness of three-dimensional printed and virtual reality models in learning the morphology of craniovertebral junction deformities: A multicentre, randomised controlled study","Cai, S.; He, Y.; Cui, H.; Zhou, X.; Zhou, D.; Wang, F.; Tian, Y.","Objectives To compare the effectiveness of three-dimensional printed (3DP), virtual reality (VR) and conventional normal physical (NP) models in clinical education regarding the morphology of craniovertebral junction (CVJ) deformities. Design Prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled study. Setting Three teaching hospitals in China. Participants One hundred and fifty-three participants in their first year of a 3-year medical residency programme. Interventions All participants were randomised to one of the three groups to learn the morphology of CVJ deformities using 3DP, VR or NP models. Primary outcome measures The objective outcomes were evaluated using three-level objective testing. In the first-level test, the participants were required to identify 15 anatomical landmarks on radiographs without CVJ deformities. In the second-level test, all participants were asked to identify the same 15 landmarks on radiographs showing classic CVJ deformities. In the third-level test, the participants were required to describe the key features of three classic cases of CVJ deformities depicted on radiographs. Each participant was also asked to answer four subjective questions to evaluate the importance and usefulness of the educational materials. Results In the first-level test, the 3DP, VR and NP groups achieved similar correct rates. In the second-level test, the correct rate was higher in the 3DP group (82.1%+/-13.6%) than the VR and NP groups (76.9%+/-16.9% and 69.9%+/-20.0%, p=0.002). In the third-level test, the 3DP group achieved better correct rates regarding the description of key CVJ deformities features (66.2%+/-20.0%, p=0.049) than the other groups. The subjective tests showed that the 3DP model method was considered the most valuable approach for learning CVJ deformities. Conclusions The objective and subjective results show that the 3DP model is more effective teaching instrument than the NP model for learning the pathomorphology of CVJ deformities. The VR model also showed great efficacy, second to 3DP model, in improving participants' understanding of CVJ deformities. Copyright © 2020 Massachussetts Medical Society.

Improving resident performance in knee arthroscopy: A prospective value assessment of simulators and cadaveric skills laboratories,"Camp, C. L.; Krych, A. J.; Stuart, M. J.; Regnier, T. D.; Mills, K. M.; Turner, N. S.","Background: Cadaveric skills laboratories and virtual reality simulators are two common methods used outside of the operating room to improve residents' performance of knee arthroscopy. We are not aware of any head-to-head comparisons of the educational values of these two methodologies. The purpose of this prospective randomized trial was to assess the efficacy of these training methods, compare their rates of improvement, and provide economic value data to programs seeking to implement such technologies. Method(s): Orthopaedic surgery residents were randomized to one of three groups: control, training on cadavera (cadaver group), and training with use of a simulator (simulator group). Residents completed pretest and posttest diagnostic knee arthroscopies on cadavera that were timed and video-recorded. Between the pretest and posttest, the control group performed no arthroscopy, the cadaver group performed four hours of practice on cadavera, and the simulator group trained for four hours on a simulator. All tests were scored in a blinded, randomized fashion using the validated Arthroscopy Surgical Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET). The mean improvement in the ASSET score and in the time to complete the procedure were compared between the pretest and posttest and among the groups. Result(s): Forty-five residents (fifteen per group) completed the study. The mean difference in the ASSET score from the pretest to the posttest was 20.40 (p = 0.776) in the control group, 14.27 (p = 0.002) in the cadaver group, and 11.92 (p = 0.096) in the simulator group (p = 0.015 for the comparison among the groups). The mean difference in the testcompletion time (minutes:seconds) from the pretest to the posttest was 0:07 (p = 0.902) in the control group, 3:01 (p = 0.002) in the cadaver group, and 0:28 (p = 0.708) in the simulator group (p = 0.044 for the comparison among groups). Residents in the cadaver group improved their performance at a mean of 1.1 ASSET points per hour spent training whereas those in the simulator group improved 0.5 ASSET point per hour of training. Conclusion(s): Cadaveric skills laboratories improved residents' performance of knee arthroscopy compared with that of matched controls. Residents practicing on cadaveric specimens improved twice as fast as those utilizing a high-fidelity simulator; however, based on cost estimation specific to our institution, the simulator may be more cost-effective if it is used at least 300 hours per year. Additional study of this possibility is warranted.

"Increasing awareness, sensitivity, and empathy for Alzheimer's dementia patients using simulation","Campbell, D.; Lugger, S.; Sigler, G. S.; Turkelson, C.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a type of dementia that interferes with memory, thinking, and behavior is the most common type of dementia. As a result, it is a leading contributor to death and disability for those over the age of 65. Therefore, future nurses must have the knowledge and skills to manage patients with AD in any setting spanning the healthcare continuum. OBJECTIVE(S): The goal of this project was to evaluate perceptions of awareness, knowledge and sensitivity of future nurses concerning AD patients before and after participation in a simulated virtual reality dementia experience. DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: A quasi-experimental repeated measure pre-post design was used with a convenience sample of 163 undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students from three different courses at large public university in the Midwest. METHOD(S): Students were placed in teams of four to participate in a 45-minute interactive simulated virtual reality dementia experience. Each session started with a 15-minute team pre-briefing session, followed by a 10-minute individual simulation, which was then followed by a 30-minute team debriefing session facilitated by faculty using the Plus/ Delta debriefing technique. The Dementia Attitudes Scale (DAS), The Knowledge About Memory Loss and Care Test (KAML-C), and the Healthcare Tour Survey were administered pre/post participation. Qualitative data was also collected from student reflections. RESULT(S): Statistically significant changes (p < 0.001) were noted in the pre/post DAS survey and the Healthcare Tour Survey. No significant change was noted on the KAML-C, although there was a trend towards improvement. No differences were noted between courses on any of the surveys. CONCLUSION(S): Using a virtual reality dementia experience proved to be a valuable strategy to increase student perceptions of awareness, knowledge, and sensitivity of AD. Further exploration is warranted to establish how these may be further facilitated to translate into improved care for those with AD. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Using virtual simulation to teach evidence-based practice in nursing curricula: A rapid review,"Cant, R.; Cooper, S.; Ryan, C.","BACKGROUND: Virtual simulation is an interactive teaching and learning strategy used in undergraduate nursing student education, especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Few published studies have reviewed the impact of virtual simulation as a strategy for teaching nursing students the elements of evidence-based practice. AIM: To describe types of virtual simulation that are relevant to nursing student education and examine how these modalities are applied to teach elements of evidence-based practice. METHOD(S): A rapid review of literature was conducted to discern the use and impact of virtual simulation. Thirty-seven studies published between 2017 and May 2021 that addressed nursing students' educational outcomes were reviewed and summarized as a narrative analysis. RESULT(S): Virtual simulation and virtual reality simulation engage learners in role-plays via a computer screen or hand-held phone. Various levels of realism and immersion were apparent across different modalities and with the utilization of educational games. Most studies related to the teaching of best practice evidence-based clinical nursing topics. Twenty primary studies reported objective measures of students' improvement such as knowledge, performance, better documentation, or communication accuracy. Sixteen studies that measured knowledge identified significant knowledge gains. All studies endorsed virtual simulation as a teaching method. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Virtual simulation approaches offer an innovative and feasible option for teaching nursing students. Such approaches should be included in undergraduate nursing curricula. While it is apparent that evidence-based practice guidelines inform the design of the virtual simulation scenarios, the effectiveness of the modality for teaching specific elements of evidence-based practice to nursing students is not yet confirmed. Nursing curricula need to include ways of teaching nursing students to search for and critically appraise trustworthy sources of knowledge for clinical practice.

"Virtual simulation studies in nursing education: A bibliometric analysis of the top 100 cited studies, 2021","Cant, R.; Ryan, C.; Kardong-Edgren, S.","OBJECTIVES: Bibliometrics is an emerging science in nursing. Quantitative methods were used to conduct a bibliometric analysis of highly cited virtual simulation nursing education articles to describe rank order, breadth of topics and authorship patterns. DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: A desktop analysis of publication performance was conducted using the Scopus database as the source of article citation data. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The top 100 cited articles clustered over 14-years, 2008 to 2021. Citations per paper ranged from 88 to a low of 3 (median 18, mean 22.1) and in the top 10 studies, from 88 to 41. The citation trajectory was moderately correlated with article maturity (r = -.384, p <=0.001). Article citations in subsequent publications commenced the first year after publication and three-year-old papers reached the mean citation rate of 22. Nurse Education Today was the most cited journal. There was no significant impact of article type (72% primary research, 17% literature reviews, 11% descriptive papers) (p = 0.755). International representation was strong, as first authors in 21 countries were cited - many (43%) from USA. One highly cited author (M. Verkuyl) from Canada led six papers, with six other authors each leading two studies. Virtual simulation modalities included virtual simulation, virtual reality simulation, 3D virtual reality simulation, virtual games and virtual worlds. The top 10 articles offer a diverse resource for faculty and educators who wish to consider using virtual simulation. CONCLUSION(S): Virtual simulation studies in nursing education cover an emerging field of research that has relatively low citation rates. Nursing researchers and faculty need to understand the usefulness and limitations of bibliometric analysis as this methodology can make a unique contribution to research, policy, and funding decisions, and enable productivity assessments of faculty staff and departments.

Objective(s): This study aims to map the existing evidence and identify gaps and research priorities to enable robust and relevant research in digital health professions education. Method(s): We searched for systematic reviews on the digital education of practicing and student health care professionals. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Educational Research Information Center, CINAHL, and gray literature sources from January 2014 to July 2020. A total of 2 authors independently screened the studies, extracted the data, and synthesized the findings. We outlined the key characteristics of the included reviews, the quality of the evidence they synthesized, and recommendations for future research. We mapped the empirical findings and research recommendations against the newly developed conceptual framework. Result(s): We identified 77 eligible systematic reviews. All of them included experimental studies and evaluated the effectiveness of digital education interventions in different health care disciplines or different digital education modalities. Most reviews included studies on various digital education modalities (22/77, 29%), virtual reality (19/77, 25%), and online education (10/77, 13%). Most reviews focused on health professions education in general (36/77, 47%), surgery (13/77, 17%), and nursing (11/77, 14%). The reviews mainly assessed participants' skills (51/77, 66%) and knowledge (49/77, 64%) and included data from high-income countries (53/77, 69%). Our novel conceptual framework of digital health professions education comprises 6 key domains (context, infrastructure, education, learners, research, and quality improvement) and 16 subdomains. Finally, we identified 61 unique questions for future research in these reviews; these mapped to framework domains of education (29/61, 47% recommendations), context (17/61, 28% recommendations), infrastructure (9/61, 15% recommendations), learners (3/61, 5% recommendations), and research (3/61, 5% recommendations). Conclusion(s): We identified a large number of research questions regarding digital education, which collectively reflect a diverse and comprehensive research agenda. Our conceptual framework will help educators and researchers plan, develop, and study digital education. More evidence from low- and middle-income countries is needed.

Transfer of virtual reality endoscopy training to live animal colonoscopy: a randomized control trial of proficiency vs. repetition-based training,"Cassidy, D. J.; Coe, T. M.; Jogerst, K. M.; McKinley, S. K.; Sell, N. M.; Sampson, M.; Park, Y. S.; Petrusa, E.; Goldstone, R. N.; Hashimoto, D. A.; Gee, D. W.","Background: Low first-time pass rates of the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery (FES) exam stimulated development of virtual reality (VR) simulation curricula for test preparation. This study evaluates the transfer of VR endoscopy training to live porcine endoscopy performance and compares the relative effectiveness of a proficiency-based vs repetition-based VR training curriculum. Method(s): Novice endoscopists completed pretesting including the FES manual skills examination and Global Assessment of GI Endoscopic Skills (GAGES) assessment of porcine upper and lower endoscopy. Participants were randomly assigned one of two curricula: proficiency-based or repetition-based. Following curriculum completion, participants post-tested via repeat FES examination and GAGES porcine endoscopy assessments. The two cohorts pre-to-post-test differences were compared using ANCOVA. Result(s): Twenty-two residents completed the curricula. There were no differences in demographics or clinical endoscopy experience between the groups. The repetition group spent significantly more time on the simulator (repetition: 242.2 min, SD 48.6) compared to the proficiency group (proficiency: 170.0 min, SD 66.3; p = 0.013). There was a significant improvement in porcine endoscopy (pre: 10.6, SD 2.8, post: 16.6, SD 3.4; p < 0.001) and colonoscopy (pre: 10.4, SD 2.7, post: 16.4, SD 4.2; p < 0.001) GAGES scores as well as FES manual skills performance (pre: 270.9, SD 105.5, post: 477.4, SD 68.9; p < 0.001) for the total cohort. There was no difference in post-test GAGES performance or FES manual skills exam performance between the two groups. Both the proficiency and repetition group had a 100% pass rate on the FES skills exam following VR curriculum completion. Conclusion(s): A VR endoscopy curriculum translates to improved performance in upper and lower endoscopy in a live animal model. VR curricula type did not affect FES manual skills examination or live colonoscopy outcomes; however, a proficiency curriculum is less time-consuming and can provide a structured approach to prepare for both the FES exam and clinical endoscopy.

L.; Azzola, A.; Cassina, T.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) simulation is an effective and safe method of teaching bronchoscopic skills. Few VR bronchoscopy simulators exist; all are expensive. The present study aimed to describe the design, development, and evaluation of a new, affordable, VR bronchoscopy simulator. METHOD(S): Anesthesiologists and engineers collaborated to design and develop the Computer Airway Simulation System (CASS), an iPad-based, high-fidelity, VR bronchoscopy simulator. We describe hardware and software development, as well as the technical and teaching features of the CASS. Twenty-two senior anesthesiologists evaluated various aspects of the simulator (using a 5-point Likert scale) to assess its face validity. RESULT(S): Anesthesiologists performed a simulated bronchoscopy (mouth to carina) with a median (range) procedural time of 66 seconds (30-96). The simulator's ease of use was rated 4.3 +/- 0.8 and the bronchoscope proxy's handling 4.0 +/- 0.7. Criticisms included that excessive system reactivity created handling difficulties. Anatomical accuracy, 3-dimensional bronchial segmentation, and mucosal texture were judged to be very realistic. The simulator's usefulness for teaching and its educational value were highly rated (4.9 +/- 0.3 and 4.8 +/- 0.4, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): We describe the design, development, and initial evaluation of the CASS - a new, ultraportable, affordable, VR bronchoscopy simulator. The simulator's face validity was supported by excellent assessments from senior anesthesiologists with regard to anatomical realism, quality of graphics, and handling performance, even though some future refinements are required.

Method(s): The overall methodology included first obtaining an understanding of the LISS plating process through interactions with expert orthopedic surgeons and developing the information centric models. The information centric models provided a structured basis to design and build the simulator. Subsequently, the haptic-based simulator was built. Finally, the learning assessments were conducted in a medical school. Result(s): The results from the learning assessments confirm the effectiveness of the VSE for teaching medical residents and students. The scope of the assessment was to ensure (1) the correctness and (2) the usefulness of the VSE. Out of 37 residents/students who participated in the test, 32 showed improvements in their understanding of the LISS plating surgical process. A majority of participants were satisfied with the use of teaching Avatars and haptic technology. A paired t test was conducted to test the statistical significance of the assessment data which showed that the data were statistically significant. Conclusion(s): This paper demonstrates the usefulness of adopting information centric modeling approach in the design and development of the simulator. The assessment results underscore the potential of using VR-based simulators in medical education especially in orthopedic surgery.

Portable Endoscopic Simulator for Urological Training: A Face/Content and Construct Validity Study,"Cepek, J.; Wilson, C.; Denstedt, J. D.; Stern, N.; Razvi, H.; Bjazevic, J.; Dave, S.; Wang, P.","Mastering a surgical skill requires experience and repetition, yet opportunities for surgical trainees to gain real experience is variable and limited by case load. Surgical simulators have emerged in an attempt to overcome these limitations. However, the few currently available skills simulators for flexible endoscopy are costly, have limited accessibility and versatility, lack portability, and require dedicated time for practice. The use of a portable skills simulator to teach flexible endoscopy may provide a feasible alternative. This study introduces a novel, low-cost, portable, endoscopic simulation system for training basic endoscopic skills. Using custom software, the simulator presents a virtual environment featuring 3D models of anatomy, endoscopes, and endoscopic tools. The virtual endoscope and its tools are directly controlled in the simulation by motion input from a custom-manufactured portable endoscopic controller that communicates data via a Bluetooth interface. This two-part study presents proof of concept and initial pilot data examining the face/content validity and preliminary construct validity of the portable endoscopic simulator. In part one, experts (n = 2) and novices (n = 6) provided ratings of fidelity and utility as a training tool. In part two, experts (n = 4) and novices (n = 4) completed 10 simulated sequential basic endoscopic tasks and time to completion was assessed. Findings indicate that the simulator has good utility as a training tool, but some features require modification to be more realistic. Further, both novices and experts improved on the task with repeated measurements (p < .001), but there were no significant differences between experts and novices in time to completion. Although more robust validation is required, this simulator appears promising as a feasible and cost-effective tool for providing simulation training on basic endoscopic skills.",2022,,Journal of endourology.,11,,,637983145,,,#823,Cepek 2022,,
"AEducaAR, Anatomical Education in Augmented Reality: A Pilot Experience of an Innovative Educational Tool Combining AR Technology and 3D Printing","Cercenelli, L.; De Stefano, A.; Billi, A. M.; Ruggeri, A.; Marcelli, E.; Marchetti, C.; Manzoli, L.; Ratti, S.; Badiali, G.","Gross anatomy knowledge is an essential element for medical students in their education, and nowadays, cadaver-based instruction represents the main instructional tool able to provide three-dimensional (3D) and topographical comprehensions. The aim of the study was to develop and test a prototype of an innovative tool for medical education in human anatomy based on the combination of augmented reality (AR) technology and a tangible 3D printed model that can be explored and manipulated by trainees, thus favoring a three-dimensional and topographical learning approach. After development of the tool, called AEducaAR (Anatomical Education with Augmented Reality), it was tested and evaluated by 62 second-year degree medical students attending the human anatomy course at the International School of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bologna. Students were divided into two groups: AEducaAR-based learning (""AEducaAR group"") was compared to standard learning using human anatomy atlas (""Control group""). Both groups performed an objective test and an anonymous questionnaire. In the objective test, the results showed no significant difference between the two learning methods; instead, in the questionnaire, students showed enthusiasm and interest for the new tool and highlighted its training potentiality in open-ended comments. Therefore, the presented AEducaAR tool, once implemented, may contribute to enhancing students' motivation for learning, increasing long-term memory retention and 3D comprehension of anatomical structures. Moreover, this new tool might help medical students to approach to innovative medical devices and technologies useful in their future careers. Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

The Utility of Virtual Reality in Orthopedic Surgical Training,"Cevallos, N.; Zukotynski, B.; Greig, D.; Silva, M.; Thompson, R. M.","Objective: To examine the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) to prepare surgical trainees for a pediatric orthopedic surgery procedure: pinning of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Design(s): Participants were randomly assigned to a standard, study guide (SG) group or to a VR training group. All participants were provided a technique video and SG; the VR group additionally trained via an Osso VR surgical trainer (ossovr.com) with real-time feedback and coaching from an attending pediatric orthopedic surgeon. Following training, participants performed a SCFE guidewire placement on a SawBones model embedded in a soft-tissue envelope (SawBones model 1161). Participants were asked to achieve ""ideal placement"" based on the training provided. Participants were evaluated on time, number of pin ""in-and outs,"" penetration of the articular surface, angle between the pin and the physis, distance from pin tip to subchondral bone and distance from the center-center point of the epiphysis. Setting(s): Orthopedic Institute for Children, Los Angeles, CA. Participant(s): Twenty fourth-year medical students, first- and second-year orthopedic residents without experience with the SCFE procedure. Result(s):: Twenty participants were randomized to SG (n = 10) or VR (n = 10). Average time to final pin placement was 19% shorter in VR group (706 vs 573 seconds, p = 0.26). When compared to SG, the VR group had, on average, 70% less pin in-and-outs (1.7 vs 0.5, p = 0.28), 50% less articular surface penetrations (0.4 vs 0.2, p = 0.36), and 18% smaller distance from pin tip to subchondral bone on lateral view (7.1 vs 5.8 mm, p = 0.42). Moreover, the VR group had a lower average angle deviation between pin and line perpendicular to the physis on coronal view (4.9degree vs 2.5degree, p < 0.05). Conclusion(s):: VR training is potentially more effective than traditional preparatory methods. This pilot study suggests that VR training may be a viable surgical training tool, which may alleviate constraints of time, money, and safety concerns with resultant broad applicability for surgical education.

The Impact of Virtual Reality Exposure on Stress Level and Sense of Competence in Ambulance Workers,"Chaabane, S.; Etienne, A. M.; Schyns, M.; Wagener, A.","Virtual reality (VR) exposure is used in clinical psychology to treat anxiety disorders. It is also used to enhance resilience in soldiers by allowing them to confront virtual combat environments to help fortify them against the negative consequences of trauma exposure. Most VR studies have focused on military and emergency medical staff; however, thus far, none have investigated VR in ambulance workers (AWs), who are confronted with traumatic situations daily. The current study aimed to assess the impact of a single VR exposure session on self-perceived competence and stress level in a sample of AWs. Participants (N = 40) were randomly assigned to either a VR immersion (i.e., experimental group, n = 20) or an audio immersion (i.e., control group, n = 20) of a shooting attack situation. We hypothesized that compared to controls, VR participants would report decreased anxiety, as measured using visual analog scales, as well as an increased sense of competence. The results showed a significant reduction in fear in both groups, d = 0.33, and an increased sense of competence in VR participants, d = 0.35. Although our hypotheses were only partially confirmed, the observed beneficial effects of VR and the audio immersion on stress levels in AWs suggest that VR exposure could be a useful way to increase resilience in AWs.

Virtual reality teaching in chemotherapy administration: Randomised controlled trial,"Chan, H. Y.; Chang, H. C.; Huang, T. W.","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of virtual reality (VR)-based documents (VRdocs) on knowledge and attitude towards chemotherapy administration in nursing students. BACKGROUND: Chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer patients are a complicated and dangerous process. However, despite the high toxicity of the chemotherapeutic drugs, the compulsory or internship courses in nursing schools do not include training in operational chemotherapeutics and its associated safety measures. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial based on the CONSORT 2010 guidelines (registry number: NCT03707210). METHOD(S): A total of 77 students were randomised to an experimental (VRdocs, n = 38) or a control group (n = 39). Pre- and posttest data were collected. After the pretest, the control group received the education documents, whereas, the experimental group used VR software consisting of an application about chemotherapy administration. Finally, the effectiveness of the intervention was self-evaluated using questionnaires after 7 days. RESULT(S): The posttest scores for knowledge (F = 6.412, p = .013) and attitude in the experimental group were significantly different from those in the control group (F = 8.469, p = .005). Compared with the control group, a significant number of students in the experimental group indicated their higher recommendation score for the VRdocs (p = .0001). CONCLUSION(S): Schools must provide a variety of handouts and teaching methods to educate nursing students about high-risk nursing techniques. Methods using VR can address the shortcomings of the traditional documents, and the use of both methods simultaneously can produce better learning results. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Virtual reality based documents were provided to the participants to understand the preparation, implementation, and safety of chemotherapy. VRdocs allow students to re-learn high-risk care techniques without the influence of time and space and may prove useful for other nursing courses.

Global rating scales and motion analysis are valid proficiency metrics in virtual and benchtop knee arthroscopy simulators,"Chang, J.; Banaszek, D. C.; Gambrel, J.; Bardana, D.","Background Work-hour restrictions and fatigue management strategies in surgical training programs continue to evolve in an effort to improve the learning environment and promote safer patient care. In response, training programs must reevaluate how various teaching modalities such as simulation can augment the development of surgical competence in trainees. For surgical simulators to be most useful, it is important to determine whether surgical proficiency can be reliably differentiated using them. To our knowledge, performance on both virtual and benchtop arthroscopy simulators has not been concurrently assessed in the same subjects. Questions/purposes (1) Do global rating scales and procedure time differentiate arthroscopic expertise in virtual and benchtop knee models? (2) Can commercially available built-in motion analysis metrics differentiate arthroscopic expertise? (3) How well are performance measures on virtual and benchtop simulators correlated? (4) Are these metrics sensitive enough to differentiate by year of training? Methods A cross-sectional study of 19 subjects (four medical students, 12 residents, and three staff) were recruited and divided into 11 novice arthroscopists (student to Postgraduate Year [PGY] 3) and eight proficient arthroscopists (PGY 4 to staff) who completed a diagnostic arthroscopy and loose-body retrieval in both virtual and benchtop knee models. Global rating scales (GRS), procedure times, and motion analysis metrics were used to evaluate performance. Results The proficient group scored higher on virtual (14 +/- 6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 10-18] versus 36 +/- 5 [95% CI, 32-40], p < 0.001) and benchtop (16 +/- 8 [95% CI, 11-21] versus 36 +/- 5 [95% CI, 31-40], p < 0.001) GRS scales. The proficient subjects completed nearly all tasks faster than novice subjects, including the virtual scope (579 +/-169 [95% CI, 466-692] versus 358 +/- 178 [95% CI, 210-507] seconds, p = 0.02) and benchtop knee scope + probe (480 +/- 160 [95% CI, 373-588] versus 277 +/- 64 [95% CI, 224-330] seconds, p = 0.002). The built-in motion analysis metrics also distinguished novices from proficient arthroscopists using the self-generated virtual loose body retrieval task scores (4 +/- 1 [95% CI, 3-5] versus 6 +/- 1 [95% CI, 5-7], p = 0.001). GRS scores between virtual and benchtop models were very strongly correlated (q = 0.93, p < 0.001). There was strong correlation between year of training and virtual GRS (q = 0.8, p < 0.001) and benchtop GRS (q = 0.87, p < 0.001) scores. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate performance on both virtual and benchtop knee simulators. We have shown that subjective GRS scores and objective motion analysis metrics and procedure time are valid measures to distinguish arthroscopic skill on both virtual and benchtop modalities. Performance on both modalities is well correlated. We believe that training on artificial models allows acquisition of skills in a safe environment. Future work should compare different modalities in the efficiency of skill acquisition, retention, and transferability to the operating room.

Comparisons of Stress Physiology of Providers in Real-Life Resuscitations and Virtual Reality-Simulated Resuscitations,"Chang, T. P.; Beshay, Y.; Hollinger, T.; Sherman, J. M.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is a promising simulation medium for high-stakes, low-frequency events such as pediatric resuscitation. The psychological fidelity of VR compared with a real resuscitation in an emergency department (ED) is relatively unknown. The objective was to determine whether stress physiology changes were equivalent between ED and VR resuscitations. METHOD(S): This was a single-site pilot equivalence study evaluating head-mounted VR resuscitation scenarios using board-certified/eligible pediatric ED physicians. Subjects had heart rates (HRs) and salivary cortisol levels recorded throughout 8-hour evening ED shifts and during one 1-hour VR session. Additional samples and subjective workload perception (NASA Task Load Index) were collected for critical resuscitations. A delta HR and delta cortisol level described the difference in mean HR and mean cortisol level between shifts with and shifts without resuscitations. Another delta calculation was performed from pre-VR to post-VR. Nonparametric univariate statistics was examined for significant differences in delta HR or cortisol levels between the ED setting and VR. RESULT(S): Sixteen subjects had 69 shifts monitored with 31 resuscitations. In the ED, delta HR was +13.9 bpm (P < 0.001) and delta cortisol was +0.10 mug/dL (P = 0.006). In VR, delta HR was +6.5 bpm (P < 0.001) but minimal delta cortisol (-0.02 mug/dL, P = 0.05). Emergency department resuscitations both HR and cortisol levels were more than VR resuscitations (P < 0.03). NASA Task Load Index scores were higher in VR resuscitations with +26 score difference (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION(S): Virtual reality resuscitations increase HR but show less stress physiology changes than ED resuscitations within an actual 8-hour shift.

Development and Considerations for Virtual Reality Simulations for Resuscitation Training and Stress Inoculation,"Chang, T. P.; Hollinger, T.; Dolby, T.; Sherman, J. M.","INTRODUCTION: Resuscitation simulations immerse learners into the complexity of emergency patient management. Head-Mounted Display Virtual Reality (VR) has been used for stress inoculation therapy for phobias and posttraumatic stress disorder. However, VR for stress inoculation in resuscitation leadership training has not been studied. We sought to develop VR simulation for stress inoculation, as exposure therapy training, for resuscitations. METHOD(S): We explain the conceptual design, development, production, and initial evaluation process for 2 VR simulations in infant status epilepticus and pediatric anaphylactic shock. We further describe deliberate game mechanic choices to maximize psychological fidelity. In-virtual reality performance data for time-to-critical actions and stress physiology markers (heart rate, salivary cortisol) were collected from expert pediatric emergency physicians and novice pediatric residents. Data were analyzed to examine differences between the 2 groups for both outcome types to determine the extent of stress response or performance deficit the VR induced. RESULT(S): Multiple difficulties and distractions were designed for the 2 scenarios; we evaluated the highest difficulty and environmental distraction versions. Between 19 expert physicians and 15 novice physicians, no performance differences were found in typical airway, breathing, and circulation actions. Residents preferred more lorazepam first-line antiepileptics than attendings (P = 0.003) and performed a cricothyrotomy later than attendings (P = 0.02). Residents, however, manifested higher salivary cortisol levels than attendings (+0.07 mug/dL, 95% confidence interval = 0.03-0.12, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): A VR resuscitation simulation manifested expected stress physiology changes in physicians. Further evaluation is needed to determine the effect of VR simulation as longitudinal stress inoculation for healthcare providers.

Exploring the experiences of nursing students in using immersive virtual reality to learn nursing skills,"Chang, Y. M.; Lai, C. L.","BACKGROUND: In recent years, virtual reality teaching applications exhibited exponential development in numerous fields. An increasing number of virtual reality application cases and modules have been developed in the nursing education field to verify their effectiveness. OBJECTIVE(S): The research objective is to understand the experience of nursing students in using virtual reality skill learning process. DESIGN: This study is a qualitative research that adopts focus group research methods. The participants were able to freely describe their subjective feelings toward the virtual reality skill learning process. PARTICIPANTS/SETTINGS: This research was conducted in a nursing school in Taiwan. Purposive sampling was adopted to select 60 nursing students who participated in the Adult Nursing and Practice course. The participants were divided into six focus groups containing 10 participants each. METHOD(S): Aside from learning with traditional practice equipment, the students also experienced the virtual reality nasogastric tube care skill learning system. Focus group interviews were held from March 25 to 27, 2019. During the interview, we inquired about the students' subjective feelings toward the virtual reality skill learning system and reflected on its influence on the students' learning process. RESULT(S): An analysis of the focus group interview content of 60 students, revealed that the students' experience toward the virtual reality skill learning process could be classified into five themes, namely ""convenient to practice, but requires adaptation,"" ""fast skill learning process,"" ""stress-free learning environment,"" ""environmentally friendly,"" and ""lacks a sense of reality."" CONCLUSION(S): Instead of replacing conventional skill teaching methods, future applications of the virtual reality nursing skill education support system shall serve as a student self-learning supporting tool. Additionally, the research and development of the virtual reality nursing skill education support system should focus on its stereognosis aspect and include an interactive function to upgrade the system into a practical teaching and learning support material.

The effects of an immersive 3d interactive video program on improving student nurses' nursing skill competence: A randomized controlled trial study,"Chao, Y. C.; Hu, S. H.; Chiu, H. Y.; Huang, P. H.; Tsai, H. T.; Chuang, Y. H.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acquired accurate clinical nursing skills are among the most important core nursing competencies for nursing students, as nursing students' inadequate skill capacities might endanger patients safety. Therefore, it is essential to develop teaching strategies to strengthen students' nursing skills. This study examined the effects of an immersive three-dimensional (3D) interactive video program on improving nursing students' nasogastric tube feeding skill competence. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial research design. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five nursing students from a university in northern Taiwan. METHOD(S): The students were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 22) and a comparison group (n = 23). The intervention group received the immersive 3D interactive video program on nasogastric tube feeding, whereas the comparison group watched a regular demonstration video. The questionnaire was used to collect data before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and one month after the intervention. RESULT(S): Nursing students' knowledge and confidence in nasogastric tube feeding were significantly improved after the intervention in both groups. Although there were no significant differences in students' knowledge, skill, and confidence between the two groups, participants' average satisfaction score with the immersive 3D interactive video program in the intervention group was significantly higher than in the comparison group that watched a regular video (t = 2.302, p = 0.026). CONCLUSION(S): The findings of this study showed that both immersive 3D interactive video program and regular demonstration video could improve nursing students' learning outcomes. The higher satisfaction score in the intervention group indicates that learning through immersive 3D interactive video is acceptable and satisfactory.

Validation of a Virtual Reality Simulator for Percutaneous Pedicle Screw Insertion,"Charalambou, A.; Segaren, N.; Haldar, A.; Vaghela, K. R.; Aftab, S.; Montgomery, A.; Akhtar, K.; Lee, J. K.","INTRODUCTION: Working-hour restrictions, rota gaps and an increasing drive for theatre efficiency have resulted in challenges to surgical training. As a result, Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a popular tool to augment this training. Our aim was to evaluate the validity of a VR simulator for performing percutaneous pedicle screw guidewire insertion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four participants were divided into three equal groups depending on prior surgical experience: a novice group (<10 procedures), an intermediate group (10-50 procedures) and an expert group (>50 procedures). All subjects performed four guidewire insertions on a TraumaVision simulator (Swemac Innovation AB, Linkoping, Sweden) in a set order. Six outcome measures were recorded; total score, time, fluoroscopy exposure, wire depth, zone of placement and wall violations. RESULT(S): There were statistically significant differences between the groups for time taken (p<0.001) and fluoroscopy exposure (p<0.001). The novice group performed the worst, and the expert group outperformed both intermediates and novices in both categories. Other outcome results were good and less variable. There was an observed learning effect in the novice and intermediate groups between each of the attempts for both time taken and fluoroscopy exposure. CONCLUSION(S): The study contributes constructive evidence to support the validity of the TraumaVision simulator as a training tool for pedicle screw guidewire insertion. The simulator is less suitable as an assessment tool. The learning effect was evident in the less experienced groups, suggesting that VR may offer a greater benefit in the early stages of training.

Can virtual reality improve traditional anatomy education programmes? A mixed-methods study on the use of a 3D skull model,"Chen, S.; Zhu, J.; Cheng, C.; Pan, Z.; Liu, L.; Du, J.; Shen, X.; Shen, Z.; Zhu, H.; Liu, J.; Yang, H.; Ma, C.; Pan, H.","BACKGROUND: Realistic, portable, and scalable lectures, cadaveric models, 2D atlases and computer simulations are being combined more frequently for teaching anatomy, which result in major increases in user satisfaction. However, although digital simulations may be more portable, interesting, or motivating than traditional teaching tools, whether they are superior in terms of student learning remain unclear. This paper presents a study in which the educational effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR) skull model is compared with that of cadaveric skulls and atlases. The aim of this study was to compare the results of teaching with VR to results of teaching with traditional teaching methods by administering objective questionnaires and perception surveys. METHOD(S): A mixed-methods study with 73 medical students was conducted with three different groups, namely, the VR group (N=25), cadaver group (N=25) and atlas group (N=23). Anatomical structures were taught through an introductory lecture and model-based learning. All students completed the pre- and post-intervention tests, which comprised a theory test and an identification test. The theory test consisted of 18 multiple-choice questions, and the identification test consisted of 25 fill-in-the-blank questions. RESULT(S): The participants in all three groups had significantly higher total scores on the post-intervention test than on the pre-intervention test; the post-intervention test score in the VR group was not statistically significantly higher than the post-intervention test score of the other groups (VR: 30 [IQR: 22-33.5], cadaver: 26 [IQR: 20-31.5], atlas: 28[IQR: 20-33]; p>0.05).

Curriculum setting and students' feedback of pre-clinical training in different dental schools in China-A national-wide survey,"Chen, Y.; Deng, J.; Li, B.; Yang, Y.; He, Z.; Ye, L.; Zhang, L.; Ren, Q.; Zheng, Q.","INTRODUCTION: Adequate time and effective training facilities are essential for undergraduate dental students participating in pre-clinical dental practice to ensure them providing safe treatment for patients in the future. The study aimed to explore the current status of pre-clinical dental training in China in relation to the curriculum setting and students' feedback of pre-clinical training in different dental schools and thus provide information for further standardise curricula. MATERIALS AND METHOD: An online questionnaire was distributed electronically to undergraduates in 44 Chinese dental schools of different levels according to China Discipline Ranking (CDR). The questionnaire collected information in relation to the training hour and student to facility ratio of four main dental courses (cariology and endodontics, periodontology, prosthodontics and oral surgery), as well as the application and effect of virtual reality (VR) simulator in pre-clinical dental practice in different schools. Students' feedback was also collected. RESULT(S): A total of 565 valid questionnaires were recruited. Results of this cross-sectional survey show that training hour of periodontology course was the lowest, and oral surgery course showed most prominent shortage of facilities. The application of VR simulator amongst schools is uneven. Students from A and A+ level schools showed higher satisfaction with their pre-clinical courses and reported a more positive attitude towards the use of VR simulator than other students. (p < .05).

Method(s): Between January 2018 and January 2020, 60 healthcare providers, including physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, were enrolled. For the intervention, a newly developed head-mounted display (HMD) and web VR materials were implemented in training and clinical services. Subsequently, in-hospital healthcare providers were trained using either text or headmounted display virtual reality (HMD-VR) materials in the regular and intervention modules, respectively. For tracheostomy care skills, preceptors directly audited the performance of trainees and provided feedback. Result(s): At baseline, the degree of trainees' agreement with the self-efficacy-related statements, including the aspects of familiarity, confidence, and anxiety about tracheostomy-related knowledge and care skills, were not different between the control and intervention groups. At follow-up stage, compared with the regular group, a higher percentage of intervention group' trainees reported that they are ""strongly agree""or ""somewhat agree""that the HMD-VR simulation increases their self-efficacy, including the aspects of familiarity and confidence, and reduced their anxiety about tracheostomy-related knowledge and care skills. After implementation, a higher degree of trainees' average satisfaction with VR-based training and VR materials was observed in the intervention group than in the regular group. Most reported that VR materials enabled accurate messaging and decreased anxiety. The increasing trend of the average written test and hands-on tracheostomy care skills scores among the intervention group trainees was significant compared to those in the regular group. The benefits of HMD-VR simulations and web-VR material-based clinical services for in-hospital healthcare providers and patient families persisted until 3 to 4weeks later. Conclusion(s): The current study suggests that VR materials significantly enhance trainees' self-efficacy (increased familiarity, increased confidence, and reduced anxiety) and their satisfaction with the training, while motivating them to use acquired knowledge and skills in clinical practice.

Gender differences in the acquisition of suturing skills with the da Vinci surgical system,"Chiu, H. Y.; Kang, Y. N.; Wang, W. L.; Tong, Y. S.; Chang, S. W.; Fong, T. H.; Wei, P. L.","Background: The percentage of female medical students has been significant elevating worldwide. The demographic shift is expected to influence the proportion of male versus female surgeons soon. The objective of this study was to evaluate the gender differences in the acquisition of robotic suturing skills. Method(s): We compared the robotic suturing performance between 39 male and 19 female medical students. We separated the training into two parts: phase I, involving virtual reality (VR) robotic simulation, and phase II, involving robotic dry-laboratory simulation training. Participants first conducted step-by-step exercises on the VR robotic simulator and then the robotic skin-suturing pad using the da Vinci robot. Result(s): The metric analysis of the VR task ""suture sponge"" showed that female students required less time (difference: -170.7 seconds, 95% CI: -247.4 to -94.0) and had fewer errors (error difference: -50, 95% CI: -74.2 to -25.8) to complete the suture sponge exercise compared to male students. Moreover, female students completed more stitches than male students (differences in mean stitch achieved:. 35; 95% CI:. 06 to. 65). However, there was no difference in the quality scores of stitches by gender (p = 0.85). Conclusion(s): Female medical students performed better in the VR task of suture spongy and achieved more stitches than male students with the da Vinci system despite no difference in robotic suture quality by gender. Because this is the first study comparing gender performance on a robotic platform, further studies are required to investigate if different training approaches will affect the performance by gender.

"Virtual Reality Glasses and ""Eye-Hands Blind Technique"" for Microsurgical Training in Neurosurgery","Choque-Velasquez, J.; Colasanti, R.; Collan, J.; Kinnunen, R.; Rezai Jahromi, B.; Hernesniemi, J.","Objective: Microsurgical skills and eye-hand coordination need continuous training to be developed and refined. However, well-equipped microsurgical laboratories are not so widespread as their setup is expensive. Herein, we present a novel microsurgical training system that requires a high-resolution personal computer screen, smartphones, and virtual reality glasses. Method(s): A smartphone placed on a holder at a height of about 15-20 cm from the surgical target field is used as the webcam of the computer. A specific software is used to duplicate the video camera image. The video may be transferred from the computer to another smartphone, which may be connected to virtual reality glasses. Result(s): Using the previously described training model, we progressively performed more and more complex microsurgical exercises. It did not take long to set up our system, thus saving time for the training sessions. Conclusion(s): Our proposed training model may represent an affordable and efficient system to improve eye-hand coordination and dexterity in using not only the operating microscope but also endoscopes and exoscopes.

Effects of Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation on Neurosurgical Skill Acquisition: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Ciechanski, P.; Cheng, A.; Lopushinsky, S.; Hecker, K.; Gan, L. S.; Lang, S.; Zareinia, K.; Kirton, A.","Background Recent changes in surgical training environments may have limited opportunities for trainees to gain proficiency in skill. Complex skills such as neurosurgery require extended periods of training. Methods to enhance surgical training are required to overcome duty-hour restrictions, to ensure the acquisition of skill proficiency. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) can enhance motor skill learning, but is untested in surgical procedural training. We aimed to determine the effects of tDCS on simulation-based neurosurgical skill acquisition. Methods Medical students were trained to acquire tumor resection skills using a virtual reality neurosurgical simulator. The primary outcome of change in tumor resection was scored at baseline, over 8 repetitions, post-training, and again at 6 weeks. Participants received anodal tDCS or sham over the primary motor cortex. Secondary outcomes included changes in brain resected, resection effectiveness, duration of excessive forces (EF) applied, and resection efficiency. Additional outcomes included tDCS tolerability. Results Twenty-two students consented to participate, with no dropouts over the course of the trial. Participants receiving tDCS intervention increased the amount of tumor resected, increased the effectiveness of resection, reduced the duration of EF applied, and improved resection efficiency. Little or no decay was observed at 6 weeks in both groups. No adverse events were documented, and sensation severity did not differ between stimulation groups. Conclusions The addition of tDCS to neurosurgical training may enhance skill acquisition in a simulation-based environment. Trials of additional skills in high-skill residents, and translation to nonsimulated performance are needed to determine the potential utility of tDCS in surgical training.

Feasibility of virtual reality behavior skills training for preservice clinicians,"Clay, C. J.; Schmitz, B. A.; Balakrishnan, B.; Hopfenblatt, J. P.; Evans, A.; Kahng, S.","Effective training procedures include behavioral skills training (BST), which involves providing written and verbal instructions, modeling of the skill, rehearsal of the skill, and feedback on the performance. This training typically involves in vivo experience in which trainees and students are exposed to risks such as proximity to infectious disease, behavioral issues such as aggression, and errors in teaching performance. Conducting BST in a virtual reality (VR) context involving virtual individuals with problem behavior may be an effective means of mitigating these risks. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of training students to conduct functional communication training (FCT) in a VR environment using BST. We trained 13 preservice college students to implement FCT for attention and escape functions. We found VR BST was effective at increasing correct steps performed of FCT to mastery criterion levels with all participants. Future researchers should examine generalization and maintenance of VR BST.

The role of mixed reality simulation for surgical training in spine: Phase 1 validation,"Coelho, G.; Defino, H. L. A.","Study Design. This study shows the first phase of validation of a new model for realistic training on spine surgery, conducted from January 2014 to November 2015. Objective. To propose and validate a new tool for neurosurgical education, associating virtual and realistic simulation (mixed reality), for spine surgery. Summary of Background Data. Surgical simulation is a relatively new filed that has a lot to offer to neurosurgical education. Training a new surgeon may take years of hands-on procedures, increasing the risk to patient's safety. The development of surgical simulation platforms is therefore essential to reducing the risk of potentially serious risks and improving outcome. Methods. Sixteen experienced spinal surgeons evaluated these simulators and answered the questionnaire regarding the simulation as a beneficial education tool. They evaluated the simulators in regard to dissection by planes, identification of pathology (lumbar canal stenosis), instrumentation and simulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and the relevant aspects of the computerized tomography (CT) imaging. Results. The virtual and physical simulators for spine surgery were approved by an expert surgery team, and considered adequate for educational purposes. The proportion of the answers was estimated by the confidence intervals. Conclusion. The surgery team considered that this virtual simulation provides a highly effective training environment, and it significantly enhances teaching of surgical anatomy and operative strategies in the neurosurgical field. A mixture of physical and virtual simulation provided the desired results of enhancing the requisite psychomotor and cognitive skills, previously acquired only during a surgical apprenticeship. The combination of these tools may potentially improve and abbreviate the learning curve for trainees, in a safe environment. Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Development and Evaluation of Pediatric Mixed-Reality Model for Neuroendoscopic Surgical Training,"Coelho, G.; Figueiredo, E. G.; Rabelo, N. N.; Rodrigues de Souza, M.; Fagundes, C. F.; Teixeira, M. J.; Zanon, N.","Objective: Neurosurgical training requires several years of supervised procedures and represents a long and challenging process. The development of surgical simulation platforms is essential to reducing the risk of potentially intraoperative severe errors arising from inexperience. To present and perform a phase I validation process of a mixed reality simulation (realistic and virtual simulators combined) for neuroendoscopic surgical training. Method(s): Tridimensional videos were developed by the 3DS Max program. Physical simulators were made with a synthetic thermoretractile and thermosensible rubber, which, when combined with different polymers, produces >30 different textures that simulate consistencies and mechanical resistance of human tissues. Questionnaires regarding the role of virtual and realistic simulators were applied to experienced neurosurgeons to assess the applicability of the mixed-reality simulation for neuroendoscopic surgical training. Result(s): The model was considered as a potential tool for training new residents in neuroendoscopic surgery. It was also adequate for practical application with inexperienced surgeons. According to the overall score, 83% of the surgeons believed that the realistic physical simulator presents distortions when compared with the real anatomic structure, afterwards the model improved 66% tridimensional reconstruction and 66% reported that the virtual simulator allowed a multiangular perspective ability. Conclusion(s): This model provides a highly effective way of working with 3-dimensional data and significantly enhances the learning of surgical anatomy and operative strategies. The combination of virtual and realistic tools may safely improve and abbreviate the surgical learning curve.

Development and evaluation of a new pediatric mixed-reality model for neurosurgical training,"Coelho, G.; Figueiredo, E. G.; Rabelo, N. N.; Teixeira, M. J.; Zanon, N.","OBJECTIVE Craniosynostosis is a premature cranial suture junction and requires a craniectomy to decrease cranial compression and remodel the affected areas of the skull. However, mastering these neurosurgical procedures requires many years of supervised training. The use of surgical simulation can reduce the risk of intraoperative error. The authors propose a new instrument for neurosurgical education, which mixes reality with virtual and realistic simulation for repair of craniosynostosis (scaphocephaly type). METHODS This study tested reality simulators with a synthetic thermo-retractile/thermosensitive rubber joined with different polymers. To validate the model, 18 experienced surgeons participated in this study using 3D videos developed using 3DS Max software. Renier's ""H"" technique for craniosynostosis correction was applied during the simulation. All participants completed questionnaires to evaluate the simulator. RESULTS An expert surgical team approved the craniosynostosis reality and virtual simulators. More than 94% of participants found the simulator relevant, considering aspects such as weight, surgical positioning, dissection by planes, and cranial reconstruction. The consistency and material resistance were also approved on average by more than 60% of the surgeons. CONCLUSIONS The virtual simulator demands a high degree of effectiveness with 3D perception in anatomy and operative strategies in neurosurgical training. Physical and virtual simulation with mixed reality required psychomotor and cognitive abilities otherwise acquired only during practical surgical training with supervision.

Trauma Bay Virtual Reality - A Game Changer for ATLS Instruction and Assessment,"Colonna, A. L.; Robbins, R.; Stefanucci, J.; Creem-Regeh, S.; Patterson, B.; Engel, B. T.; Fischer, A.; Nirula, R.","BACKGROUND: Medical educational research highlights the need for high-fidelity, multidisciplinary simulation training to teach complex decision-making skills such as those taught in ATLS. This approach is, however, expensive and time intensive. Virtual reality (VR) education simulation may improve skill acquisition in a cost-effective and time-sensitive manner. We developed a novel trauma VR simulator (TVRSim) for providers to apply ATLS principles. We hypothesized in this pilot study that TVRSim could differentiate practitioner competency with increasing experience and would be well accepted. METHOD(S): Providers at a level 1 trauma center (acute care surgeons, novice (MS4 & PGY1), junior (PGY2 & 3), senior (PGY4-6) residents) ran a blunt, polytrauma VR code. Ten critical decision points were assessed: intubation, cricothyroidotomy, chest tube, IV access, FAST, pelvic binder, activation of MTP, administration of hypertonic saline (HTS), hyperventilation and decision to go to the OR. Learner assessment was based upon frequency and time to correct decisions. Participant satisfaction was measured using validated surveys. RESULT(S): All 31 providers intubated and obtained IV access. Novices and juniors frequently failed at HTS and hyperventilation decisions. Juniors often failed at cricothyroidotomy (60%), and OR (100%) decisions. Mean time to all decisions except going to the OR was longer for all groups compared to ACS surgeons. Mean number of decisions/min was significantly higher for surgeons and seniors compared to juniors and novices. Mortality was 92.3% for novices, 80% for juniors, 25% for seniors and 0% for the attendings. Participants found TVRSim comfortable, easy to use/interact with/performance enhancing, and helped develop skills and learning. CONCLUSION(S): In this pilot study using a sample of convenience, TVRSim was able to discern decision-making abilities among trainees with increasing experience. All trainees felt the platform enhanced their performance and facilitated skill acquisition and learning. TVRSim could be a useful adjunct to teach and assess ATLS skills.

Assessment of a virtual reality temporal bone surgical simulator: A national face and content validity study,"Compton, E. C.; Agrawal, S. K.; Ladak, H. M.; Chan, S.; Hoy, M.; Nakoneshny, S. C.; Siegel, L.; Dort, J. C.; Lui, J. T.","Background: Trainees in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery must gain proficiency in a variety of challenging temporal bone surgical techniques. Traditional teaching has relied on the use of cadavers; however, this method is resource-intensive and does not allow for repeated practice. Virtual reality surgical training is a growing field that is increasingly being adopted in Otolaryngology. CardinalSim is a virtual reality temporal bone surgical simulator that offers a high-quality, inexpensive adjunct to traditional teaching methods. The objective of this study was to establish the face and content validity of CardinalSim through a national study. Method(s): Otolaryngologists and resident trainees from across Canada were recruited to evaluate CardinalSim. Ethics approval and informed consent was obtained. A face and content validity questionnaire with questions categorized into 13 domains was distributed to participants following simulator use. Descriptive statistics were used to describe questionnaire results, and either Chi-square or Fishers exact tests were used to compare responses between junior residents, senior residents, and practising surgeons. Result(s): Sixty-two participants from thirteen different Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery programs were included in the study (32 practicing surgeons; 30 resident trainees). Face validity was achieved for 5 out of 7 domains, while content validity was achieved for 5 out of 6 domains. Significant differences between groups (p-value of < 0.05) were found for one face validity domain (realistic ergonomics, p = 0.002) and two content validity domains (teaching drilling technique, p = 0.011 and overall teaching utility, p = 0.006). The assessment scores, global rating scores, and overall attitudes towards CardinalSim, were universally positive. Open-ended questions identified limitations of the simulator.

Development of a virtual reality clinically oriented temporal bone anatomy module with randomised control study of three-dimensional display technology,"Copson, B.; Wijewickrema, S.; Sorace, L.; Jones, R.; O'Leary, S.","Objective To investigate the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR), three-dimensional (3D) clinically orientated temporal bone anatomy module, including an assessment of different display technologies. Methods A clinically orientated, procedural and interactive anatomy module was generated from a micro-CT of a cadaveric temporal bone. The module was given in three different display technologies; 2D, 3D with monoscopic vision, and 3D with stereoscopic vision. A randomised control trial assessed the knowledge acquisition and attitudes of 47 medical students though a pretutorial and post-tutorial questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions identifying anatomic structures as well as understanding structural relations and clinical relevance. Furthermore, a five-point Likert scale assessed the students' attitudes to the module and alternative learning outcomes, such as interest in otology and preparedness for clinical rotations. Results As a whole cohort, the total test score improved significantly, with a large effect size (p<=0.005, Cohen's d=1.41). The 23 students who returned the retention questionnaire had a significant improvement in total test score compared with their pretutorial score, with a large effect size (p<=0.005, Cohen's d=0.83). Display technology did not influence the majority of learning outcomes, with the exception of 3D technologies, showing a significantly improvement in understanding of clinical relevance and structural relations (p=0.034). Students preferred 3D technologies for ease of use, perceived effectiveness and willingness to use again. Conclusions The developed VR temporal bone anatomy tutor was an effective self-directed education tool. 3D technology remains valuable in facilitating spatial learning and superior user satisfaction.

Virtual Reality vs Dry Laboratory Models: Comparing Automated Performance Metrics and Cognitive Workload during Robotic Simulation Training,"Cowan, A.; Chen, J.; Mingo, S.; Reddy, S. S.; Ma, R.; Marshall, S.; Nguyen, J. H.; Hung, A. J.","Background: This study compares surgical performance during analogous vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA) tasks in two robotic training environments, virtual reality (VR) and dry laboratory (DL), to investigate transferability of skill assessment across the two platforms. Utilizing computer-generated performance metrics and pupillary data, we evaluated the two environments to distinguish surgical expertise and ultimately whether performance in the VR simulation correlates with performance in live robotic surgery in the DL. Material(s) and Method(s): Experts (>=300 cases) and trainees (<300 cases) performed analogous VUAs during VR and DL sessions on a da Vinci robotic console following an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol (HS-16-00318). Twenty-two metrics were generated in each environment (kinematic metrics, tissue metrics, and biometrics). The DL included 18 previously validated automated performance metrics (APMs) (kinematics and event metrics) captured by an Intuitive system data recorder. In both settings, Tobii Pro Glasses 2 recorded the task-evoked pupillary response (reported as Index of Cognitive Activity [ICA]) to indicate cognitive workload, analyzed by EyeTracking cognitive workload software. Pearson correlation, Mann-Whitney, and independent t-tests were used for the comparative analyses. Result(s): Our study included six experts (median caseload 1300 [interquartile range 400-3000]) and 11 trainees (25 [0-250]). A total of 8/9 metrics directly comparable between VR and DL showed significant positive correlation (r >= 0.554, p <= 0.032); 5/22 VR metrics distinguished expertise, including task time (p = 0.031), clutch usage (p = 0.040), unnecessary needle piercing (p = 0.026), and suspected injury to the endopelvic fascia (p = 0.040). This contrasts with 14/22 APMs in DL (p <= 0.038), including linear velocities of all three instruments (p <= 0.038) and dominant-hand instrument wrist articulation (p = 0.013). Trainees experienced higher cognitive workload (ICA) in both environments when compared with experts (p < 0.036). Conclusion(s): Most performance metrics between VR and DL exhibited moderate to strong correlations, showing transferability of skills across the platforms.

This study explored the utility of virtual reality (VR) as a platform to provide the engaging elements of TBL, without students needing to be physically present in the same room. Educational Activity and Setting: Volunteers participated in a modified TBL exercise in VR, followed by a survey of the experience. The survey included Likert-type questions to evaluate the level of immersion and perceived engagement, comfort and desirability of VR-TBL experiences. Findings and discussion: The majority of the responses to the 14-question survey were 'agree' or 'strongly agree'. Ninety-four percent (94.4%) of participants strongly agreed that this was a fun experience, and 94.4% of participants strongly agreed that they would take a course in this format if it was offered. Although none of the questions received a majority of 'disagree' or 'strongly disagree' responses, areas for improvement included ease of use of the technology, comfort and improving the learning activity.

Development of an evidence-based training program for laparoscopic hysterectomy on a virtual reality simulator,"Crochet, P.; Aggarwal, R.; Knight, S.; Berdah, S.; Boubli, L.; Agostini, A.","Background: Substantial evidence in the scientific literature supports the use of simulation for surgical education. However, curricula lack for complex laparoscopic procedures in gynecology. The objective was to evaluate the validity of a program that reproduces key specific components of a laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) procedure until colpotomy on a virtual reality (VR) simulator and to develop an evidence-based and stepwise training curriculum. Method(s): This prospective cohort study was conducted in a Marseille teaching hospital. Forty participants were enrolled and were divided into experienced (senior surgeons who had performed more than 100 LH; n = 8), intermediate (surgical trainees who had performed 2-10 LH; n = 8) and inexperienced (n = 24) groups. Baselines were assessed on a validated basic task. Participants were tested for the LH procedure on a high-fidelity VR simulator. Validity evidence was proposed as the ability to differentiate between the three levels of experience. Inexperienced subjects performed ten repetitions for learning curve analysis. Proficiency measures were based on experienced surgeons' performances. Outcome measures were simulator-derived metrics and Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scores. Result(s): Quantitative analysis found significant inter-group differences between experienced intermediate and inexperienced groups for time (1369, 2385 and 3370 s; p < 0.001), number of movements (2033, 3195 and 4056; p = 0.001), path length (3390, 4526 and 5749 cm; p = 0.002), idle time (357, 654 and 747 s; p = 0.001), respect for tissue (24, 40 and 84; p = 0.01) and number of bladder injuries (0.13, 0 and 4.27; p < 0.001).

R.; Ganesh, R.; Ghosh, K.; Bauer, B. A.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the safety and use of a nature-based virtual reality (VR) experience among health care providers (HCP) during a pandemic. METHOD(S): Twenty-four frontline HCP participated in this crossover pilot where the viewing order of the experiences were randomized. All participants attended in-person consent, baseline, and end-of-study visits. The intervention consisted of viewing 2 nature-based scenes (""walk in the woods"" and ""forest of focus"") through 3-D VR and with computer 4K graphic imagery. Randomization took place with regards to the viewing order (VR vs 4K computer video, scene 1 and 2). Outcomes measured were safety, acceptability and changes in intensity of anxiety feelings, resilience, emotional distress, cognitive function, and self-efficacy. RESULT(S): Among the 26 HCP expressing interest in the study, 24 enrolled in this study. The majority were male (58.3%), white (66.7%) and of an average age of 46.3+/-10.5years (standard deviation (SD)). End of the study survey showed that almost all participants (96%) would participate in the study again and recommend it to others. Twenty-three of the 24 participants also felt relaxed after seeing the imagery. With respect to anxiety (as measured by the STAI Y1), the VR ""walk in the woods"" had the greatest reduction from pre to post (6.4 points, SD=5.98) followed by VR ""forest of focus"" (5.8 points, SD=9.29), computer screen ""forest of focus"" (5.0 points, SD=8.89), and computer screen ""walk in the woods"" (4.1 points, SD=6.22). All 4 sessions had a significant decrease in score from pre to post (P-values <=.005), but there was no significant difference in the change from pre- to post-session between the 4 groups (P-value=.5835). CONCLUSION(S): The use of the VR among HCP has promise for reducing stress among health care providers during a high stress period, such as a pandemic but much larger studies are needed.",2022,1-Jan,Journal of primary care & community health,13,,2.15013E+16,637647171,,,#1084,Croghan 2022,,
Validation studies of virtual reality simulation performance metrics for mechanical thrombectomy in ischemic stroke,"Crossley, R.; Liebig, T.; Holtmannspoetter, M.; Lindkvist, J.; Henn, P.; Lonn, L.; Gallagher, A. G.","Introduction Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has transformed the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, patient access to MT may be limited due to a shortage of doctors specifically trained to perform MT. The studies reported here were done to (1) develop, operationally define, and seek consensus from procedure experts on the metrics which best characterize a reference procedure for the performance of an MT for ischemic stroke and (2) evaluate their construct validity when implemented in a virtual reality (VR) simulation. Methods In study 1, the metrics for a reference approach to an MT procedure for ischemic stroke of 10 phases, 46 steps, and 56 errors and critical errors, were presented to an international Delphi panel of 21 consultant level interventional neuroradiologists (INRs). In study 2, the metrics were used to assess 8 expert and 10 novice INRs performing a VR simulated routine MT procedure. Results In study 1, the Delphi panel reached consensus on the appropriateness of the procedure metrics for a reference approach to MT in ischemic stroke. Group differences in median scores in study 2 demonstrated that experienced INRs performed the case 19% faster (P=0.029), completed 40% more procedure phases (P=0.009), 20% more steps (P=0.012), and made 42% fewer errors (P=0.016) than the novice group. Conclusions The international Delphi panel agreed metrics implemented in a VR simulation of MT distinguished between the computer scored procedure performance of INR experts and novices. The studies reported here support the demonstration of face, content, and construct validity of the MT metrics. Copyright © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

The impact of tiredness on virtual reality robotic surgical skills,"Cumpanas, A. A.; Bardan, R.; Ferician, O.; Latcu, S. C.; Lazar, O. F.; Duta, C.","Introduction: The effect of tiredness has been proved for the surgeons' musculature performing laparoscopic or robotic procedures (physical stress). Mental stress after robotic surgery has been reported as well. It is still unclear how much the surgical skills are altered and which types of skills are more affected at the final steps of long, complex robotic surgical procedures. Aim(s): To evaluate to what extent the surgeon's skills are influenced by long procedures, using the objective assessment of different surgical skills by a virtual reality robotic simulator. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen surgeons were asked to perform a continuous 4 h virtual robotic surgical simulator training session. At the beginning of simulator training and at the end of each of the 4 h of training, three exercises of increasing difficulty were selected to be performed in order to assess the surgeons' skills. Result(s): There were statistically significant differences between the initial and final overall scores for all the three exercises, the final outcomes being inferior. The specific metrics for each exercise slightly improved within 1 h from the beginning and thereafter decreased to a statistically significantly inferior value. Conclusion(s): The specific metrics on the virtual reality robotic surgical simulator were altered after a 4-hour console training period. Further larger and more complex studies are necessary to evaluate the translation from the simulator to real-life robotic surgery. Copyright © 2020 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

A phenomenological study of the use of 360degree Virtual Reality (VR) video in pediatric and neonatal resuscitation training,"Curran, V.; Xu, X.; Simmons, K.; Fleet, L.; Coombs, H.; Porter, R.; White, S.; Bessell, C.; Deshpandey, A.; Shah, A.; Waheed, S.; Nuttall, R. M.","360degree virtual reality (VR) video has emerged as an innovative technology with exciting potential for facilitating immersive learning experiences in health sciences training areas such as resuscitation. 360degree VR using virtual reality headsets offers a portable and standardized way to provide 3-dimensional (3D) videos in a convenient and flexible way to healthcare providers across many different geographic locales. The purpose of this study was to explore the use of VR headsets and 360degree video for pediatric and neonatal resuscitation training. A phenomenological approach was adopted to explore healthcare providers' experiences of VR headsets and 360degree video. Thirty-six (N = 36) healthcare providers (physicians, registered nurses and respiratory therapists) and learners trained in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) and/or the Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) program viewed 360degree video(s) relevant to their training using Oculus Go Goggles and provided feedback via focus groups or interviews. Participant experiences were analyzed using a thematic analysis technique based on descriptive phenomenology. The key reported benefits of 360degree video included enhanced experience of immersion in resuscitation scenarios, a strong sense of presence, and a greater level of interest. The main educational value reported included use for self-learning and supplementing traditional teaching methods and resources. Suggestions for enhancements and future use included improving visual and audio quality, interactivity, and realistic features. A high level of acceptance of VR headsets and 360degree video was reported by healthcare providers with key suggestions for enhancing use of this simulation technology in the future.

Factors Impacting Initial Arthroscopy Performance and Skill Progression in Novice Trainees,"Cychosz, C. C.; Tofte, J. N.; Johnson, A.; Carender, C.; Gao, Y.; Phisitkul, P.","Background: Arthroscopy is one of the cornerstone skills learned during orthopaedic residency training. Previous studies have attempted to identify characteristics of arthroscopy naive individuals leading to superior initial arthroscopic performance with conflicting findings. Furthermore, other virtual reality simulator studies consisting of beginner trainees, have noted that certain individuals fail to progress at the rate of their peers despite rigorous training. Therefore the purpose of this study was to 1) identify trainee characteristics that may have an impact on initial arthroscopy skill and performance and 2) identify trainee characteristics affecting their ability to improve through training on an arthroscopy simulator. Method(s): Forty-three medical students with no prior arthroscopy experience performed a diagnostic knee arthroscopy using an anatomic virtual reality simulator. Prior to the procedure, information was collected about each participant regarding various demographics, sports involvement, hand dominance, specialty interest, 3-D video game use and experience assisting in the operating room. Their baseline performance was measured using the following outcomes: time (seconds), camera path length (CPL) (centimeters), and an overall composite score. A subgroup consisting of 22 students underwent training with a non-anatomic virtual arthroscopy simulator consisting of a series of 5 self-guided modules after their initial knee scope. This group was retested using the same diagnostic knee scope one to two weeks later. Participant background characteristics were correlated with initial performance on the knee scope and the change from the first to second knee scope in the sub-group that completed the training. Result(s): At the time of the initial diagnostic knee arthroscopy, performance was most strongly correlated with how often an applicant currently plays video games and how often they have played video games in the past. However, this was only a weak correlation (r= 0.29 and 0.24, respectively). Interestingly, students pursuing a non-surgical residency outperformed those interested in a surgical specialty in all outcome measurements at baseline, although this did not reach a level of significance. Year of training in medical school, age, hand dominance, current or past participation in sports requiring hand-eye coordination, and number of surgical cases they have assisted in for did not influence initial performance. Participants that have operated another type of scope (e.g. bronchoscopy, laparoscopy) in the past showed a trend towards higher performance in composite score (21.6 vs 14.9, p = 0.07), although this did not reach a level of significance. Regarding the change in performance of those that completed the non-anatomic training prior to the second knee scope, change in time to complete the procedure was significantly different between participants in different years of medical school. Fourth year medical students improved by an average of 421 seconds compared to 98 seconds, 127, and 140 seconds for the other classes, p = 0.02. Those who have regularly participated in sports requiring hand eye coordination in the past improved their time (182 vs 78 seconds, p = 0.0245) and camera path length (96 vs 31 cm, p = 0.0372) significantly more than those were not involved in sports. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates that baseline arthroscopy performance correlates most highly with 3D video game experience. The ability of trainees to learn arthroscopy using a virtual reality simulator appears to be influenced more by those who have regularly participated in sports requiring hand eye coordination rather than video game use.

Fundamentals of Arthroscopic Surgery Training Program Improves Knee Arthroscopy Simulator Performance in Arthroscopic Trainees,"Cychosz, C. C.; Tofte, J. N.; Johnson, A.; Gao, Y.; Phisitkul, P.","Purpose: To determine the effectiveness of a nonanatomic simulator in developing basic arthroscopy motor skills transferable to an anatomic model. Method(s): Forty-three arthroscopy novice individuals currently enrolled in medical school were recruited to perform a diagnostic knee arthroscopy using a high-fidelity virtual reality arthroscopic simulator providing haptic feedback after viewing a video of an expert performing an identical procedure. Students were then randomized into an experimental or control group. The experimental group then completed a series of self-guided training modules using the fundamentals of arthroscopy simulator training nonanatomic modules including camera centering, tracking, periscoping, palpation, and collecting stars in a three-dimensional space. Both groups completed another diagnostic knee arthroscopy between 1 and 2 weeks later. Camera path length, time, tibia and femur cartilage damage, as well as a composite score were recorded by the simulator on each attempt. Result(s): The experimental group (n = 22) showed superior performance in composite score (30.09 vs 24, P = .046) and camera path length (71.51 cm vs 109.07 cm, P = .0274) at the time of the second diagnostic knee arthroscope compared with the control group (n = 21). The experimental group also showed significantly greater improvement in composite score between the first and second arthroscopes compared with the control group (14.27 vs 4.95, P < .01). Femoral and tibial cartilage damage were not significantly improved between arthroscopy attempts (-0.86% vs -1.45%, P = .40) and (-1.10 vs -1.27%, P = .83), respectively. Conclusion(s): The virtual reality-based fundamentals of arthroscopy simulator training nonanatomic simulator is beneficial in developing basic motor skills in arthroscopy novice individuals resulting in significantly greater composite performance in an anatomic knee model. Based on the results of this study, it appears that there may be benefit from nonanatomic simulators in general as part of an arthroscopy training program.

Developing a contextualised blended learning framework to enhance medical physics student learning and engagement,"Czaplinski, I.; Fielding, A. L.","As a specialist field of study, medical physicists require a broad range of knowledge and skills to operate competently in their workplace. In Australia, these competencies are accredited by the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM). Education and training for medical physicists therefore consists of an exhaustive range of knowledge areas. This is made even more challenging due to the extremely diverse backgrounds of students in these specialist courses of study. These factors frequently lead to a disengagement by students with learning activities. To address some of these challenges, the Radiotherapy Physics unit in a Masters level Medical Physics course of study was re-designed to increase active learning that included scaffolded in-class and online tasks and supported by virtual reality simulations. These re-design initiatives were informed by a diverse team including academic and clinical medical physicists as well as education experts. A survey, conducted over two consecutive years was used to gain students perceptions about the re-design. The questions were designed to see if the students felt engaged with the various learning activities. Analysis of the survey data indicates that there was an overall improvement in students' engagement with the learning activities and the learning content. The paper further discusses nuanced understanding about the ways in which students engaged with the various learning activities including online, in-class, practicals and industry attachments. The paper discusses the appropriately informed learning activities that can be used to improve student engagement for highly specialised, content heavy areas of study.

Does Warm-Up Training in a Virtual Reality Simulator Improve Surgical Performance? A Prospective Randomized Analysis,"da Cruz, J. A. S.; dos Reis, S. T.; Cunha Frati, R. M.; Duarte, R. J.; Nguyen, H.; Srougi, M.; Passerotti, C. C.","Introduction Virtual reality surgical simulators (VRSS) have been showing themselves as a valuable tool in laparoscopy training and education. Taking in consideration the effectiveness of the VRSS, new uses for this tool have been purposed. In sports, warming up before exercise clearly shows benefit in performance. It is hypothesized that warming up in the VRSS before going to the operating room may show benefit in surgical performance. Objective Verify whether there is benefit in surgical performance with preoperatory warm-up using a VRSS. Materials and Methods A total of 20 medical students with basic knowledge in laparoscopy were divided in 2 groups (I and II). Group I performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a porcine model. Group II performed preoperative warm-up in a VRSS and then performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a porcine model. The performance between both groups was compared regarding quantitative parameters (time for dissection of the gallbladder pedicle, time for clipping the pedicle, time for cutting the pedicle, time for gallbladder removal, total operative time, and aspirated blood loss) and qualitative parameters (depth perception, bimanual dexterity, efficiency, tissue handling, and autonomy) based on a previously validated score system, in which the higher the score, the better the result. Data were analyzed with level of significance of 5%. Results The group that underwent preoperative warm-up (group II) showed significantly superior results as to the time for dissection of the gallbladder pedicle (11.91 +/- 9.85 vs. 4.52 +/- 2.89 min, p = 0.012), time for clipping the pedicle (5.51 +/- 2.36 vs. 2.89 +/- 2.76 min, p = 0.004), time for cutting the pedicle (1.84 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.13 +/- 0.51, p = 0.019), aspirated blood loss (171 +/- 112 vs. 57 +/- 27.8 ml, p = 0.006), depth perception (4.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.67, p = 0.004), bianual dexterity (4.2 +/- 0.78 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.67, p = 0.004), tissue handling (4.2 +/- 0.91 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.66, p = 0.012), and autonomy (4.9 +/- 0.31 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.96, p = 0.028). There was no difference in time for gallbladder removal (11.58 +/- 4.31 vs. 15.08 +/- 4.51 min, p = 0.096), total operative time (30.8 +/- 11.07 vs. 25.60 +/- 5.10 min, p = 0.188), and efficiency (4 +/- 0.66 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.69, p = 0.320).

Augmenting the training space of an epidural needle insertion simulator with HoloLens,"da Silva, D.; Costa, C. B.; da Silva, N. A.; Ventura, I.; Leite, F. P.; Lopes, D. S.","The goal of this study is to explore the potential of the Optical See-Through Augmented Reality (OST-AR) in the training of median and paramedian epidural anaesthesia administration. To this end, we propose EpiduralLens, an epidural needle insertion simulator that augments the training space by resorting to a dummy, a HoloLens, an AR target, 3D sound feedback, and voice commands. The proposed system projects relevant 3D anatomical information and visual guides that are placed on and around the dummy, which are complemented with aural feedback that guides the instruction process. EpiduralLens was evaluated by 6 anaesthesiologists. The results of the formal evaluation sessions indicate that our prototype had high acceptability by the experts, verifying that combining an aural interface with 3D visual interface is a useful way to aid immersion and improve the learnability of trainees. Moreover, the participants showed interest in using the application in future sessions as a training aid for median and paramedian epidural anaesthesia administration.

Examining the benefits of extended reality in neurosurgery: A systematic review,"Dadario, N. B.; Quinoa, T.; Khatri, D.; Boockvar, J.; Langer, D.; D'Amico, R. S.","While well-established in other surgical subspecialties, the benefits of extended reality, consisting of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) technologies, remains underexplored in neurosurgery despite its increasing utilization. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of the effects of extended reality (XR) in neurosurgery with an emphasis on the perioperative period, to provide a guide for future clinical optimization. Seven primary electronic databases were screened following guidelines outlined by PRISMA and the Institute of Medicine. Reported data related to outcomes in the perioperative period and resident training were all examined, and a focused analysis of studies reporting controlled, clinical outcomes was completed. After removal of duplicates, 2548 studies were screened with 116 studies reporting measurable effects of XR in neurosurgery. The majority (82%) included cranial based applications related to tumor surgery with 34% showing improved resection rates and functional outcomes. A rise in high-quality studies was identified from 2017 to 2020 compared to all previous years (p = 0.004). Primary users of the technology were: 56% neurosurgeon (n = 65), 28% residents (n = 33) and 5% patients (n = 6). A final synthesis was conducted on 10 controlled studies reporting patient outcomes. XR technologies have demonstrated benefits in preoperative planning and multimodal neuronavigation especially for tumor surgery. However, few studies have reported patient outcomes in a controlled design demonstrating a need for higher quality data. XR platforms offer several advantages to improve patient outcomes and specifically, the patient experience for neurosurgery.

Virtual reality simulator metrics cannot be used to assess competence in ureteronephroscopy and stone removal-a validation study,"Dagnaes-Hansen, J.; Konge, L.; Andreassen, K. H.; Hansen, R. B.","Objective: The growing use of simulation-based training makes it necessary to develop efficient training programs in order to ensure optimal use of time and resources. Our aim was to develop and gather validity evidence for a simulation-based test in ureteronephroscopy and set a pass/fail standard for the test that will allow future mastery learning. Design(s): This study is a validation study. A test in ureteronephroscopy and stone removal on the URO MentorTM virtual reality simulator (3D Systems, USA) was developed by two experienced urologists in order to ensure content. Participants with different experience completed three standardized tasks on the simulator and simulator-generated metrics were used as outcome parameters to minimize bias and ensure a fair response process. Result(s): Twenty novices, 15 intermediates, and 8 experienced urologists were included in the study. Validity evidence for internal structure and relationship to other variables was questionable with weak and mostly insignificant correlations across all four metrics (Cronbach's alpha = 0.14, p = 0.15) and across the three modules (Cronbach's alpha = 0.41 (p = 0.02), 0.35 (p = 0.06), 0.10 (p = 0.35), and 0.30 (p = 0.09) for each metric, respectively). It was not possible to establish a pass/fail score for the simulation test with meaningful consequences. Conclusion(s): Our study showed that automatically generated simulator metrics cannot be used as a valid way of assessing competence in ureteronephroscopy. Virtual-reality simulator training could still be a valuable and patient-safe way to practice these skills, but an experienced supervisor is needed to determine when the trainee is ready to continue to supervised practice on patients.

"Simulation for skills training in neurosurgery: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and analysis of progressive scholarly acceptance","Davids, J.; Manivannan, S.; Darzi, A.; Giannarou, S.; Ashrafian, H.; Marcus, H. J.","At a time of significant global unrest and uncertainty surrounding how the delivery of clinical training will unfold over the coming years, we offer a systematic review, meta-analysis, and bibliometric analysis of global studies showing the crucial role simulation will play in training. Our aim was to determine the types of simulators in use, their effectiveness in improving clinical skills, and whether we have reached a point of global acceptance. A PRISMA-guided global systematic review of the neurosurgical simulators available, a meta-analysis of their effectiveness, and an extended analysis of their progressive scholarly acceptance on studies meeting our inclusion criteria of simulation in neurosurgical education were performed. Improvement in procedural knowledge and technical skills was evaluated. Of the identified 7405 studies, 56 studies met the inclusion criteria, collectively reporting 50 simulator types ranging from cadaveric, low-fidelity, and part-task to virtual reality (VR) simulators. In all, 32 studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 7 randomised controlled trials. A random effects, ratio of means effects measure quantified statistically significant improvement in procedural knowledge by 50.2% (ES 0.502; CI 0.355; 0.649, p < 0.001), technical skill including accuracy by 32.5% (ES 0.325; CI - 0.482; - 0.167, p < 0.001), and speed by 25% (ES - 0.25, CI - 0.399; - 0.107, p < 0.001). The initial number of VR studies (n = 91) was approximately double the number of refining studies (n = 45) indicating it is yet to reach progressive scholarly acceptance. There is strong evidence for a beneficial impact of adopting simulation in the improvement of procedural knowledge and technical skill.

This study was designed as a crossover study. One half of the students practiced without FFB, whereas one half practiced with FFB. Both groups practiced four sessions lasting 45 minutes on a cross preparation. In the fifth session, test 1 was scheduled. After test 1, the same practicing and testing protocol was followed, although the environment was switched. After test 2, participants filled out a questionnaire. For the statistical analysis, only the questionnaires of the students who participated in both tests were processed. RESULTS: The results of test 1 and test 2 revealed that only students who used FFB were able to pass the tests. The questionnaire outcomes supported the results of both tests; 100% of the students preferred working with FFB.

Result(s): Although several methods are included in the published literature to teach orthopaedic residents, only arthroscopy of the knee and shoulder joint is well described. Hip arthroscopy has a steeper learning curve and thus the use of simulation training as a complementary teaching method is even more important. Conclusion(s): Currently, open surgery skills for joint arthroplasty are largely acquired by apprenticeship learning. Simulation training in the form of virtual reality could contribute to better performance of residents, decreasing operation time and improving patient safety.

Training through digitization: The case for virtual reauty simulation,"Denami, M.","These days, digitization is a topic of discussion in more and more sectors, everything from national education to the private sector, from business to the health sector. The digitization initiative is a choice that is often made to reduce the space and time constraints linked to a certain activity: for example, e-learning and MOOCS are helping to make training sessions more modular as well as independent of the location, available at any time of the day or week. The pharmaceutical industry has also undertaken various aspects of this digitization initiative. As such, this article is intended to present how LabQuest, the first clean room simulator, is contributing to this digitization initiative for the training needs of operators who must acquire skills related to production within an aseptic setting. To this end, we'll begin with an overview of the training that's currently available in pharmaceutical circles for the same topics, and then make an effort to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches. We'll then explain what was involved in the design initiative; we'll continue with a description of the validation procedure that helped to bring to light the greater efficiency of this simulation tool with regard to the development of production skills in a sterile area; finally, we'll compare the experiences of the people (operators and trainers) from pharmaceutical companies within which this training solution has been deployed.

Methodology to develop a virtual reality training for good practices in the preparation of anti-cancer drugs,"Descotes, G.; Moine, M.; Beau, F.; Noyer, V.; Nicoulaud, J. C.; Divanon, F.; Jourdan, N.; Bobay-Madic, A.; Rodier, S.","Objective: Describe the process for designing and creating SimUPAC 360degree, a virtual reality training in anti-cancer drug production units. Method(s): A multi-centre (a University Hospital, a General Hospital and a Cancer Control Centre), inter-professional (pharmacists, hospital pharmacy technicians and health executives) working group has been set up. It was based on videoconferencing and online document sharing. The work was divided into six phases: choice of target audience and training objectives, definition of the business model, development of the scenario, shooting and editing, creation of the training tool and finally tests, adjustments and validation of the tool. Result(s): After brainstorming, 77 errors were proposed. Three areas have been defined: covering area, storage and production area, and isolator. They contained 15 errors among the 77 proposed and 20 points of interest. The shooting was carried out over 2 days, in 2 hospitals. Assembly was carried out by a service provider specialist in real virtuality. Before to go online, the tool was tested and validated by experts. Discussion(s): The establishment of a multi-centric and interdisciplinary working group, the choice of target audience, pedagogical objectives and business model ensure the economic viability and scientific and technical robustness of the tool. The scenario development requires to define: activity areas and then, number, difficulty and typology of errors. Conclusion(s): Creation of a virtual reality training requires a consistent and structured methodology. This methodology will make it possible to develop other training scenarios.

Clinical efficacy of simulated vitreoretinal surgery to prepare surgeons for the upcoming intervention in the operating room,"Deuchler, S.; Wagner, C.; Singh, P.; Muller, M.; Al-Dwairi, R.; Benjilali, R.; Schill, M.; Ackermann, H.; Bon, D.; Kohnen, T.; Schoene, B.; Koss, M.; Koch, F.","Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of the virtual reality training simulator Eyesi to prepare surgeons for performing pars plana vitrectomies and its potential to predict the surgeons' performance. Method(s): In a preparation phase, four participating vitreoretinal surgeons performed repeated simulator training with predefined tasks. If a surgeon was assigned to perform a vitrectomy for the management of complex retinal detachment after a surgical break of at least 60 hours it was randomly decided whether a warmup training on the simulator was required (n = 9) or not (n = 12). Performance at the simulator was measured using the built-in scoring metrics. The surgical performance was determined by two blinded observers who analyzed the videorecorded interventions. One of them repeated the analysis to check for intra-observer consistency. The surgical performance of the interventions with and without simulator training was compared. In addition, for the surgeries with simulator training, the simulator performance was compared to the performance in the operating room. Result(s): Comparing each surgeon's performance with and without warmup trainingshowed a significant effect of warmup training onto the final outcome in the operating room. For the surgeries that were preceeded by the warmup procedure, the performance at the simulator was compared with the operating room performance. We found that there is a significant relation. The governing factor of low scores in the simulator were iatrogenic retinal holes, bleedings and lens damage. Surgeons who caused minor damage in the simulation also performed well in the operating room. Conclusion(s): Despite the large variation of conditions, the effect of a warmup training as well as a relation between the performance at the simulator and in the operating room was found with statistical significance. Simulator training is able to serve as a warmup to increase the average performance. Copyright © 2016 Deuchler et al.

Augmented reality in medical education: students' experiences and learning outcomes,"Dhar, P.; Rocks, T.; Samarasinghe, R. M.; Stephenson, G.; Smith, C.","Augmented reality (AR) is a relatively new technology that allows for digitally generated three-dimensional representations to be integrated with real environmental stimuli. AR can make use of smart phones, tablets, or other devices to achieve a highly stimulating learning environment and hands-on immersive experience. The use of AR in industry is becoming widespread with applications being developed for use not just for entertainment and gaming but also healthcare, retail and marketing, education, military, travel and tourism, automotive industry, manufacturing, architecture, and engineering. Due to the distinct learning advantages that AR offers, such as remote learning and interactive simulations, AR-based teaching programs are also increasingly being adopted within medical schools across the world. These advantages are further highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused an even greater shift towards online learning. In this review, we investigate the use of AR in medical training/education and its effect on students' experiences and learning outcomes. This includes the main goals of AR-based learning, such as to simplify the delivery and enhance the comprehension of complex information. We also describe how AR can enhance the experiences of medical students, by improving knowledge and understanding, practical skills and social skills. These concepts are discussed within the context of specific AR medical training programs, such as HoloHuman, OculAR SIM, and HoloPatient. Finally, we discuss the challenges of AR in learning and teaching and propose future directions for the use of this technology in medical education.",2021,1-Dec,Medical education online,26(1),,1953953,635615140,,,#1256,Dhar 2021,,
Psychomotor skills development for Veress needle placement using a virtual reality and haptics-based simulator,"Di Vece, C.; Luciano, C.; De Momi, E.","Purpose: Veress needle (VN) insertion, if not correctly performed, could cause severe injuries to intra-abdominal organs and vessels. Therefore, cognitive and psychomotor skills training is needed. Virtual reality (VR) and haptic technologies have the potential to offer realistic simulations. Method(s): We developed a novel VR and haptic surgical simulator for VN insertion to teach trainees how to correctly puncture the abdominal wall, experiencing realistic tactile sensations throughout the simulation. The simulator allows for both procedural and realistic training. We released two different versions: the first using the OpenHaptics<sup>TM</sup> (OH) Toolkit and the second exploiting CHAI3D. We evaluated the learning effect using different performance indexes (time to perform the procedure, error in insertion angle, number of undesired contacts with organs) in an insertion task for both experienced urologists and students. Result(s): A general improvement of the chosen performance indexes was registered in the second repetition of the task for both groups. From the questionnaires, the simulator leveraging OH provides the trainee with a more precise haptic feedback, whereas the one exploiting CHAI3D allows them to perform the procedure more easily thanks to the better visualization of the virtual environment. The results proved that the participants appreciated both implementations, and the System Usability Scale (SUS) test resulted in a ""good"" usability. Conclusion(s): The haptics-based and VR simulator has shown the potential to be an important resource for the basic urological training in obtaining the pneumoperitoneum and improving the acquisition of the necessary psychomotor skills, allowing for extended and more effective training without compromising patient safety.

Augmented reality-assisted video laryngoscopy and simulated neonatal intubations: A pilot study,"Dias, P. L.; Greenberg, R. G.; Goldberg, R. N.; Fisher, K.; Tanaka, D. T.","BACKGROUND: For novice providers, achieving competency in neonatal intubation is becoming increasingly difficult, possibly because of fewer intubation opportunities. In the present study, we compared intubation outcomes on manikins using direct laryngoscopy (DL), indirect video laryngoscopy (IVL) using a modified disposable blade, and augmented reality-assisted video laryngoscopy (ARVL), a novel technique using smart glasses to project a magnified video of the airway into the intubator's visual field. METHOD(S): Neonatal intensive care nurses (n = 45) with minimal simulated intubation experience were randomly assigned (n = 15) to the following 3 groups: DL, IVL, and ARVL. All participants completed 5 intubation attempts on a manikin using their assigned modalities and received verbal coaching by a supervisor, who viewed the video while assisting the IVL and ARVL groups. The outcome and time of each attempt were recorded. RESULT(S): The DL group successfully intubated on 32% of attempts compared to 72% in the IVL group and 71% in the ARVL group (P,.001). The DL group intubated the esophagus on 27% of attempts, whereas there were no esophageal intubations in either the IVL or ARVL groups (P,.001). The median (interquartile range) time to intubate in the DL group was 35.6 (22.9-58.0) seconds, compared to 21.6 (13.9-31.9) seconds in the IVL group and 20.7 (13.2-36.5) seconds in the ARVL group (P,.001). CONCLUSION(S): Simulated intubation success of neonatal intensive care nurses was significantly improved by using either IVL or ARVL compared to DL. Future prospective studies are needed to explore the potential benefits of this technology when used in real patients.

Comparing surgical experience with performance on a sinus surgery simulator,"Diment, L. E.; Ruthenbeck, G. S.; Dharmawardana, N.; Carney, A. S.; Woods, C. M.; Ooi, E. H.; Reynolds, K. J.","BACKGROUND: This study evaluates whether surgical experience influences technical competence using the Flinders sinus surgery simulator, a virtual environment designed to teach nasal endoscopic surgical skills. METHODS: Ten experienced sinus surgeons (five consultants and five registrars) and 14 novices (seven resident medical officers and seven interns/medical students) completed three simulation tasks using haptic controllers. Task 1 required navigation of the sinuses and identification of six anatomical landmarks, Task 2 required removal of unhealthy tissue while preserving healthy tissue and Task 3 entailed backbiting within pre-set lines on the uncinate process and microdebriding tissue between the cuts. RESULTS: Novices were compared with experts on a range of measures, using Mann-Whitney U -tests. Novices took longer on all tasks (Task 1: 278%, P < 0.005; Task 2: 112%, P < 0.005; Task 3: 72%, P < 0.005). In Task 1, novices' instruments travelled further than experts' (379%, P < 0.005), and provided greater maximum force (12%, P < 0.05). In Tasks 2 and 3 novices performed more cutting movements to remove the tissue (Task 2: 1500%, P < 0.005; Task 3: 72%, P < 0.005). Experts also completed more of Task 3 (66%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the Flinders sinus simulator's construct validity, differentiating between experts and novices with respect to procedure time, instrument distance travelled and number of cutting motions to complete the task.

Re-defining the virtual reality dental simulator: Demonstrating concurrent validity of clinically relevant assessment and feedback,"Dixon, J.; Towers, A.; Martin, N.; Field, J.","INTRODUCTION: Virtual reality (VR) dental simulators are gaining momentum as a useful tool to educate dental students. To date, no VR dental simulator exercise has been designed which is capable of reliably providing validated, meaningful clinical feedback to dental students. This study aims to measure the concurrent validity of the assessment and the provision of qualitative feedback, pertaining to cavity preparations by VR dental simulators. METHOD(S): A cavity preparation exercise was created on a VR dental simulator, and assessment criteria for cavity preparations were developed. The exercise was performed 10 times in order to demonstrate a range of performances, and for each, the simulator feedback was recorded. The exercises were subsequently three-dimensionally printed, and 12 clinical teachers were asked to assess the preparations according to the same criteria. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) between clinical teachers was measured using a free-marginal multirater kappa value. Clinical teacher assessment responses were compared with the VR simulator responses and percentage agreements calculated. RESULT(S): IRR values for each exercise ranged from 0.39 to 0.77 (69.39%-88.48%). The assessment of smoothness (kappafree 0.58, 78.79%) and ability to follow the outline (kappafree 0.56, 77.88%) demonstrated highest agreement between clinical teachers, whilst the assessment of undercut (kappafree 0.15, 57.58%) and depth (kappafree 0.28, 64.09%) had the lowest agreement. The modal percentage agreement between clinical teachers and the VR simulator was, on average, 78% across all exercises. CONCLUSION(S): The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to provide reliable and clinically relevant qualitative feedback via a VR dental simulator. Further research should look to employ this technique across a broader range of exercises that help to develop other complex operative dental skills. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

"A Structured, Hybrid Cystoscopy Simulation Curriculum for Obstetrics/Gynecology Residents","Do, L.; Pasha, K.; Sanchez, S.; Montoya, T. I.; Maldonado, P. A.","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the subjective and objective cystoscopy skills of gynecology residents before and after implementation of a comprehensive simulation curriculum. METHOD(S): Residents in an obstetrics/gynecology program at a single academic institution participated in a 6-week cystoscopy simulation course. Residents attended an initial orientation and didactic presentation, and then weekly 20- to 30-minute training sessions using a water balloon model and a virtual reality simulator. Pretesting and posttesting were performed, including (1) subjective self-assessments, (2) a written quiz, and (3) objective structured assessment of technical skills. Paired t test was used to assess the differences in residents' objective assessment scores before and after simulation training. RESULT(S): A total of 16 residents were recruited. Residents reported significant subjective improvements in comfort, confidence, and proficiency in performing cystoscopy after completing the curriculum. Their overall objective assessment improved, including written quiz scores (mean score, 49% vs 78%; P < 0.001), efficiency in cystoscope assembly (means score, 0 vs 4; P < 0.001), overall bladder survey score (56% vs 86%, P < 0.001), and global rating score (mean score, 15 vs 24; P < 0.001). Residents tended to prefer the water-balloon model compared with the virtual reality simulator (75% vs 25%). CONCLUSION(S): Obstetrics/gynecology residents demonstrated significant improvements in subjective and objective measures of skill after completion of a 6-week cystoscopy simulation training course using a combination of low- and high-fidelity models. Although universal cystoscopy at the time of hysterectomy for benign indications remains controversial, cystoscopy simulation should remain an important part of resident training.

Online education in cytotechnology programs: A pilot study,"Donnelly, A. D.; Mukherjee, M. S.; Lyden, E. R.; Radio, S. J.","Introduction: The University of Nebraska Medical Center's cytotechnology program has received requests for an on-line program. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that on-line education with virtual microscopy (VM) achieves similar screening and interpretation skills as traditional teaching methods using light microscopy (LM). Material(s) and Method(s): The pilot phase was conducted using the first two courses in the program. The students were divided into two groups; traditional and virtual. The virtual group replaced LM with VM, while the traditional group utilized traditional teaching methods. At the end of the two courses, the virtual group was shown how to use LM and was given glass slide examinations. Result(s): The mean of the female genital tract (FGT) screening quizzes and exams of the traditional group was 92.5; the mean for the virtual group was 86.8. For the respiratory tract (RT) course, the traditional group had a mean of 96 for their screening exams while the virtual group's was 85.3. The glass slide examinations (FGT Mean = 98, RT Mean = 95.3) given to the virtual group at the end of the pilot study demonstrated their ability to apply screening and interpretation skill learned from VM to LM. Conclusion(s): The study concludes that screening and interpretation skills of the traditional and virtual groups were similar. It appears possible to train students using VM as the sole method of teaching. The study will be extended to another cohort of students using the entire curriculum to further demonstrate the soundness of these results.

Using 360degree Video to Enable Affective Learning in Nursing Education,"Donnelly, F.; McLiesh, P.; Bessell, S. A.","BACKGROUND: The affective domain describes learning associated with feelings, values, and emotions. Although this domain was first described in the late 1960s, a significant emphasis on skills and knowledge still remains. This prominence is evident despite global concerns about standards of practice and the place for empathy and care in nursing education. The emergence of newer technologies, such as 360degree video, provides an opportunity to revisit the design and delivery of affective learning. METHOD(S): Using the taxonomy of the affective domain, a 360degree video viewed through a virtual reality headset was developed to give nursing and medical students insight on the patient experience and an orientation to the operating room. RESULT(S): Careful planning and consideration of how the affective domain can inform design of learning and teaching materials resulted in an engaging and informative learning experience. Being aware of how each level of the domain informs the next is essential to develop effective affective teaching plans. CONCLUSION(S): Affective learning traditionally has been difficult to deliver and assess. Technology such as 360degree video provides an engaging, reproducible, and consistent platform for delivering a domain of education. [J Nurs Educ. 2020;59(7):409-412.].

Face and content validation of a Virtual Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery Trainer (VTESTTM),"Dorozhkin, D.; Nemani, A.; Roberts, K.; Ahn, W.; Halic, T.; Dargar, S.; Wang, J.; Cao, C. G. L.; Sankaranarayanan, G.; De, S.","Background: Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is an emerging surgical paradigm, where peritoneal access is achieved through one of the natural orifices of the body. It is being reported as a safe and feasible surgical technique with significantly reduced external scarring. Virtual Translumenal Endoscopic Surgical Trainer (VTESTTM) is the first virtual reality simulator for the NOTES. The VTESTTM simulator was developed to train surgeons in the hybrid transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy procedure. The initial version of the VTESTTM simulator underwent face validation at the 2013 Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research (NOSCAR) summit. Several areas of improvement were identified as a result, and the corresponding modifications were implemented in the simulator. This manuscript outlines the results of the subsequent evaluation study, performed in order to assess the face and content validity of the latest VTESTTM simulator. Method(s): Twelve subjects participated in an institutional review board-approved study that took place at the 2014 NOSCAR summit. Six of the 12 subjects, who are experts with NOTES experience, were used for face and content validation. The subjects performed the hybrid transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy procedure on VTESTTM that included identifying the Calot's triangle, clipping and cutting the cystic duct/artery, and detaching the gallbladder. The subjects then answered five-point Likert scale feedback questionnaires for face and content validity. Result(s): Overall, subjects rated 12/15 questions as 3.0 or greater (60 %), for face validity questions regarding the realism of the anatomical features, interface, and the tasks. Subjects also highly rated the usefulness of the simulator in learning the fundamental NOTES technical skills (3.50 +/- 0.84). Content validity results indicate a high level of usefulness of the VTESTTM for training prior to operating room experience (4.17 +/- 0.75).

OR fire virtual training simulator: design and face validity,"Dorozhkin, D.; Olasky, J.; Jones, D. B.; Schwaitzberg, S. D.; Jones, S. B.; Cao, C. G. L.; Molina, M.; Henriques, S.; Wang, J.; Flinn, J.; De, S.","Background: The Virtual Electrosurgical Skill Trainer is a tool for training surgeons the safe operation of electrosurgery tools in both open and minimally invasive surgery. This training includes a dedicated team-training module that focuses on operating room (OR) fire prevention and response. The module was developed to allow trainees, practicing surgeons, anesthesiologist, and nurses to interact with a virtual OR environment, which includes anesthesia apparatus, electrosurgical equipment, a virtual patient, and a fire extinguisher. Wearing a head-mounted display, participants must correctly identify the ""fire triangle"" elements and then successfully contain an OR fire. Within these virtual reality scenarios, trainees learn to react appropriately to the simulated emergency. A study targeted at establishing the face validity of the virtual OR fire simulator was undertaken at the 2015 Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons conference. Method(s): Forty-nine subjects with varying experience participated in this Institutional Review Board-approved study. The subjects were asked to complete the OR fire training/prevention sequence in the VEST simulator. Subjects were then asked to answer a subjective preference questionnaire consisting of sixteen questions, focused on the usefulness and fidelity of the simulator. Result(s): On a 5-point scale, 12 of 13 questions were rated at a mean of 3 or greater (92%). Five questions were rated above 4 (38%), particularly those focusing on the simulator effectiveness and its usefulness in OR fire safety training. A total of 33 of the 49 participants (67%) chose the virtual OR fire trainer over the traditional training methods such as a textbook or an animal model. Conclusion(s): Training for OR fire emergencies in fully immersive VR environments, such as the VEST trainer, may be the ideal training modality. The face validity of the OR fire training module of the VEST simulator was successfully established on many aspects of the simulation.

A model for predicting the GEARS score from virtual reality surgical simulator metrics,"Dubin, A. K.; Julian, D.; Tanaka, A.; Mattingly, P.; Smith, R.","Background: Surgical education relies heavily upon simulation. Assessment tools include robotic simulator assessments and Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) metrics, which have been validated. Training programs use GEARS for proficiency testing; however, it requires a trained human evaluator. Due to limited time, learners are reliant on surgical simulator feedback to improve their skills. GEARS and simulator scores have been shown to be correlated but in what capacity is unknown. Our goal is to develop a model for predicting GEARS score using simulator metrics. Method(s): Linear and multivariate logistic regressions were used on previously reported data by this group. Subjects performed simple (Ring and Rail 1) and complex (Suture Sponge 1) tasks on simulators, the dV-Trainer (dVT) and the da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS). They were scored via simulator metrics and GEARS. Result(s): A linear model for each simulator and exercise showed a positive linear correlation. Equations were developed for predicting GEARS Total Score from simulator Overall Score. Next, the effects of each individual simulator metric on the GEARS Total Score for each simulator and exercise were examined. On the dVSS, Excessive Instrument Force was significant for Ring and Rail 1 and Instrument Collision was significant for Suture Sponge 1. On the dVT, Time to Complete was significant for both exercises. Once the significant variables were identified, multivariate models were generated. Comparing the predicted GEARS Total Score from the linear model (using only simulator Overall Score) to that using the multivariate model (using the significant variables for each simulator and exercise), the results were similar. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that trainees can use simulator Overall Score to predict GEARS Total Score using our linear regression equations. This can improve the training process for those preparing for high-stakes assessments.

Clinical Training during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experiences of Nursing Students and Implications for Education,"Dziurka, M.; Machul, M.; Ozdoba, P.; Obuchowska, A.; Kotowski, M.; Grzegorczyk, A.; Pydys, A.; Dobrowolska, B.","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused difficulties in the organization of clinical classes for nursing students. It is therefore important to explore students' experiences related to participation in clinical classes during the pandemic and to draw conclusions that will allow for the introduction of innovations enabling the development of the required professional competencies as part of training during current and future pandemic restrictions. In this study, we aimed to explore the experiences of nursing students related to clinical education during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify practical implications for this education in the future. A qualitative study was performed based on individual interviews among Polish nursing students (n = 20). The study is reported using the COREQ checklist. Content analysis was applied, and five main categories were identified, including 'the key role of clinical mentor', 'theory-practice gap', 'ambivalent emotions and ethical challenges', 'to be part of the team', and 'strengthened professional identity'. The results of our research indicate that higher education institutions should implement clear strategies to support students, both in terms of psychological support and compensation of professional skills, the development of which might be limited during the pandemic. Modern technologies, including medical simulations, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and telemedicine should be used in the practical teaching of nursing students to educate them on how to cope with difficult, new situations, build decision-making skills, and solve problems.

METHOD(S): Medical students and junior doctors were taught normal and abnormal sonographic fetal brain anatomy using conventional means (video lectures and review articles; control group) or additionally with selected VR objects from a novel fetal brain atlas (Pocket Brain, http://pb.fetal.ch; study group). Knowledge, speed of recognition and retention of diagnostic ability were tested in multiple-choice questionnaires 1 and 4 months after teaching, and the results were compared between those taught using conventional means only and those taught using VR objects. RESULT(S): Participants taught using VR objects answered significantly more questions correctly and solved the tests quicker than those taught using conventional methods only, both 1 and 4months after teaching. CONCLUSION(S): The use of VR objects in teaching fetal ultrasound significantly improves learning efficiency and knowledge retention. Copyright © 2018 ISUOG.

Is virtual reality suitable for hand hygiene training in health care workers? Evaluating an application for acceptability and effectiveness,"Eichel, V. M.; Brandt, C.; Brandt, J.; Jabs, J. M.; Mutters, N. T.","Background: For effective prevention of nosocomial transmissions continuous training and motivation of health care workers (HCW) are essential to maintain and increase compliance with high rates of hand hygiene. The use of Virtual Reality (VR) seems to be a contemporary and interesting approach for hand hygiene training in HCW. Nevertheless, HCW should be asked for their preferences as intrinsic motivation is essential for compliance with hand hygiene and training success should be evaluated. Method(s): A prospective, cross-controlled trial was conducted at two wards in a tertiary care hospital comparing a conventional lecture for hand hygiene to the use of VR. Both interventions were assigned at ward level. Primary outcome was HCW acceptance, which was verified in a third ward, secondary outcomes were hand rub consumption and compliance to indications for hand hygiene as proposed by WHO. Result(s): In summary, 81 trainings were conducted, 48 VR trainings and 33 trainings by lecture. VR training was well accepted by HCW with a mean score in all items from 3.9 to 4.3 (out of 5). While most HCW (69%) would prefer VR teaching rather than a lecture for hand hygiene education, only 4% preferred the traditional lecture. 400 observations of hand hygiene indications were made, 50 before intervention and 50 after each intervention at the three wards. Mean proportion of correct and indication-appropriate performances was 81% before intervention, 87% after VR training (p = 0.12), and 95% after lecture (p = 0.04). Hand rub consumption did not change significantly in any group. Conclusion(s): Due to the high acceptance of VR technology among healthcare workers, it can be considered an interesting addition to conventional lectures for teaching hand hygiene. However, the hypothesis that VR teaching has a higher impact on hand rub use and hand hygiene compliance than a conventional lecture cannot be confirmed.

Immersive and interactive virtual reality to improve learning and retention of neuroanatomy in medical students: a randomized controlled study,"Ekstrand, C.; Jamal, A.; Nguyen, R.; Kudryk, A.; Mann, J.; Mendez, I.","BACKGROUND: Spatial 3-dimensional understanding of the brain is essential to learning neuroanatomy, and 3-dimensional learning techniques have been proposed as tools to enhance neuroanatomy training. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of immersive virtual-reality neuroanatomy training and compare it to traditional paper-based methods. METHOD(S): In this randomized controlled study, participants consisted of first- or second-year medical students from the University of Saskatchewan recruited via email and posters displayed throughout the medical school. Participants were randomly assigned to the virtual-reality group or the paper-based group and studied the spatial relations between neural structures for 12 minutes after performing a neuroanatomy baseline test, with both test and control questions. A postintervention test was administered immediately after the study period and 5-9 days later. Satisfaction measures were obtained. RESULT(S): Of the 66 participants randomly assigned to the study groups, 64 were included in the final analysis, 31 in the virtual-reality group and 33 in the paper-based group. The 2 groups performed comparably on the baseline questions and showed significant performance improvement on the test questions following study. There were no significant differences between groups for the control questions, the postintervention test questions or the 7-day postintervention test questions. Satisfaction survey results indicated that neurophobia was decreased. INTERPRETATION: Results from this study provide evidence that training in neuroanatomy in an immersive and interactive virtual-reality environment may be an effective neuroanatomy learning tool that warrants further study. They also suggest that integration of virtual-reality into neuroanatomy training may improve knowledge retention, increase study motivation and decrease neurophobia.

The effect of a performance-based intra-procedural checklist on a simulated emergency laparoscopic task in novice surgeons,"El Boghdady, M.; Tang, B.; Alijani, A.","Surgical checklists are in use as means to reduce errors. Checklists are infrequently applied during emergency situations in surgery. We aimed to study the effect of a simple self-administered performance-based checklist on the laparoscopic task when applied during an emergency-simulated scenario. The aviation checklist for unexpected situations is commonly used for simulated training of pilots to handle emergency during flights. This checklist was adopted for use as a standardised-performance-based checklist during emergency surgical tasks. Thirty consented laparoscopic novices were exposed unexpectedly to a bleeding vessel in a laparoscopic virtual reality simulator as an emergency scenario. The task consisted of using laparoscopic clips to achieve haemostasis. Subjects were randomly allocated into two equal groups; those using the checklist that was applied once every 20 s (checklist group) and those without (control group). The checklist group performed significantly better in 5 out of 7 technical factors when compared to the control group: right instrument path length (m), median (IQR) 1.44 [1.22] versus 2.06 [1.70] (p = 0.029), right instrument angular path (degree) 312.10 (269.44 versus 541.80 [455.16] (p = 0.014), left instrument path length (m) 1.20 [0.60] versus 2.08 [2.02] (p = 0.004), and left instrument angular path (degree) 277.62 [132.11] versus 385.88 [428.42] (p = 0.017). The checklist group committed significantly fewer number of errors in the application of haemostatic clips, 3 versus 28 (p = 0.006). Although statistically not significant, total blood loss (lit) decreased in the checklist group from 0.83 [1.23] to 0.78 [0.28] (p = 0.724) and total time (sec) from 186.51 [145.69] to 125.14 [101.46] (p = 0.165).

Evaluation of Laparoscopy Virtual Reality Training on the Improvement of Trainees' Surgical Skills,"Elessawy, M.; Mabrouk, M.; Heilmann, T.; Weigel, M.; Zidan, M.; Abu-Sheasha, G.; Farrokh, A.; Bauerschlag, D.; Maass, N.; Ibrahim, M.; Kamel, D.","Background and objectives: The primary objective was to evaluate the benefit of training with virtual reality simulation. The secondary objective was to describe the short-term skill acquisition obtained by simulation training and to determine the factors affecting its magnitude. Material(s) and Method(s): We prospectively performed a three-stage evaluation: face, constructive, and predictive to evaluate the training with a laparoscopic simulator with haptic feedback. The participants (n = 63) were divided according to their level of experience into three groups: 16% residents; 46% specialists and 38% were consultants. Result(s): Face evaluation demonstrates the acceptance of the design and realism of the tasks; it showed a median score of eight (IQR 3) on a Likert scale and 54% of participants (n = 34) gave the tissue feedback a moderate rating. Constructive evaluation demonstrates the improvement of the participants in the training session and the ability of the designed task to distinguish the experienced from the inexperienced surgeon based on the performance score, at task I (transfer of pegs) and II (laparoscopic salpingectomy). There was an improvement in both tasks with a significant increase in score and reduction in time. The study showed that those with a high score at the pre-test recorded a high score post-test, showing a significant pair-wise comparison (Z) and correlation (p) showing a significant statistical significance (p < 0.001). The predictive evaluation demonstrates the beneficiary effect of training four weeks afterward on the practice of surgeons addressed with five questions. It showed an improvement regarding implementation into daily routine, performance of procedure, suturing, shortening of the operative time, and complication management.

Design(s): Randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). Setting(s): Academic obstetrics and gynecology resident training program. Intervention(s): Traditional independent study curriculum versus traditional curriculum and VisCubeSX VR curriculum Measurements and Main Results: Residents were randomized, stratified by year of training, in a 1:1 fashion to traditional independent study curriculum for pelvic anatomy versus traditional curriculum and the VisCubeSX VR anatomic model. Tests were administered to assess baseline and postintervention knowledge. A postintervention assessment of the VisCubeSX VR anatomic model was performed. Baseline, follow-up, and score improvement were compared between groups using Student t tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Thirty-one residents were randomized. There was a significant improvement in pre- and post-test scores within traditional independent study curriculum participants, 8.1 +/- 12.0 points (p = .02), and the VisCubeSX group 8.7 +/- 6.4 points (p <.001), but these improvements did not differ between groups (p = .86). This lack of between-group differences was consistent in resident year-stratified analyses. Residents exposed to the VisCubeSX VR anatomic model reported they ""somewhat"" or ""strongly agree"" (15/16 [93.8%] and 14/16 [87.5%] of residents, respectively) that the model improved their knowledge of pelvic anatomy and that the model will improve patient care. Conclusion(s): Few studies exist that compare educational outcomes of a traditional independent study of female pelvic anatomy curriculum versus immersive simulation with VR models in female pelvic anatomy.

Can virtual reality surgical simulator improve the function of the non-dominant hand in ophthalmic surgeons?,"Eltanamly, R. M.; Elmekawey, H.; Youssef, M. M.; Hassan, L. M.","Purpose: Phacoemulsification surgery requires the use of both hands; however, some surgeons may not be comfortable using their non-dominant hand, especially in critical steps such as chopping. This work aims at assessing whether a virtual reality simulator can help cataract surgeons train their non-dominant hand using the capsulorhexis module. Method(s): This was a prospective observational study including thirty ophthalmic surgeons; none of them had previous training on the EyeSi surgical simulator. Twenty-three were experienced, and seven were intermediate surgeons. Surgeons were asked to perform capsulorhexis three times using their dominant hand and then using their non-dominant hand. A performance score based on efficiency, target achievement, instrument handling, and tissue treatment was calculated by the simulator. Result(s): A significant improvement in the score of surgeons using their non-dominant hand from the first trial (69.57 +/- 18.9) to the third trial (84.9 +/- 9.2) (P < 0.001) was found, whereas such improvement was not noted with the dominant hand (P = 0.12). Twenty-six surgeons managed to reach 90% of the mean score achieved by dominant hand by using their non-dominant hand, 11 (36.7%) from the first trial, seven (23.3%) from the second, and eight (26.7%) from the third. Conclusion(s): Cataract surgeons showed significant improvement in the scores of their non-dominant hands with simulator training.

Validation of a model of intensive training in digestive laparoscopic surgery,"Enciso, S.; Diaz-Guemes, I.; Uson, J.; Sanchez-Margallo, F. M.","INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to assess a laparoscopic training model for general surgery residents. METHODS: Twelve general surgery residents carried out a training program, consisting of a theoretical session (one hour) and a hands-on session on simulator (7 h) and on animal model (13 h). For the first and last repetitions of simulator tasks and the Nissen fundoplication technique, time and scores from the global rating scale objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) were registered. Before and after the course, participants performed 4 tasks on the virtual reality simulator LAPMentorTM: 1) hand-eye coordination, 2) hand-hand coordination, 3) transference of objects and 4) cholecystectomy task, registering time and movement metrics. Moreover, the residents completed a questionnaire related to the training components on a 5-point rating scale. RESULTS: The last repetition of the tasks and the Nissen fundoplication technique were performed faster and with a higher OSATS score. After the course, the participants performed all LAPMentorTM tasks faster, increasing the speed of movements in all tasks. Number of movements decreased in tasks 2, 3 and 4; as well as path length in tasks 2 and 4. Training components were positively rated by residents, being the suture task the aspect best rated (4.90 +/- 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: This training model in digestive laparoscopic surgery has demonstrated to be valid for the improvement of basic and advanced skills of general surgery residents.

Design and evaluation of a prototype of augmented reality applied to medical devices,"Escalada-Hernandez, P.; Soto Ruiz, N.; San Martin-Rodriguez, L.","Background: According to current legislation, medical devices have to incorporate all the necessary information to eliminate or greatly minimise any problem associated with their use. However, the physical capacity of the actual device's packaging may frequently not be enough to contain all this information. To address this limitation, this study aimed to design and evaluate a prototype app for mobile devices applying augmented reality technology. The main feature of this kind of technology is combining virtual images with images from the real world. Method(s): This work, carried out in Spain, was developed in three different phases. 1)Assessment of users' needs: Through a focus group and an online questionnaire, information was obtained about the following aspects: type of medical devices likely to be included in the app, relevant information that should be included and format in which this information should be presented. 2)Development of the prototype: Considering all the functional features identified in the previous phase, the software was developed by a team of professionals specialised in AR technology and applying a user-centred model. 3)Evaluation of the software: functionality and usability were assessed by means of the think-aloud method. Result(s): 1)Assessment of users' needs: a total of 11 nurses participated in the focus group and 280 healthcare professionals answered the questionnaire. Their findings showed that users consider that information about the following aspects of medical devices should be included in the app: instructions for use, indications for use, brief description of the device, special precautions and biocompatibility, image of the content with its components and meaning of icons. 2)Description of the prototype: Once the app has been launched, when the user scans the medical device with the mobile device camera, access to the home screen is activated, where three sections can be found: name of the medical device, image of the device and four icons which provide access to: a brief description of the device, a detailed description of it, the packaging iconography and a video about use of the device. 3)Evaluation of the software: the app was defined by users as ""very intuitive"". They highlighted, as one of its main positive aspects, the chance to obtain information about the medical device just by scanning the object. Additionally, the evaluation performed through the think-aloud method identified potential improvements in the app. These improvements were subsequently implemented to make the prototype more functional. Conclusion(s): Working with potential prototype users made it possible to identify information considered relevant for these users and to delve into the format which they consider more appropriate to show this information in the prototype. Our results show that AR technology can be used as support for clinical practice.

Impact of the Haptic Virtual Reality Simulator on Dental Students' Psychomotor Skills in Preclinical Operative Dentistry,"Farag, A.; Hashem, D.","One of the current trends in dental education is to empower dental students on a global platform using advanced technology. Haptic virtual reality simulation (HVRS) is a relatively new technology in the field of teaching and learning operative dentistry. This study aims to assess the impact of haptic virtual reality simulation (HVRS) on dental students' psychomotor skills acquisition in preclinical operative dentistry. Class I cavity preparations (CP) were performed at baseline by 21 novice dental students on plastic teeth. Duration of CP was recorded and cavity features were evaluated and scored. Then, students were exposed to HVRS training on CP. Another Class I CP was performed by each student on plastic teeth after HVRS training, then evaluated, and the duration was recorded. There was a statistically significant decrease in CP performance time after HVRS training (p < 0.001) and an increase in the mean total marks of CP after HVRS training (p < 0.001). The change in the students' performance in the CP displayed a statistically significant improvement after HVRS training in smoothness of the pulpal floor (p = 0.047), pulpal floor direction (p = 0.029), buccal, lingual, and mesial wall direction (p = 0.004, p = 0.025, p = 0.002), mesial and distal wall smoothness (p = 0.01, p = 0.001), internal line angle (p = 0.024), and internal point angle (p = 0.029).

Comparative costs are presented for the planning, development, and implementation of both interventions. Initially, virtual reality is more expensive, with a cost of $229.79 per participant (total cost $18 617.54 per exercise) for the live drill versus $327.78 (total cost $106 951.14) for virtual reality. When development costs are extrapolated to repeated training over 3 years, however, the virtual exercise becomes less expensive with a cost of $115.43 per participant, while the cost of live exercises remains fixed.

Contribution of a virtual hysteroscopic simulator in the learning of hysteroscopic myoma resection. [French],"Faurant, M. C.; Francois, S.; Bouet, P. E.; Catala, L.; Lefebvre-Lacoeuille, C.; Gillard, P.; Descamps, P.; Legendre, G.","Uterine myomas are a frequent pathology affecting 20% of women of reproductive age. Myomas induce abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain and increase the risk of infertility and obstetrical complications. Symptomatic sub-mucosal myomas are classically treated by hysteroscopic resection. Simulation is a method of education and training. It could improve quality and security of cares. The aim of this study is to assess the interest of a hysteroscopic simulator for the resection of myoma by novice surgeons. Twenty medical students were recruited, in a prospective study, in august 2014. The virtual-reality simulator VirtaMed HystSimTM (VirtaMed AG, Zurich, Switzerland) was used to perform the hysteroscopic training. All students received a short demonstration of myoma resection. The practice consists of a submucous myoma type 0 resection. The procedure and the evaluation were performed before and after a specific training in hysteroscopic resection of sixty minutes long. The main outcome criteria were time for the resection before and after training. The second criteria were fluid quantity used, number of contact between optic and uterine cavity and uterine perforation. Twenty students aged from 22 to 24years were included. The time for the procedure was significantly reduced after training (170s versus 335s, P<0.01). There is the same for fluid quantity used (335mL versus 717mL, P<0.01) and the number of contact between optic and uterine cavity (0.2 contact versus 3, PCombining double low line0.012). No perforation occurred in the simulation. The results suggest that hysteroscopic simulator enhances and facilitates hysteroscopic resection for novice surgeons.

It remains unclear the relative impact each component has on the student experience and subsequent specialisation. AIMS: We evaluate the influence of having senior resident mentor during practical simulation in orthopaedic surgery has on medical student interest in surgery; their comfort in theatre; and its role in enhancing knowledge acquisition within the rotation. METHOD(S): Medical students undergoing clinical rotations in a Regional University Hospital were randomised to undertaking a virtual reality simulated operation independently or performing under the guidance of an experienced resident. Baseline levels of interest in surgery, comfort in theatre, perceived barriers to surgical learning and entry to surgery were established and compared to answers following completion of the tutorial. Qualitative feedback was collected regarding the benefits and limitations to the experience. Presented according to CONSORT guidelines. RESULT(S): Participants in the trainee guided group achieved significantly higher simulated performance scores compared to the control (p < 0001), with an increase in interest in orthopaedic surgery from baseline expressed to a statistically significant degree (p = 0.01). Participants in the unsupervised group demonstrated no significant increase in interest in Orthopaedic surgery (p = 0.3). 100% participants strongly agreed it was a beneficial learning experience which would be useful in surgical curricula. CONCLUSION(S): Surgical trainee guided simulation led to improved performance and interest in orthopaedic surgery, while virtual practical experience was felt to be a useful learning tool independent of supervision. Further research is needed to establish the role of interpersonal interactions in student surgical experience.

A pilot study to evaluate the face & construct validity of an orthopaedic virtual reality simulator,"Feeley, A.; Feeley, I.; Merghani, K.; Sheehan, E.","Aims: This study aimed to identify the face and construct validity of the Precision OS trauma module proximal femoral nail procedure. Secondary outcomes included perceived use of simulation in surgical training, with structured feedback from participants. Method(s): A comparative interventional study was carried out in a regional orthopaedics trauma unit hospital. Volunteers were stratified into novice, intermediate and expert groups based on self-reported levels of experience. Each participant carried out a simulated proximal femoral nail on an immersive virtual platform following instruction on its use, with objective metrics such as time and x-rays, and novel metrics calculated by the simulation module recorded. Face validity was also assessed. Result(s): The proximal femoral nail module demonstrated construct validity. Kruskal Wallis test demonstrated a statistically significant difference across all group's novel performance (p=.018). Intermediate surgeons performed significantly better than novices (P=.022), with shorter procedural times (P=.018) Three of the intermediate group achieved the proficiency level set by the expert group, with no significant difference noted between these two groups (=.06). Time taken to completion for expert surgeons was less than intermediate group, although this did not reach significance (P=.19). Conclusion(s): The proximal femoral nail module on the Precision OS platform demonstrated good face, and construct validity. Further research evaluating use of virtual platform simulation in surgical trauma training is needed.

Comparative study of a simulated incident with multiple victims and immersive virtual reality,"Ferrandini Price, M.; Escribano Tortosa, D.; Nieto Fernandez-Pacheco, A.; Perez Alonso, N.; Ceron Madrigal, J. J.; Melendreras-Ruiz, R.; Garcia-Collado, A. J.; Pardo Rios, M.; Juguera Rodriguez, L.","OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the study is to determine the efficiency in the execution of the START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) triage, comparing Virtual Reality (VR) to Clinical Simulation (CS) in a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI). The secondary objective is to determine the stress produced in the health professionals in the two situations described. MATERIALS: A comparative study on the efficiency and the stress during triage in a MSI was conducted. The basal and post levels of salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) activity were measured in all the participants before and after the simulation. RESULT(S): The percentage of victims that were triaged correctly was 87.65% (SD=8.3); 88.3% (SD=9.65) for the Clinical Simulation with Actors (CSA) group and 87.2% (SD=7.2) for the Virtual Reality Simulation (VRG) group, without any significant differences (p=0.612) between both groups. The basal sAA was 103.26 (SD=79.13) U/L with a significant increase (p<0.001) with respect to the post-simulation levels (182.22, SD=148.65U/L). The increase of sAA was 80.70 (SD=109.67) U/mL, being greater for the CSA group than the VRG group. CONCLUSION(S): The results show that virtual reality method is as efficient as clinical simulation for training on the execution of basic triage (START model). Also, based on the sAA results, we can attest that clinical simulation creates a more stressful training experience for the student, so that is should not be substituted by the use of virtual reality, although the latter could be used as a complementary activity.

Royal college of ophthalmologists' national ophthalmology database study of cataract surgery: Report 6. the impact of eyesi virtual reality training on complications rates of cataract surgery performed by first and second year trainees,"Ferris, J. D.; Donachie, P. H.; Johnston, R. L.; Barnes, B.; Olaitan, M.; Sparrow, J. M.","Objective To investigate the impact of EyeSi surgical simulators on posterior capsule rupture (PCR) rates of cataract surgery performed by first and second year trainee surgeons. Design A Royal College of Ophthalmologists' National Ophthalmology Database audit study of first and second year surgeons' PCR rates over seven consecutive National Health Service (NHS) years. Participating centres were contacted to ascertain the date when their surgeons had access to an EyeSi machine and whether this was on-site or off-site. Operations were classified as before, after or no access to EyeSi. Setting The study took place in 29 NHS Ophthalmology Units in a secondary care setting. Results Two-hundred and sixty five first and second year trainee surgeons performed 17 831 cataract operations. 6919 (38.8%) operations were performed before access to an EyeSi, 8648 (48.5%) after access to an EyeSi and 2264 (12.7%) operations by surgeons with no access to an EyeSi. Overall, there was a 38% reduction in the first and second year surgeon's unadjusted PCR rates from 4.2% in 2009 to 2.6% in 2015 for surgeons with access to an EyeSi, and a 3% reduction from 2.9% to 2.8% for surgeons without access to an EyeSi. The overall first and second year unadjusted PCR rates for before, after and no access to EyeSi were 3.5%, 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively. The decrease in the with-access to an EyeSi group PCR rate was similar for surgeons with access to an EyeSi 'on site' or 'off site'. Conclusions First and second year trainee surgeons' unadjusted PCR rates have decreased since 2009 which has significant benefits for patients undergoing cataract surgery. This 38% reduction in complication rates aligns with the introduction of EyeSi simulator training. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

Nursing students' experiences of virtual simulation when using a video conferencing system - a mixed methods study,"Flo, J.; Byermoen, K. R.; Egilsdottir, H. O.; Eide, H.; Heyn, L. G.","OBJECTIVES: There is limited knowledge about students' experiences with virtual simulation when using a video conferencing system. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore how second-year undergraduate nursing students experienced learning through virtual simulations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): The study had an exploratory design with both quantitative and qualitative approaches. In total, 69 nursing students participated in two sessions of virtual simulation during spring 2020, and 33 students answered online questionnaires at session 1. To further explore students' experiences, one focus group interview and one individual interview were conducted using a video conferencing system after session 2. In addition, system information on use during both sessions was collected. RESULT(S): Changes in the students' ratings of their experiences of virtual simulation with the Body InteractTM system were statistically significant. The virtual simulation helped them to bridge gaps in both the teaching and learning processes. Four important aspects of learning were identified: 1) learning by self-training, 2) learning from the software (Body InteractTM), 3) learning from peers, and 4) learning from faculty. CONCLUSION(S): We conclude that virtual simulation through a video conferencing system can be useful for student learning and feedback from both peers and faculty is important.

Augmented Reality for Guideline Presentation in Medicine: Randomized Crossover Simulation Trial for Technically Assisted Decision-making,"Follmann, A.; Ruhl, A.; Gosch, M.; Felzen, M.; Rossaint, R.; Czaplik, M.","BACKGROUND: Guidelines provide instructions for diagnostics and therapy in modern medicine. Various mobile devices are used to represent the potential complex decision trees. An example of time-critical decisions is triage in case of a mass casualty incident. OBJECTIVE(S): In this randomized controlled crossover study, the potential of augmented reality for guideline presentation was evaluated and compared with the guideline presentation provided in a tablet PC as a conventional device. METHOD(S): A specific Android app was designed for use with smart glasses and a tablet PC for the presentation of a triage algorithm as an example for a complex guideline. Forty volunteers simulated a triage based on 30 fictional patient descriptions, each with technical support from smart glasses and a tablet PC in a crossover trial design. The time to come to a decision and the accuracy were recorded and compared between both devices. RESULT(S): A total of 2400 assessments were performed by the 40 volunteers. A significantly faster time to triage was achieved in total with the tablet PC (median 12.8 seconds, IQR 9.4-17.7; 95% CI 14.1-14.9) compared to that to triage with smart glasses (median 17.5 seconds, IQR 13.2-22.8, 95% CI 18.4-19.2; P=.001). Considering the difference in the triage time between both devices, the additional time needed with the smart glasses could be reduced significantly in the course of assessments (21.5 seconds, IQR 16.5-27.3, 95% CI 21.6-23.2) in the first run, 17.4 seconds (IQR 13-22.4, 95% CI 17.6-18.9) in the second run, and 14.9 seconds (IQR 11.7-18.6, 95% CI 15.2-16.3) in the third run (P=.001). With regard to the accuracy of the guideline decisions, there was no significant difference between both the devices. CONCLUSION(S): The presentation of a guideline on a tablet PC as well as through augmented reality achieved good results. The implementation with smart glasses took more time owing to their more complex operating concept but could be accelerated in the course of the study after adaptation. Especially in a non-time-critical working area where hands-free interfaces are useful, a guideline presentation with augmented reality can be of great use during clinical management.

"Developing the Virtual Resus Room: Fidelity, Usability, Acceptability, and Applicability of a Virtual Simulation for Teaching and Learning","Foohey, S.; Nagji, A.; Yilmaz, Y.; Sibbald, M.; Monteiro, S.; Chan, T. M.","PROBLEM: Physical distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic led to the transition from in-person to online teaching for many medical educators. This report describes the Virtual Resus Room (VRR)-a free, novel, open-access resource for running collaborative online simulations. APPROACH: The lead author created the VRR in May 2020 to give learners the opportunity to rehearse their crisis resource management skills by working as a team to complete virtual tasks. The VRR uses Google Slides to link participants to the virtual environment and Zoom to link participants to each other. Students and facilitators in the emergency medicine clerkship at McMaster University used the VRR to run 2 cases between June and August 2020. Students and facilitators completed a postsession survey to assess usability and acceptability, applicability for learning or teaching, and fidelity. In addition, students took a knowledge test pre- and postsession. OUTCOME(S): Forty-six students and 11 facilitators completed the postsession surveys. Facilitators and students rated the VRR's usability and acceptability, applicability for learning and teaching, and fidelity highly. Students showed a significant improvement in their postsession (mean = 89.06, standard deviation [SD] = 9.56) compared with their presession knowledge scores (mean = 71.17, SD = 15.77; t(34) = 7.28, P < .001, with a large effect size Cohen's d = 1.23). Two perceived learning outcomes were identified: content learning and communication skills development. The total time spent (in minutes) facilitating VRR simulations (mean = 119, SD = 36) was significantly lower than time spent leading in-person simulations (mean = 181, SD = 58; U = 20.50, P < .008). NEXT STEPS: Next steps will include expanding the evaluation of the VRR to include participants from additional learner levels, from varying sites, and from other health professions.

Simulation of advanced cataract surgery - validation of a newly developed test,"Forslund Jacobsen, M.; Konge, L.; la Cour, M.; Holm, L.; Kjaerbo, H.; Moldow, B.; Saleh, G. M.; Thomsen, A. S. S.","Purpose: To develop and investigate an Eyesi simulator-based test for the more experienced cataract surgeon for evidence of validity. Method(s): The study was a prospective interventional cohort study and carried out at the Copenhagen Academy for Medical Education and Simulation. The Eyesi Simulator was used for the test which was developed by three expert cataract surgeons. Ten cataract surgeons (>250 surgeries performed) and ten ophthalmic residents performed two repetitions of the test. The test consisted of four modules: Iris Expansion Ring insertion - level 1, Iris Expansion Ring extraction - level 2, Capsulorhexis - level 3 and Anterior Vitrectomy - level 6. Result(s): Internal consistency reliability showed Cronbach's alpha of 0.63. Test-retest reliabilities were significant for Iris Expansion Ring extraction - level 2 (p = 0.012) and Capsulorhexis - level 3 (p = 0.018). Differences between the two groups were only significant in both repetitions for the Iris Expansion Ring extraction - level 2 (p < 0.001 and p = 0.041, respectively). Furthermore, we found a statistically significant difference between the mean module scores for novices and the more experienced surgeons for Iris Expansion Ring insertion - level 1 (p = 0.021) and Capsulorhexis - level 3 (p = 0.019) in the first repetition. Conclusion(s): The investigated modules show evidence of validity within several aspects of Messick's framework. However, the evidence is not strong enough to apply the test for certification purposes of cataract surgeons, but the modules may still be relevant in the training of advanced cataract surgical procedures.

Virtual morality in the helping professions: Simulated action and resilience,"Francis, K. B.; Gummerum, M.; Ganis, G.; Howard, I. S.; Terbeck, S.","Recent advances in virtual technologies have allowed the investigation of simulated moral actions in aversive moral dilemmas. Previous studies have employed diverse populations to explore these actions, with little research considering the significance of occupation on moral decision-making. For the first time, in this study we have investigated simulated moral actions in virtual reality made by professionally trained paramedics and fire service incident commanders who are frequently faced with and must respond to moral dilemmas. We found that specially trained individuals showed distinct empathic and related personality trait scores and that these declined with years of experience working in the profession. Supporting the theory that these professionals develop resilience in moral conflict, reduced emotional arousal was observed during virtual simulations of a distressing dilemma. Furthermore, trained professionals demonstrated less regret following the execution of a moral action in virtual reality when compared to untrained control populations. We showed that, contrary to previous research, trained individuals made the same moral judgements and moral actions as untrained individuals, though showing less arousal and regret. In the face of increasing concerns regarding empathy decline in health care professionals, we suggest that the nature of this decline is complex and likely reflects the development of a necessary emotional resilience to distressing events.

Instrument Motion Metrics for Laparoscopic Skills Assessment in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality,"Fransson, B. A.; Chen, C. Y.; Noyes, J. A.; Ragle, C. A.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the construct and concurrent validity of instrument motion metrics for laparoscopic skills assessment in virtual reality and augmented reality simulators. STUDY DESIGN: Evaluation study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Veterinarian students (novice, n=14) and veterinarians (experienced, n=11) with no or variable laparoscopic experience. METHODS: Participants' minimally invasive surgery (MIS) experience was determined by hospital records of MIS procedures performed in the Teaching Hospital. Basic laparoscopic skills were assessed by 5 tasks using a physical box trainer. Each participant completed 2 tasks for assessments in each type of simulator (virtual reality: bowel handling and cutting; augmented reality: object positioning and a pericardial window model). Motion metrics such as instrument path length, angle or drift, and economy of motion of each simulator were recorded. RESULTS: None of the motion metrics in a virtual reality simulator showed correlation with experience, or to the basic laparoscopic skills score. All metrics in augmented reality were significantly correlated with experience (time, instrument path, and economy of movement), except for the hand dominance metric. The basic laparoscopic skills score was correlated to all performance metrics in augmented reality. The augmented reality motion metrics differed between American College of Veterinary Surgeons diplomates and residents, whereas basic laparoscopic skills score and virtual reality metrics did not.

Cognitive load and performance in immersive virtual reality versus conventional virtual reality simulation training of laparoscopic surgery: a randomized trial,"Frederiksen, J. G.; Sorensen, S. M. D.; Konge, L.; Svendsen, M. B. S.; Nobel-Jorgensen, M.; Bjerrum, F.; Andersen, S. A. W.","Background: Virtual reality simulators combined with head-mounted displays enable highly immersive virtual reality (VR) for surgical skills training, potentially bridging the gap between the simulation environment and real-life operating room conditions. However, the increased complexity of the learning situation in immersive VR could potentially induce high cognitive load thereby inhibiting performance and learning. This study aims to compare cognitive load and performance in immersive VR and conventional VR simulation training. Method(s): A randomized controlled trial of residents (n = 31) performing laparoscopic salpingectomies with an ectopic pregnancy in either immersive VR or conventional VR simulation. Cognitive load was estimated by secondary-task reaction time at baseline, and during nonstressor and stressor phases of the procedure. Simulator metrics were used to evaluate performance. Result(s): Cognitive load was increased by 66% and 58% during immersive VR and conventional VR simulation, respectively (p < 0.001), compared to baseline. A light stressor induced a further increase in cognitive load by 15.2% and a severe stressor by 43.1% in the immersive VR group compared to 23% (severe stressor) in the conventional VR group. Immersive VR also caused a significantly worse performance on most simulator metrics. Conclusion(s): Immersive VR simulation training induces a higher cognitive load and results in a poorer performance than conventional VR simulation training in laparoscopy. High extraneous load and element interactivity in the immersive VR are suggested as mechanisms explaining this finding. However, immersive VR offers some potential advantages over conventional VR such as more real-life conditions but we only recommend introducing immersive VR in surgical skills training after initial training in conventional VR.

"Cochlear Implant Surgery: Virtual Reality Simulation Training and Transfer of Skills to Cadaver Dissection-A Randomized, Controlled Trial","Frendo, M.; Frithioff, A.; Konge, L.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Sorensen, M. S.; Wuyts Andersen, S. A.","BACKGROUND: Cochlear implantation requires excellent surgical skills; virtual reality simulation training is an effective method for acquiring basic competency in temporal bone surgery before progression to cadaver dissection. However, cochlear implantation virtual reality simulation training remains largely unexplored and only one simulator currently supports the training of the cochlear implantation electrode insertion. Here, we aim to evaluate the effect of cochlear implantation virtual reality simulation training on subsequent cadaver dissection performance and self-directedness. METHOD(S): This was a randomized, controlled trial. Eighteen otolaryngology residents were randomized to either mastoidectomy including cochlear implantation virtual reality simulation training (intervention) or mastoidectomy virtual reality simulation training alone (controls) before cadaver cochlear implantation surgery. Surgical performance was evaluated by two blinded expert raters using a validated, structured assess- ment tool. The need for supervision (reflecting self-directedness) was assessed via post-dissection questionnaires. RESULT(S): The intervention group achieved a mean score of 22.9 points of a maximum of 44 points, which was 5.4% higher than the control group's 21.8 points (P = .51). On average, the intervention group required assistance 1.3 times during cadaver drilling; this was 41% more frequent in the control group who received assistance 1.9 times (P = .21). CONCLUSION(S): Cochlear implantation virtual reality simulation training is feasible in the context of a cadaver dissection course. The addition of cochlear implantation virtual reality training to basic mastoidectomy virtual reality simulation training did not lead to a significant improvement of performance or self-directedness in this study. Our findings suggest that learning an advanced temporal bone procedure such as cochlear implantation surgery requires much more training than learning mastoidectomy.",2022,1-May,The journal of international advanced otology,18(3),,219-224,638074979,,,#1603,Frendo 2022,,
Assessing competence in cochlear implant surgery using the newly developed Cochlear Implant Surgery Assessment Tool,"Frendo, M.; Frithioff, A.; Konge, L.; Foghsgaard, S.; Mikkelsen, P. T.; Sorensen, M. S.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Andersen, S. A. W.","Purpose: To develop and gather validity evidence for a novel tool for assessment of cochlear implant (CI) surgery, including virtual reality CI surgery training. Method(s): Prospective study gathering validity evidence according to Messick's framework. Four experts developed the CI Surgery Assessment Tool (CISAT). A total of 35 true novices (medical students), trained novices (residents) and CI surgeons performed two CI-procedures each in the Visible Ear Simulator, which were rated by three blinded experts. Classical test theory and generalizability theory were used for reliability analysis. Result(s): The CISAT significantly discriminated between the three groups (p < 0.001). The generalizability coefficient was 0.76 and most of the score variance (53.3%) was attributable to the participant and only 6.8% to the raters. When exploring a standard setting for CI surgery, the contrasting groups method suggested a pass/fail score of 36.0 points (out of 55), but since the trained novices performed above this, we propose using the mean CI surgeon performance score (45.3 points). Conclusion(s): Validity evidence for simulation-based assessment of CI performance supports the CISAT. Together with the standard setting, the CISAT might be used to monitor progress in competency-based training of CI surgery and to determine when the trainee can advance to further training.

"Decentralized Virtual Reality Training of Mastoidectomy Improves Cadaver Dissection Performance: A Prospective, Controlled Cohort Study","Frendo, M.; Konge, L.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Sorensen, M. S.; Andersen, S. A. W.","OBJECTIVE: Virtual reality (VR) simulation training can improve temporal bone (TB) cadaver dissection skills and distributed, self-regulated practice is optimal for skills consolidation. Decentralized training (DT) at the trainees' own department or home offers more convenient access compared with centralized VR simulation training where the simulators are localized at one facility. The effect of DT in TB surgical training is unknown. We investigated the effect of decentralized VR simulation training of TB surgery on subsequent cadaver dissection performance.

PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight ORL residents: 20 in the intervention cohort (decentralized training) and 18 in the control cohort (standard training during course). INTERVENTION: Three months of access to decentralized VR simulation training at the local ORL department or the trainee's home. A freeware VR simulator (the visible ear simulator [VES]) was used, supplemented by a range of learning supports for directed, self-regulated learning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mastoidectomy final-product scores from the VR simulations and cadaver dissection were rated using a modified Welling Scale by blinded expert raters.

"Decentralized virtual reality mastoidectomy simulation training: a prospective, mixed-methods study","Frendo, M.; Thingaard, E.; Konge, L.; Sorensen, M. S.; Andersen, S. A. W.","Purpose: Virtual reality (VR) training of mastoidectomy is effective in surgical training-particularly if organized as distributed practice. However, centralization of practice facilities is a barrier to implementation of distributed simulation training. Decentralized training could be a potential solution. Here, we aim to assess the feasibility, use, and barriers to decentralized VR mastoidectomy training using a freeware, high-fidelity temporal bone simulator. Method(s): In a prospective, mixed-methods study, 20 otorhinolaryngology residents were given three months of local access to a VR mastoidectomy simulator. Additionally, trainees were provided a range of learning supports for directed, self-regulated learning. Questionnaire data were collected and focus group interviews conducted. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis and compared with quantitative findings. Result(s): Participants trained 48.5 h combined and mainly towards the end of the trial. Most participants used between two and four different learning supports. Qualitative analysis revealed five main themes regarding implementation of decentralized simulation training: convenience, time for training, ease of use, evidence for training, and testing. Conclusion(s): Decentralized VR training using a freeware, high-fidelity mastoidectomy simulator is feasible but did not lead to a high training volume or truly distributed practice. Evidence for training was found motivational. Access to training, educational designs, and the role of testing are important for participant motivation and require further evaluation.

Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial on a multimodal training curriculum for laparoscopic cholecystectomy - LapTrain,"Friedrich, M.; Kowalewski, K. F.; Proctor, T.; Garrow, C.; Preukschas, A. A.; Kenngott, H. G.; Fischer, L.; Muller-Stich, B. P.; Nickel, F.","Background Although minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has replaced many open procedures in visceral surgery, technical and psychomotor obstacles remain a constant challenge for surgeons and trainees. However, there are various training curricula enabling surgeons to acquire the visuospatial and psychomotor abilities additionally required when performing MIS. Currently accepted training modalities include box-trainers, organ and animal models as well as completely simulated training environments, realized in virtual reality (VR) trainers. All of these methods facilitate an adequate training prior to patient contact, so patient safety can benefit as well. This study aims to evaluate the benefit of a structured multi-modality laparoscopy training curriculum. Methods Junior and senior surgical residents are included (n = 60). Groups are stratified with concern to previous experience and training of participants. The training curriculum consists of a standardized sequence of available modalities and exercises on box- and VR-trainers. Specific consideration applies to the training effect during the repeated performance of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) between intervention (training in between LCs) and control group (no training in between LCs). Analysis of training effects is performed using a cadaveric model for LC and objectified using the validated scoring system Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS). Discussion This study assesses the value of a multimodal training platform in medical education and postgraduate training and aims at illustrating possible guidelines when establishing such a curriculum. Possible factors of influence, such as varying backgrounds, learning motivation and -success among participants are explored in the data analysis and add beneficially to further evaluating the efficacy of such training to more heterogeneous participant groups like medical students and other professionals.

Cochlear implantation: Exploring the effects of 3D stereovision in a digital microscope for virtual reality simulation training - A randomized controlled trial,"Frithioff, A.; Frendo, M.; Mikkelsen, P. T.; Sorensen, M. S.; Andersen, S. A. W.","In cochlear implantation (CI), excellent surgical technique is critical for hearing outcomes. Recent advances in temporal bone Virtual Reality (VR) training allow for specific training of CI and through introduction of new digital microscopes with ultra-high-fidelity (UHF) graphics. This study aims to investigate whether UHF increases performance in VR simulation training of CI electrode insertion compared with conventional, screen-based VR (cVR). METHOD(S): Twenty-four medical students completed a randomized, controlled trial of an educational intervention. They performed a total of eight CI electrode insertions each in blocks of four using either UHF-VR or cVR, in randomized order. CI electrode insertion performances were rated by two blinded expert raters using a structured assessment tool supported by validity evidence. RESULT(S): Performance scores in cVR were higher than in the UHF-VR simulation although this was not significant (19.8 points, 95% CI [19.3-20.3] vs. 18.8 points, 95% CI [18.2-19.4]; P=0.09). The decisive factor for performance was participants' ability to achieve stereovision (mean difference=1.1 points, 95% CI [0.15-2.08], P=0.02). DISCUSSION: No additional benefit was found from UHF-VR over cVR training of CI electrode insertion for novices. Consequently, standard cVR simulation should be used for novices' basic skills acquisition in CI surgery. Future studies should instead explore the effects of other improvements in CI surgery training and if the lacking benefit of UHF-VR also applies for more experienced learners. CONCLUSION(S): The increased graphical perception and the superior lifelikeness of UHF-VR does not improve early skills acquisition of CI insertion for novices.",2022,1-Mar,Cochlear implants international,23(2),,80-86,636838039,,,#1613,Frithioff 2022,,
Automated summative feedback improves performance and retention in simulation training of mastoidectomy: a randomised controlled trial,"Frithioff, A.; Frendo, M.; Von Buchwald, J. H.; Mikkelsen, P. T.; Sorensen, M. S.; Andersen, S. A.

Method Twenty-four medical students were randomised in two groups and performed 15 mastoidectomies on a distributed virtual reality simulator as practice. The intervention group received additional summative metrics-based feedback; the control group followed standard instructions. Two to three months after training, participants performed a retention test without learning supports. Results The intervention group had a better final-product score (mean difference = 1.0 points; p = 0.001) and metrics-based score (mean difference = 12.7; p < 0.001). At retention, the metrics-based score for the intervention group remained superior (mean difference = 6.9 per cent; p = 0.02). Also at the retention, cognitive load was higher in the intervention group (mean difference = 10.0 per cent; p < 0.001). Conclusion Summative metrics-based feedback improved performance and lead to a safer and faster performance compared with standard instructions and seems a valuable educational tool in the early acquisition of temporal bone skills.

Characterizing the learning curve of a virtual intracorporeal suturing simulator VBLaST-SS©,"Fu, Y.; Cavuoto, L.; Qi, D.; Panneerselvam, K.; Arikatla, V. S.; Enquobahrie, A.; De, S.; Schwaitzberg, S. D.","Background: The virtual basic laparoscopic skill trainer suturing simulator (VBLaST-SS©) was developed to simulate the intracorporeal suturing task in the FLS program. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the training effectiveness and participants' learning curves on the VBLaST-SS© and to assess whether the skills were retained after 2 weeks without training. Method(s): Fourteen medical students participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to two training groups (7 per group): VBLaST-SS© or FLS, based on the modality of training. Participants practiced on their assigned system for one session (30 min or up to ten repetitions) a day, 5 days a week for three consecutive weeks. Their baseline, post-test, and retention (after 2 weeks) performance were also analyzed. Participants' performance scores were calculated based on the original FLS scoring system. The cumulative summation (CUSUM) method was used to evaluate learning. Two-way mixed factorial ANOVA was used to compare the effects of group, time point (baseline, post-test, and retention), and their interaction on performance. Result(s): Six out of seven participants in each group reached the predefined proficiency level after 7 days of training. Participants' performance improved significantly (p < 0.001) after training within their assigned group. The CUSUM learning curve shows that one participant in each group achieved 5% failure rate by the end of the training period. Twelve out of fourteen participants' CUSUM curves showed a negative trend toward achieving the 5% failure rate after further training. Conclusion(s): The VBLaST-SS© is effective in training laparoscopic suturing skill.

Use of 360degree Video for a Virtual Operating Theatre Orientation for Medical Students,"Fukuta, J.; Gill, N.; Rooney, R.; Coombs, A.; Murphy, D.","Background: Operating theatres are a unique learning environment that some learners find daunting. By employing orientations some of these fears can be reduced but these require operating theatre space and personnel and are not standardized. Method(s): We utilized a 360degree camera to generate a ""virtual"" 360degree video orientation. It was filmed in first-person perspective to improve engagement and to make it more experiential. Evaluation: It was shown to 34 medical students in a tutorial setting before their first operating theatre experience. We analyzed their knowledge gain with use of a questionnaire and change in self-reported confidence using a 7-point Likert scale. The students' knowledge improved from 38.4% to 78.2% (p < 0.01) as well as self-reported confidence from 4.3 to 6.1 (p < 0.01). Discussion(s): The use of 360degree video for a virtual operating theatre orientation improved knowledge and confidence of learners which suggests its expanded use in medical education.

Impact of mixed reality application on the learning curve of laparoscopic nephrectomy. [Russian],"Gabdullin, A. F.; Pogosyan, R. R.; Dzhalilov, I. B.; Gadzhiev, N. K.; Semeniakin, I. V.","Aim - to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of mixed reality (MR) in surgeon's learning curve for laparoscopic nephrectomy (LNE). Material and methods. There were 40 prospectively recruited patients that have undergone LNE; in 20 patients, the results of contrast-enhanced multislice computed tomography of the urinary system (MSCT US) were converted to MR models. The MR platform allowed surgeons to rotate and disassemble the anatomy of the kidneys during the preoperative phase, as well as directly during the surgery; patients could also see their anatomical structures while having the surgical procedure explained step-by-step. The Likert scale questionnaire allowed to assesse the understanding and usefulness of the MR model in anatomical kidney surgery. The surgeons involved in the study also commented on whether MR affected their learning curve. Surgical outcomes for the MR patient cohort were compared with a prospectively matched cohort of LNE patients without MR. Results. The mean operative time in the MR group was significantly lower than in the non-MR group (78.5 versus 95.6 min; p<0.05). The differences in the indices of intraoperative blood loss were 58 versus 150 ml (p=0.081). Postoperative complications 5 versus 15% (p=0.09) for the MR group and the non-MR group, respectively. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the 2 groups (72+/-4 versus 48+/-5 hours, p=0.01). The novice surgeon reached a plateau after 20 surgical procedures. Conclusion. The preoperative review of MR models changed the on-line approach, shortened surgery time, and improved LNE results. The implementation of mixed reality technology in the course of teaching the technique of laparoscopic nephrectomy demonstrated positive results in terms of the speed of reaching the plateau of surgical procedures without any complications. The process of preparing and using a volumetric model of an organ in the course of LNE training did not cause difficulties for specialists, and lead to an acceleration of operation in the technique training without loss of quality.

Outlier experienced surgeon's performances impact on benchmark for technical surgical skills training,"Gallagher, A. G.; Henn, P. J.; Neary, P. C.; Senagore, A. J.; Marcello, P. W.; Bunting, B. P.; Seymour, N. E.; Satava, R. M.","BACKGROUND: Training in medicine must move to an outcome-based approach. A proficiency-based progression outcome approach to training relies on a quantitative estimation of experienced operator performance. We aimed to develop a method for dealing with atypical expert performances in the quantitative definition of surgical proficiency. METHOD(S): In study one, 100 experienced laparoscopic surgeons' performances on virtual reality and box-trainer simulators were assessed for two similar laparoscopic tasks. In study two, 15 experienced surgeons and 16 trainee colorectal surgeons performed one simulated hand-assisted laparoscopic colorectal procedure. Performance scores of experienced surgeons in both studies were standardized (i.e. Z-scores) using the mean and standard deviations (SDs). Performances >1.96 SDs from the mean were excluded in proficiency definitions. RESULT(S): In study one, 1-5% of surgeons' performances were excluded having performed significantly below their colleagues. Excluded surgeons made significantly fewer correct incisions (mean=7 (SD=2) versus 19.42 (SD=4.6), P<0.0001) and a greater proportion of incorrect incisions (mean=45.71 (SD=10.48) versus 5.25 (SD=6.6), P<0.0001). In study two, one experienced colorectal surgeon performance was >4 SDs for time to complete the procedure and >6 SDs for path length. After their exclusions, experienced surgeons' performances were significantly better than trainees for path length: P=0.031 and for time: P=0.002.

Subjective and objective quantification of the effect of distraction on physician's workload and performance during simulated laparoscopic surgery,"Gao, J.; Liu, S.; Feng, Q.; Zhang, X.; Jiang, M.; Wang, L.; Zhang, J.; Zhang, Q.","Background: Distracting interference cognitive tasks place undeniable pressure on the minds of people who need high precision and attention during the tasks, such as those tasks performed during surgery; these tasks might affect current surgical procedures. We measured the effect of additional cognitive tasks on the mental load of the physician by measuring the mean change in pupil size, blink rate, and subjective assessment during surgery. Material/Methods: We recruited 24 participants with different levels of laparoscopic surgery to perform a complete appendectomy using a standardized virtual reality laparoscopic surgery simulator. The participants then performed the cognitive task (arithmetic problem), after that they performed an appendectomy surgery task while completing the cognitive task on the simulator. All participants wore trackers to monitor pupil size and blink rate during surgery and the cognitive task. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Task Load Index (TLX) score also recorded performance parameters during the surgical mission. Result(s): The double-task pupil size and the blink rate were significantly increased compared to the single-task observation, and the associated increase in psychological load might have been affected by surgical performance, and the performance parameters were also statistically significant. However, for the aforementioned parameters, experienced surgeons had some differences compared with inexperienced surgeons, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion(s): Distracted cognitive task stimulation in the operating room can increase the surgeon's psychological burden while also affecting their operational skills, thereby threatening patient safety; reduced cognitive costs might be obtained by improving or managing cognitive deficits.

Virtual<sup>CPR</sup>: Virtual Reality Mobile Application for Training in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Techniques,"Garcia Fierros, F. J.; Moreno Escobar, J. J.; Sepulveda Cervantes, G.; Morales Matamoros, O.; Tejeida Padilla, R.","Deaths due to heart diseases are a leading cause of death in Mexico. Cardiovascular diseases are considered a public health problem because they produce cardiorespiratory arrests. During an arrest, cardiac and/or respiratory activity stops. A cardiorespiratory arrest is rapidly fatal without a quick and efficient intervention. As a response to this problem, the VirtualCPR system was designed in the present work. VirtualCPR is a mobile virtual reality application to support learning and practicing of basic techniques of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for experts or non-experts in CPR. VirtualCPR implements an interactive virtual scenario with the user, which is visible by means of employment of virtual reality lenses. User's interactions, with our proposal, are by a portable force sensor for integration with training mannequins, whose development is based on an application for the Android platform. Furthermore, this proposal integrates medical knowledge in first aid, related to the basic CPR for adults using only the hands, as well as technological knowledge, related to development of simulations on a mobile virtual reality platform by three main processes: (i) force measurement and conversion, (ii) data transmission and (iii) simulation of a virtual scenario. An experiment by means of a multifactorial analysis of variance was designed considering four factors for a CPR session: (i) previous training in CPR, (ii) frequency of compressions, (iii) presence of auditory suggestions and (iv) presence of color indicator. Our findings point out that the more previous training in CPR a user of the VirtualCPR system has, the greater the percentage of correct compressions obtained from a virtual CPR session. Setting the rate to 100 or 150 compressions per minute, turning on or off the auditory suggestions and turning the color indicator on or off during the session have no significant effect on the results obtained by the user.",2021,,Sensors,21,7,,634923802,,,#1684,GarciaFierros 2021,,
Validation of the updated ArthroS simulator: face and construct validity of a passive haptic virtual reality simulator with novel performance metrics,"Garfjeld Roberts, P.; Guyver, P.; Baldwin, M.; Akhtar, K.; Alvand, A.; Price, A. J.; Rees, J. L.","PURPOSE: To assess the construct and face validity of ArthroS, a passive haptic VR simulator. A secondary aim was to evaluate the novel performance metrics produced by this simulator. METHODS: Two groups of 30 participants, each divided into novice, intermediate or expert based on arthroscopic experience, completed three separate tasks on either the knee or shoulder module of the simulator. Performance was recorded using 12 automatically generated performance metrics and video footage of the arthroscopic procedures. The videos were blindly assessed using a validated global rating scale (GRS). Participants completed a survey about the simulator's realism and training utility. RESULTS: This new simulator demonstrated construct validity of its tasks when evaluated against a GRS (p <= 0.003 in all cases). Regarding it's automatically generated performance metrics, established outputs such as time taken (p <= 0.001) and instrument path length (p <= 0.007) also demonstrated good construct validity. However, two-thirds of the proposed 'novel metrics' the simulator reports could not distinguish participants based on arthroscopic experience. Face validity assessment rated the simulator as a realistic and useful tool for trainees, but the passive haptic feedback (a key feature of this simulator) is rated as less realistic. CONCLUSION: The ArthroS simulator has good task construct validity based on established objective outputs, but some of the novel performance metrics could not distinguish between surgical experience. The passive haptic feedback of the simulator also needs improvement. If simulators could offer automated and validated performance feedback, this would facilitate improvements in the delivery of training by allowing trainees to practise and self-assess.",2017,1-Feb,"Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA",25(2),,616-625,616753098,,,#1699,GarfjeldRoberts 2017,,
Can Virtual Reality Be as Good as Operating Room Training? Experience from a Residency Program in General Surgery,"Gasperin, B. D. M.; Zanirati, T.; Cavazzola, L. T.","BACKGROUND: The increasingly intense usage of technology applied to videosurgery and the advent of robotic platforms accelerated the use of virtual models in training surgical skills. AIM: To evaluate the performance of a general surgery department's residents in a video-simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy in order to understand whether training with virtual reality is sufficient to provide the skills that are normally acquired in hands-on experience at the operating room. METHOD(S): An observational study with twenty-five first- and second-year general surgery residents. Each subject performed three video-laparoscopic cholecystectomies under supervision in a simulator. Only the best performance was evaluated in the study. Total number of complications and total procedure time were evaluated independently. The groups were defined according to total practice time (G1 and G2) and the year of residency (R1 and R2), each being analysed separately. RESULT(S): Twenty-one residents finished the three practices, with four follow-up losses. Mean practice time was 33.5 hours. Lowering of the rate of lesions in important structures could be identified after a level of proficiency of 60%, which all participants obtained regardless of previous in vivo experience. No significant difference between the R1 and R2 groups was observed. CONCLUSION(S): Learning in groups R1 and R2 was equal, regardless of whether previous practice was predominantly in vivo (R2) or with virtual reality (R1). Therefore, it is possible to consider that skills obtained in virtual reality training are capable of equalising the proficiency of first- and second-year residents, being invaluable to increase patient safety and homogenise learning of basic surgical procedures.",2018,6-Dec,Arquivos brasileiros de cirurgia digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian archives of digestive surgery,31(4),,e1397,625508064,,,#1702,Gasperin 2018,,
The impact of virtual reality training on the quality of real antromastoidectomy performance,"Gawecki, W.; Wegrzyniak, M.; Mickiewicz, P.; Gawlowska, M. B.; Talar, M.; Wierzbicka, M.","Background: The aim of this paper is to analyze the results of virtual reality (VR) antromastoidectomy simulation training and the transferability of the obtained skills to real temporal bone surgery. Method(s): The study was conducted prospectively on a group of 10 physicians, and was composed of five VR simulation training sessions followed by live temporal bone surgery. The quality of performance was evaluated with a Task-Based Checklist (TBC) prepared by John Hopkins Hospital. Additionally, during every VR session, the number and type of mistakes (complications) were noted. Result(s): The quality of performance measured by the TBC increased significantly during consecutive VR sessions. The mean scores for the first and fifth sessions were 1.84 and 4.27, respectively (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the number of mistakes in consecutive VR sessions was gradually reduced from 11 to 0. During supervised surgery, all the participants were able to perform at least part of an antromastoidectomy, and the mean TBC score was 3.57. There was a significant strong positive correlation between the individual results of the fifth VR session and the individual results of supervised surgery in the operating room (r<inf>p</inf> = 0.89, p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Virtual reality for temporal bone training makes it possible to acquire surgical skills in a safe environment before performing supervised surgery. Furthermore, the individual final score of virtual antromastoidectomy training allows a prediction of the quality of performance in real surgery. Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

H. F.; Schwab, J. H.","BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing, especially with recent improvements in deep learning (DL) techniques. Augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are finding their place in healthcare, and spine surgery is no exception. The unique capabilities and advantages of AR and VR devices include their low cost, flexible integration with other technologies, user-friendly features and their application in navigation systems, which makes them beneficial across different aspects of spine surgery. Despite the use of AR for pedicle screw placement, targeted cervical foraminotomy, bone biopsy, osteotomy planning, and percutaneous intervention, the current applications of AR and VR in spine surgery remain limited. PURPOSE: The primary goal of this study was to provide the spine surgeons and clinical researchers with the general information about the current applications, future potentials, and accessibility of AR and VR systems in spine surgery. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: We reviewed titles of more than 250 journal papers from google scholar and PubMed with search words: augmented reality, virtual reality, spine surgery, and orthopaedic, out of which 89 related papers were selected for abstract review. Finally, full text of 67 papers were analyzed and reviewed. METHOD(S): The papers were divided into four groups: technological papers, applications in surgery, applications in spine education and training, and general application in orthopaedic. A team of two reviewers performed paper reviews and a thorough web search to ensure the most updated state of the art in each of four group is captured in the review. RESULT(S): In this review we discuss the current state of the art in AR and VR hardware, their preoperative applications and surgical applications in spine surgery. Finally, we discuss the future potentials of AR and VR and their integration with AI, robotic surgery, gaming, and wearables.

OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of this study was to describe the self-reported changes in knowledge and/or attitudes and planned behavior changes by healthcare workers for their future care of persons with challenges to their social determinants of health following completion of a first-person virtual reality experience. DESIGN: A descriptive qualitative design was used. SETTINGS: This study was conducted in clinics and private practice settings in Ohio (United States). PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted with 206 healthcare workers. METHOD(S): Participants completed a virtual reality simulation followed by qualitative, open-ended questions about changes to their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Responses were analyzed using a content analysis method. RESULT(S): Four overarching themes were derived from the qualitative data: (1) Acknowledgement of Social Determinants of Health, (2) An Improved Provider Experience for Patients, (3) Patient as a Person with Complex Needs, and (4) The Learning Experience. CONCLUSION(S): Findings suggest virtual reality has strong merits for impacting affective domain of learning demonstrated by increased empathy. Virtual reality along with increased empathy also helps improve attitudes and behaviors for the betterment of patients. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A pilot study to compare virtual reality to hybrid simulation for opioid-related overdose and naloxone training,"Giordano, N. A.; Whitney, C. E.; Axson, S. A.; Cassidy, K.; Rosado, E.; Hoyt-Brennan, A. M.","BACKGROUND: In the midst of the international opioid-related overdose (OOD) crisis, appropriate naloxone training is needed by both healthcare professionals and community members to better leverage its life-saving potential. OBJECTIVE(S): Pilot the use of a virtual reality simulation for training student nurses to identify signs and symptoms of an OOD, properly administer intranasal naloxone, and provide immediate recovery care after revival. DESIGN: This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study evaluated knowledge and attitudes towards intervening during an opioid-related overdose among student nurses before and after participating in a traditional hybrid simulation or virtual reality simulation. SETTING: A medium sized urban university's school of nursing in the Northeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty (N = 50) senior Bachelor of Nursing Science (BSN) students. METHOD(S): Knowledge and attitudes were assessed using the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) and Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS). Students completed measures 3 weeks prior to training and 3 weeks after. Appropriate t-tests evaluated changes in OOAS and OOKS scores both within and between training groups (e.g. hybrid simulation compared to virtual reality). RESULT(S): Sample characteristics were well balanced in both the hybrid simulation group (n = 31) and virtual reality group (n = 19). There were no statistically significant differences in average OOKS and OOAS scores at baseline or at follow up between those receiving hybrid simulation or the virtual reality training. All participants' attitudes scores decreased from baseline to follow up by <2 points. However, there was no difference in the change in knowledge scores between the training groups. CONCLUSION(S): Individuals participating in the virtual reality simulation had similar knowledge retention and attitudes towards responding during an opioid-related overdose and administering intranasal naloxone when compared to individuals participating in hybrid simulation. The lack of significant findings between training groups indicates that the mobile virtual reality training is comparable to the in-person hybrid simulation for training nursing students to appropriately administer naloxone to reverse OOD and provide immediate recovery care after revival.

K. P.; de Carvalho, R. E. F. L.","The use of simulation for nursing education has several advantages. The present study aimed to develop and validate a serious virtual reality game for medication preparation and administration training. This is a methodological study in which a serious virtual reality game named NurseVR was developed and evaluated by teachers and students of a nursing course. In NurseVR, the player presents himself or herself in a simulated hospital environment to prepare and administer a medication. From then on, all the steps to be taken are the player's free choice according to what was learned in the classroom, making the game the closest to reality. High levels of positive agreement to statements concerning the validity of the game were found between students and teachers.

A Mixed Reality system for the simulation of emergency and first-aid scenarios,"Girau, E.; Mura, F.; Bazurro, S.; Casadio, M.; Chirico, M.; Solari, F.; Chessa, M.","Simulation is a powerful learning tool, as it allows gaining direct experience in a controlled and repeatable way. However, the simulation is effective when it is able to reproduce the real conditions and when the user feels him/herself immersed and present in the situation. With the aim of improving these critical points, we propose an immersive virtual reality system for first-aid handling. Specifically, we increase the visual realism of medical mannequins and the contextualization, and we add the touch feedback by mapping the real mannequin into its virtual representation. Moreover, the interaction is performed by using a virtual representation of the users own hands by allowing a more realistic execution of tasks. The results show a good accuracy in the mapping between the real and the virtual mannequin, and a high degree of presence for both the control group and the medical one. These results and the low values of simulator sickness reported during the experiment are a good starting point for the use of the proposed mixed reality system in simulation scenarios.",2019,1-Jul,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Haptic feedback improves surgeons' user experience and fracture reduction in facial trauma simulation,"Girod, S.; Schvartzman, S. C.; Gaudilliere, D.; Salisbury, K.; Silva, R.","Computer-assisted surgical (CAS) planning tools are available for craniofacial surgery but are usually based on computer-aided design (CAD) tools that lack the ability to detect the collision of virtual objects (i.e., fractured bone seg-ments). We developed a CAS system featuring a sense of touch (haptic) that enables surgeons to physically interact with individual, patient-specific anatomy and immerse in a threedimensional virtual environment. In this study, we evaluated initial user experience with our novel system compared to an existing CAD system. Ten surgery resident trainees received a brief verbal introduction to both the haptic and CAD systems. Users simulated mandibular fracture reduction in three clinical cases within a 15 min time limit for each system and completed a questionnaire to assess their subjective experience. We compared standard landmarks and linear and angular measurements between the simulated results and the actual surgical outcome and found that haptic simulation results were not significantly different from actual postoperative outcomes. In contrast, CAD results significantly differed from both the haptic simulation and actual postoperative results. In addition to enabling a more accurate fracture repair, the haptic system provided a better user experience than the CAD system in terms of intuitiveness and self-reported quality of repair.

Developing basic robotic skills using virtual reality simulation and automated assessment tools: a multidisciplinary robotic virtual reality-based curriculum using the Da Vinci Skills Simulator and tracking progress with the Intuitive Learning platform,"Gleason, A.; Servais, E.; Quadri, S.; Manganiello, M.; Cheah, Y. L.; Simon, C. J.; Preston, E.; Graham-Stephenson, A.; Wright, V.","This study sought to develop basic robotic surgical skills among surgical trainees across multiple specialties using a VR-based curriculum and provided objective, on-demand, automated assessments using the Intuitive Learning platform. This curriculum was developed using the Da Vinci Skills Simulator and included 24 exercises. A pre-test and post-test were required for completion of the curriculum. Scores > 90 on individual exercises and the post-test were required for successful completion. The Intuitive learning platform provided automated performance metrics and tracked trainee progression. The curriculum was implemented and data collected over a 12-month period. 21 trainees completed the entire curriculum. Post-test scores were significantly higher than pre-test scores and trainees reported improvement in their robotic skills after curriculum completion. A comparison based on training level revealed that junior residents had significantly lower number of attempts per exercise, fewer penalties, and higher completion scores when compared to senior residents and fellows. Individual exercise analysis demonstrated that exercises, such as 'Three-Arm Relay' and 'Ring Rollercoaster', required the longest time and most attempts to achieve a passing score. The 'Energy Pedals' and 'Knot Tying' skills were the least-utilized skills addressed in the curriculum. Virtual reality-based curriculums using the Intuitive Learning platform can be standardized across multiple specialties allowing for the development of basic robotic skills, shared interdisciplinary surgical education, and provides powerful objective and automated performance metrics of trainees.

Augmenting prehospital care,"Glick, Y.; Avital, B.; Oppenheimer, J.; Nahman, D.; Wagnert-Avraham, L.; Eisenkraft, A.; Dym, L.; Levi, D.; Agur, A.; Gustus, B.; Furer, A.","Introduction: The challenging environment of prehospital casualty care demands providers to make prompt decisions and to engage in lifesaving interventions, occasionally without them being adequately experienced. Telementoring based on augmented reality (AR) devices has the potential to decrease the decision time and minimise the distance gap between an experienced consultant and the first responder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether telementoring with AR glasses would affect chest thoracotomy performance and self-confidence of inexperienced trainees. Methods Two groups of inexperienced medical students performed a chest thoracotomy in an ex vivo pig model. While one group was mentored remotely using HoloLens AR glasses, the second performed the procedure independently. An observer assessed the trainees' performance. In addition, trainees and mentors evaluated their own performance. Result(s): Quality of performance was found to be superior with remote guidance, without significant prolongation of the procedure (492 s vs 496 s, p=0.943). Moreover, sense of self-confidence among participant was substantially improved in the telementoring group in which 100% of the participants believed the procedure was successful compared with 40% in the control group (p=0.035). Conclusion(s): AR devices may have a role in future prehospital telementoring systems, to provide accessible consultation for first responders, and could thus positively affect the provider's confidence in decision-making, enhance procedure performance and ultimately improve patient prognosis. That being said, future studies are required to estimate full potential of this technology and additional adjustments are necessary for maximal optimisation and implementation in the field of prehospital care.

Virtual Cerebral Aneurysm Clipping with Real-Time Haptic Force Feedback in Neurosurgical Education,"Gmeiner, M.; Dirnberger, J.; Fenz, W.; Gollwitzer, M.; Wurm, G.; Trenkler, J.; Gruber, A.","Objective: Realistic, safe, and efficient modalities for simulation-based training are highly warranted to enhance the quality of surgical education, and they should be incorporated in resident training. The aim of this study was to develop a patient-specific virtual cerebral aneurysm-clipping simulator with haptic force feedback and real-time deformation of the aneurysm and vessels. Method(s): A prototype simulator was developed from 2012 to 2016. Evaluation of virtual clipping by blood flow simulation was integrated in this software, and the prototype was evaluated by 18 neurosurgeons. In 4 patients with different medial cerebral artery aneurysms, virtual clipping was performed after real-life surgery, and surgical results were compared regarding clip application, surgical trajectory, and blood flow. Result(s): After head positioning and craniotomy, bimanual virtual aneurysm clipping with an original forceps was performed. Blood flow simulation demonstrated residual aneurysm filling or branch stenosis. The simulator improved anatomic understanding for 89% of neurosurgeons. Simulation of head positioning and craniotomy was considered realistic by 89% and 94% of users, respectively. Most participants agreed that this simulator should be integrated into neurosurgical education (94%). Our illustrative cases demonstrated that virtual aneurysm surgery was possible using the same trajectory as in real-life cases. Both virtual clipping and blood flow simulation were realistic in broad-based but not calcified aneurysms. Virtual clipping of a calcified aneurysm could be performed using the same surgical trajectory, but not the same clip type. Conclusion(s): We have successfully developed a virtual aneurysm-clipping simulator. Next, we will prospectively evaluate this device for surgical procedure planning and education.

The use of a virtual patient to follow pleural pressure changes associated with therapeutic thoracentesis,"Golczewski, T.; Stecka, A. M.; Michnikowski, M.; Grabczak, E. M.; Korczynski, P.; Krenke, R.","Purpose: Influence of therapeutic thoracentesis on the pleural pressure (Pp) has been discussed in many clinical studies, however reasons of Pp changes are not precisely established. The aim of the study was to use a previously elaborated virtual cardiopulmonary patient (VP) in analysis of impact of physiological factors on Pp during the procedure. Method(s): Simulations were performed on VP with default values of parameters for which VP simulated the respiratory system of the average 50-year-old healthy Polish woman according to spirometric examination. Alterations of Pp and the amplitude of Pp changes related to breathing (AP) were analyzed. Model parameters related to chosen factors were deviated from their default values to analyze the degree of their impact on Pp and AP. The analysis was based on and supported by our own clinical data. Result(s): The Pp and AP alteration intensity appeared to be most sensitive to the compliances of the rib cage and mediastinum, and the nonlinearity of the dependence between the recoil pressure and the lung volume: the lower the compliances and the higher the nonlinearity were, the deeper the Pp fall during the procedure and the bigger the AP increase were observed. Conclusion(s): Experiments in silico are very useful in analyzing sophisticated physiological and medical problems. They made it possible to show which factors are particularly responsible for changes in Pp during thoracentesis. In the future, they may be useful in establishing objective conditions under which thoracentesis needs to be stopped.

The impact of virtual simulation on the recognition and response to the rapidly deteriorating patient among undergraduate nursing students,"Goldsworthy, S.; Muir, N.; Baron, S.; Button, D.; Goodhand, K.; Hunter, S.; McNeill, L.; Perez, G.; McParland, T.; Fasken, L.; Peachey, L.","A major patient safety challenge is recognition and response to deteriorating patients since early warning signs are often not detected in a timely manner. Nursing students typically learn the skills for early identification through clinical placement, but clinical placements are not guaranteed to provide exposure to deteriorating patients. Nursing students require practice with emergency scenarios to develop their competency and confidence to act in this area. This study aimed to explore the impact of a virtual simulation intervention on the recognition and response to the rapidly deteriorating patient among undergraduate nursing students. A mixed methods study involving a quasi-experimental pre/post design and focus groups. The participants were third or final year undergraduate nursing students from five university sites across four countries (Canada, England, Scotland and Australia, n = 88). Students were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. The treatment group received a virtual simulation intervention and participated in a focus group. The virtual simulation intervention had a significant effect on improving nursing student knowledge and clinical self-efficacy in the recognition and response to the rapidly deteriorating patient. Students reported that the virtual simulations decreased anxiety, helped them prioritize, filled gaps in their learning, and encouraged autonomous learning within a safe 'low risk' environment. Virtual simulation is an effective strategy for improving knowledge and confidence in recognizing and responding to the rapidly deteriorating patient among undergraduate nursing students.

Design Nonrandomized, prospective study. Methods Subjects who chose to participate and provided informed consent completed a structured simulation training program, which included a baseline test, 3 sessions of repeated tasks, and a final test on capsulorhexis in dominant (D) and ND hands. Participants completed demographic and satisfaction questionnaires. Performances at each session were recorded. We compared overall scores at baseline and at the end of the study, and analyzed trends over time. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP by SAS. Results Overall, 14 subjects completed the training program. In all, 3 (21.4%) were attending physicians and 11 (78.6%) were trainees. There was a significant improvement in the average overall scores (baseline vs. final) in both the D hand (33.4 vs. 46.5; p < 0.05) and the ND hand (28.9 vs. 47.7; p < 0.001). The structured training program demonstrated significantly faster performance times in both hands at the end of the study (D p< 0.001, ND p < 0.02). However, the learning curve was significantly steeper in the ND hand (p < 0.01). Participants agreed that simulation training improved the ND hand dexterity. Conclusions We found a significantly greater trend for improvement in the ND compared with the D hand.

R.; Sethi, A.; Sullivan, S. A.; Thosani, N.; Trikudanathan, G.; Trindade, A. J.; Watson, R. R.; Maple, J. T.","Background and Aims: Simulation refers to educational tools that allow for repetitive instruction in a nonpatient care environment that is risk-free. In GI endoscopy, simulators include ex vivo animal tissue models, live animal models, mechanical models, and virtual reality (VR) computer simulators. Method(s): After a structured search of the peer-reviewed medical literature, this document reviews commercially available GI endoscopy simulation systems and clinical outcomes of simulation in endoscopy. Result(s): Mechanical simulators and VR simulators are frequently used early in training, whereas ex vivo and in vivo animal models are more commonly used for advanced endoscopy training. Multiple studies and systematic reviews show that simulation-based training appears to provide novice endoscopists with some advantage over untrained peers with regard to endpoints such as independent procedure completion and performance time, among others. Data also suggest that simulation training may accelerate the acquisition of specific technical skills in colonoscopy and upper endoscopy early in training. However, the available literature suggests that the benefits of simulator training appear to attenuate and cease after a finite period. Further studies are needed to determine if meeting competency metrics using simulation will predict actual clinical competency. Conclusion(s): Simulation training is a promising modality that may aid in endoscopic education. However, for widespread incorporation of simulators into gastroenterology training programs to occur, simulators must show a sustained advantage over traditional mentored teaching in a cost-effective manner. Because most studies evaluating simulation have focused on novice learners, the role of simulation training in helping practicing endoscopists gain proficiency using new techniques and devices should be further explored.

Bronchoscopy Simulation Training as a Tool in Medical School Education,"Gopal, M.; Skobodzinski, A. A.; Sterbling, H. M.; Rao, S. R.; LaChapelle, C.; Suzuki, K.; Litle, V. R.","Background: Procedural simulation training is rare at the medical school level and little is known about its usefulness in improving anatomic understanding and procedural confidence in students. Our aim is to assess the impact of bronchoscopy simulation training on bronchial anatomy knowledge and technical skills in medical students. Method(s): Medical students were recruited by email, consented, and asked to fill out a survey regarding their baseline experience. Two thoracic surgeons measured their knowledge of bronchoscopy on a virtual reality bronchoscopy simulator using the Bronchoscopy Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool (BSTAT), a validated 65-point checklist (46 for anatomy, 19 for simulation). Students performed four self-directed training sessions of 15 minutes per week. A posttraining survey and BSTAT were completed afterward. Differences between pretraining and posttraining scores were analyzed with paired Student's t tests and random intercept linear regression models accounting for baseline BSTAT score, total training time, and training year. Result(s): The study was completed by 47 medical students with a mean training time of 81.5 +/- 26.8 minutes. Mean total BSTAT score increased significantly from 12.3 +/- 5.9 to 48.0 +/- 12.9 (p < 0.0001); mean scores for bronchial anatomy increased from 0.1 +/- 0.9 to 31.1 +/- 12.3 (p < 0.0001); and bronchoscopy navigational skills increased from 12.1 +/- 5.7 to 17.4 +/- 2.5 (p < 0.0001). Total training time and frequency of training did not have a significant impact on level of improvement.

Creating a Novel Disaster Medicine Virtual Reality Training Environment,"Gout, L.; Hart, A.; Houze-Cerfon, C. H.; Sarin, R.; Ciottone, G. R.; Bounes, V.","INTRODUCTION: Disasters are high-acuity, low-frequency events which require medical providers to respond in often chaotic settings. Due to this infrequency, skills can atrophy, so providers must train and drill to maintain them. Historically, drilling for disaster response has been costly, and thus infrequent. Virtual Reality Environments (VREs) have been demonstrated to be acceptable to trainees, and useful for training Disaster Medicine skills. The improved cost of virtual reality training can allow for increased frequency of simulation and training. PROBLEM: The problem addressed was to create a novel Disaster Medicine VRE for training and drilling. METHOD(S): A VRE was created using SecondLife (Linden Lab; San Francisco, California USA) and adapted for use in Disaster Medicine training and drilling. It is easily accessible for the end-users (trainees), and is adaptable for multiple scenario types due to the presence of varying architecture and objects. Victim models were created which can be role played by educators, or can be virtual dummies, and can be adapted for wide ranging scenarios. Finally, a unique physiologic simulator was created which allows for dummies to mimic disease processes, wounds, and treatment outcomes. RESULT(S): The VRE was created and has been used extensively in an academic setting to train medical students, as well as to train and drill disaster responders.

Surgical Training 2.0: A systematic approach reviewing the literature focusing on oral maxillofacial surgery - Part II,"Grall, P.; Ferri, J.; Nicot, R.","PURPOSE: Many technologies are emerging in the medical field. Having an overview of the technological arsenal available to train new surgeons seems very interesting to guide subsequent surgical training protocols. METHOD(S): This article is a systematic approach reviewing new technologies in surgical training, in particular in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This review explores what new technologies can do compared to traditional methods in the field of surgical education. A structured literature search of PubMed was performed in adherence to PRISMA guidelines. The articles were selected when they fell within predefined inclusion criteria while respecting the key objectives of this systematic review. We looked at medical students and more specifically in surgery and analysed whether exposure to new technologies improved their surgical skills compared to traditional methods. Each technology is reviewed by highlighting its advantages and disadvantages and studying the feasibility of integration into current practice. RESULT(S): The results are encouraging. Indeed, all of these technologies make it possible to reduce the learning time, the operating times, the operating complications and increase the enthusiasm of the students compared to more conventional methods. The start-up cost, the complexity to develop new models, and the openness of mind necessary for the integration of these technologies are all obstacles to immediate development. The main limitations of this review are that many of the studies have been carried out on small numbers, they are not interested in acquiring knowledge or skills over the long term and obviously there is a publication bias. CONCLUSION(S): Surgical education methods will probably change in the years to come, integrating these new technologies into the curriculum seems essential so as not to remain on the side.

Audiohaptic feedback enhances motor performance in a low-fidelity simulated drilling task,"Grant, B. L.; Yielder, P. C.; Patrick, T. A.; Kapralos, B.; Williams-bell, M.; Murphy, B. A.","When used in educational settings, simulations utilizing virtual reality (VR) technologies can reduce training costs while providing a safe and effective learning environment. Tasks can be easily modified to maximize learning objectives of different levels of trainees (e.g., novice, intermediate, expert), and can be repeated for the development of psychomotor skills. VR offers a multisensory experience, providing visual, auditory, and haptic sensations with varying levels of fidelity. While simulating visual and auditory stimuli is relatively easy and cost-effective, similar representations of haptic sensation still require further development. Evidence suggests that mixing high- and low-fidelity realistic sensations (e.g., audition and haptic) can improve the overall perception of realism, however, whether this also leads to improved performance has not been examined. The current study examined whether audiohaptic stimuli presented in a virtual drilling task can lead to improved motor performance and subjective realism, compared to auditory stimuli alone. Right-handed participants (n = 16) completed 100 drilling trials of each stimulus type. Performance measures indicated that participants overshot the target during auditory trials, and undershot the target during audiohaptic trials. Undershooting is thought to be indicative of improved performance, optimizing both time and energy requirements. Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

The impact of three-dimensional visualisation on midwifery students' application of knowledge of the third stage of labour to practice: Qualitative findings of a pilot randomised controlled trial,"Gray, M.; Downer, T.; Hanson, J.; Hartz, D.; Gao, Y.; Andersen, P.","Problem: Complex physiological processes are often difficult for midwifery students to comprehend when using traditional teaching and learning approaches. Online resources for midwifery education are limited. Background(s): Face to face instructional workshops using simulation have had some impact on improving understanding. However, in the 21st century new technologies offer the opportunity to provide alternative learning approaches. Virtual and artificial realities have been shown to increase confidence in decision making during clinical practice. Aim(s): Explore the impact of using three-dimensional (3D) visualisation in midwifery education, on student's application, when educating women about the birth of the placenta, and membranes. Method(s): Face to face individual interviews were performed, to collect deep, meaningful experiences of students, learning about the third stage of labour. Finding(s): Prior clinical experiences impacted on student's ability to articulate how they would discuss birth of the placenta and membranes, and the process of haemostasis with women. Discussion(s): The narrative findings of this pilot study identified ways that students traditionally learn midwifery, through theory, and clinical practice. Interview narratives illustrated how midwifery students who had previous experiences of witnessing birth, had superior ability to discuss the third stage of labour with women. While students with limited birth experiences, found the 3DMVR assisted them in their understanding of the physiology of the third stage of labour. Conclusion(s): In an environment of increasing technological advances, clinical placements remain an essential component of midwifery education.

"The impact of three-dimensional visualisation on midwifery student learning, compared with traditional education for teaching the third stage of labour: A pilot randomised controlled trial","Gray, M.; Downer, T.; Hartz, D.; Andersen, P.; Hanson, J.; Gao, Y.","BACKGROUND: Complex physiological processes are often difficult for midwifery students to comprehend when using traditional teaching and learning approaches. Face to face instructional workshops using simulation have had some impact on improving understanding. However, in the 21st century new technologies offer the opportunity to provide alternative learning approaches. AIM: To investigate the impact of using three-dimensional (3D) visualisation in midwifery education on student's experience of learning, and retention of knowledge at three points in time. DESIGN: A pilot study involving a two-armed parallel Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) comparing the retention of knowledge scores between the control and intervention groups. SETTING: An Australian University in the Northern Territory. PARTICIPANTS: The sample included second year Bachelor of Midwifery students (n = 38). All received traditional midwifery education before being randomly allocated to either the intervention (n = 20) or control (n = 18) group. METHOD(S): A new immersive virtual environment was introduced to complement existing traditional midwifery education on the third stage of labour. This intervention was evaluated using a demographic survey and multiple-choice questionnaire to collect baseline information via Qualtrics. To measure change in knowledge and comprehension, participants completed the same multiple-choice knowledge questionnaire at three time points; pre, immediately post and at 1 month post intervention. In addition, the intervention group completed a 3D student satisfaction survey. RESULT(S): Baseline knowledge scores were similar between the groups. A statistically significant increase in knowledge score was evident immediately post intervention for the intervention group, however there was no significant difference in knowledge score at one month. CONCLUSION(S): The results support the creation of further three-dimensional visualisation teaching resources for midwifery education. However, a larger randomised controlled study is needed to seek generalisation of these findings to confirm enhanced student learning and retention of knowledge post 3DMVR, beyond the immediate exposure time.

Randomized study comparing 3D virtual reality and conventional 2D on-screen teaching of cerebrovascular anatomy,"Greuter, L.; De Rosa, A.; Cattin, P.; Croci, D. M.; Soleman, J.; Guzman, R.","OBJECTIVE: Performing aneurysmal clipping requires years of training to successfully understand the 3D neurovascular anatomy. This training has traditionally been obtained by learning through observation. Currently, with fewer operative aneurysm clippings, stricter work-hour regulations, and increased patient safety concerns, novel teaching methods are required for young neurosurgeons. Virtual-reality (VR) models offer the opportunity to either train a specific surgical skill or prepare for an individual surgery. With this study, the authors aimed to compare the spatial orientation between traditional 2D images and 3D VR models in neurosurgical residents or medical students. METHOD(S): Residents and students were each randomly assigned to describe 4 aneurysm cases, which could be either 2D images or 3D VR models. The time to aneurysm detection as well as a spatial anatomical description was assessed via an online questionnaire and compared between the groups. The aneurysm cases were 10 selected patient cases treated at the authors' institution. RESULT(S): Overall, the time to aneurysm detection was shorter in the 3D VR model compared to 2D images, with a trend toward statistical significance (25.77 +/- 37.26 vs 45.70 +/- 51.94 seconds, p = 0.052). No significant difference was observed for residents (3D VR 24.47 +/- 40.16 vs 2D 33.52 +/- 56.06 seconds, p = 0.564), while in students a significantly shorter time to aneurysm detection was measured using 3D VR models (26.95 +/- 35.39 vs 59.16 +/- 44.60 seconds, p = 0.015). No significant differences between the modalities for anatomical and descriptive spatial mistakes were observed. Most participants (90%) preferred the 3D VR models for aneurysm detection and description, and only 1 participant (5%) described VR-related side effects such as dizziness or nausea. CONCLUSION(S): VR platforms facilitate aneurysm recognition and understanding of its spatial anatomy, which could make them the preferred method compared to 2D images in the years to come.",2021,1-Aug,Neurosurgical focus,51(2),,E18,635781399,,,#1855,Greuter 2021,"Jeffrey Jacobson (2022-10-14 10:35:50)(Screen): Seems like a very insightful piece on 3D vs 2D SBS.  recommend ""yes""; ",
Development and initial evaluation of a novel simulation model for comprehensive brain tumor surgery training,"Grosch, A. S.; Schroder, T.; Onken, J.; Picht, T.","Background: Increasing technico-manual complexity of procedures and time constraints necessitates effective neurosurgical training. For this purpose, both screen- and model-based simulations are under investigation. Approaches including 3D printed brains, gelatin composite models, and virtual environments have already been published. However, quality of brain surgery simulation is limited due to discrepancies in visual and haptic experience. Similarly, virtual training scenarios are still lacking sufficient real-world resemblance. In this study, we introduce a novel simulator for realistic neurosurgical training that combines real brain tissue with 3D printing and augmented reality. Method(s): Based on a human CT scan, a skull base and skullcap were 3D printed and equipped with an artificial dura mater. The cerebral hemispheres of a calf's brain were placed in the convexity of the skullcap and tumor masses composed of aspic, water, and fluorescein were injected in the brain. The skullcap and skull base were placed on each other, glued together, and filled up with an aspic water solution for brain fixation. Then, four surgical scenarios were performed in the operating room as follows: (1) simple tumor resection, (2) complex tumor resection, (3) navigated biopsy via burr hole trepanation, and (4) retrosigmoidal craniotomy. Neuronavigation, augmented reality, fluorescence, and ocular-as well as screen-based (exoscopic)-surgery were available for the simulator training. A total of 29 participants performed at least one training scenario of the simulator and completed a 5-item Likert-like questionnaire as well as qualitative interviews. The questionnaire assessed the realism of the tumor model, skull, and brain tissue as well as the capability for training purposes. Result(s): Visual and sensory realism of the skull and brain tissue were rated,""very good,"" while the sensory and visual realism of the tumor model were rated ""good."" Both overall satisfaction with the model and eligibility of the microscope and neurosurgical instruments for training purposes were rated with ""very good."" However, small size of the calf's brain, its limited shelf life, and the inability to simulate bleedings due to the lack of perfusion were significant drawbacks. Conclusion(s): The combination of 3D printing and real brain tissue provided surgical scenarios with very good real-life resemblance. This novel neurosurgical model features a versatile setup for surgical skill training and allows for efficient training of technological support like image and fluorescence guidance, exoscopic surgery, and robotic technology.

Virtual reality simulator versus box-trainer to teach minimally invasive procedures: A meta-analysis,"Guedes, H. G.; Camara Costa Ferreira, Z. M.; Ribeiro de Sousa Leao, L.; Souza Montero, E. F.; Otoch, J. P.; Luiz de Almeida Artifon, E.","Background: To evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality simulator (VRS) training compared to box-trainer training (BT) for learning outcomes in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques. Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic review of the literature was performed using CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS. The primary outcomes were time to perform MIS and performance score in MIS. After being selected, the articles were evaluated for methodological quality and risk of bias. The results were evaluated for quality of evidence and meta-analysis was performed. Result(s): 20 randomized clinical trials were included in the qualitative analysis and 14 were used in the meta-analysis. VRS training was more efficient than BT training (P < 0.00001, 95% CI: 35.08 to -25.01) when evaluating participant time needed to complete the peg task. In descriptive analysis, VRS training was better than BT training in participant performance score to perform MIS. There was no statistical difference in the meta-analysis in the time needed to perform surgery, time to complete basic or advanced tasks and performance score for basic or advanced tasks. Conclusion(s): VRS training was better than BT training in participant performance scores when performing MIS and in the time needed to complete the basic task of peg transfer. In all other outcomes, regardless of the student's level of experience or type of activity, the two forms of training were equivalent.

Medical Students' Experiences and Outcomes Using a Virtual Human Simulation to Improve Communication Skills: Mixed Methods Study,"Guetterman, T. C.; Sakakibara, R.; Baireddy, S.; Kron, F. W.; Scerbo, M. W.; Cleary, J. F.; Fetters, M. D.","BACKGROUND: Attending to the wide range of communication behaviors that convey empathy is an important but often underemphasized concept to reduce errors in care, improve patient satisfaction, and improve cancer patient outcomes. A virtual human (VH)-based simulation, MPathic-VR, was developed to train health care providers in empathic communication with patients and in interprofessional settings and evaluated through a randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE(S): This mixed methods study aimed to investigate the differential effects of a VH-based simulation developed to train health care providers in empathic patient-provider and interprofessional communication. METHOD(S): We employed a mixed methods intervention design, involving a comparison of 2 quantitative measures-MPathic-VR-calculated scores and the objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) scores-with qualitative reflections by medical students about their experiences. This paper is a secondary, focused analysis of intervention arm data from the larger trial. Students at 3 medical schools in the United States (n=206) received simulation to improve empathic communication skills. We conducted analysis of variance, thematic text analysis, and merging mixed methods analysis. RESULT(S): OSCE scores were significantly improved for learners in the intervention group (mean 0.806, SD 0.201) compared with the control group (mean 0.752, SD 0.198; F1,414=6.09; P=.01). Qualitative analysis revealed 3 major positive themes for the MPathic-VR group learners: gaining useful communication skills, learning awareness of nonverbal skills in addition to verbal skills, and feeling motivated to learn more about communication. Finally, the results of the mixed methods analysis indicated that most of the variation between high, middle, and lower performers was noted about nonverbal behaviors. Medium and high OSCE scorers most often commented on the importance of nonverbal communication. Themes of motivation to learn about communication were only present in middle and high scorers. CONCLUSION(S): VHs are a promising strategy for improving empathic communication in health care. Higher performers seemed most engaged to learn, particularly nonverbal skills.

Comparison of the Effectiveness of a Virtual Simulator With a Plastic Arm Model in Teaching Intravenous Catheter Insertion Skills,"Gunay Ismailoglu, E.; Zaybak, A.","The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a virtual intravenous simulator with a plastic arm model in teaching intravenous catheter insertion skills to nursing students. We used a randomized controlled quasi-experimental trial design and recruited 65 students who were assigned to the experimental (n = 33) and control (n = 32) groups using the simple random sampling method. The experimental group received intravenous catheterization skills training on the virtual intravenous simulator, and the control group received the same training on a plastic model of a human arm. Data were collected using the personal information form, intravenous catheterization knowledge assessment form, Intravenous Catheterization Skill Test, Self-Confidence and Satisfaction Scale, and Fear Symptoms Scale. In the study, the mean scores in the control group were 20.44 for psychomotor skills, 15.62 for clinical psychomotor skills, 31.78 for self-confidence, and 21.77 for satisfaction. The mean scores in the experimental group were 45.18 for psychomotor skills, 16.28 for clinical psychomotor skills, 34.18 for self-confidence, and 43.89 for satisfaction. The results indicated that psychomotor skills and satisfaction scores were higher in the experimental group, while the clinical psychomotor skills and self-confidence scores were similar in both groups.

Accelerated Skills Acquisition Protocol (ASAP) in optimizing robotic surgical simulation training: a prospective randomized study,"Gurung, P. M. S.; Campbell, T.; Wang, B.; Joseph, J. V.; Ghazi, A. E.","PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of an accelerated proficiency-based training protocol in robotic simulation practice in delivering durable proficiency compared to conventional training methods. METHOD(S): Novice medical students (n=16) were randomized into either the accelerated skills acquisition protocol (ASAP) or conventional training protocol (CTP). Subjects were trained to proficiency on the da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS) by an expert trainer. Differences in the repetitions required to achieve proficiency in two simple and two complex virtual reality (VR) training tasks were assessed as the primary outcome measure. Transfer of the acquired skills to two other non-practiced tasks was assessed immediately and prospectively followed through to 3, 6 and 12 months in the two groups. Retention of the practiced tasks was assessed along the same timeframe. RESULT(S): Subjects in the ASAP group acquired proficiency significantly faster in three of the four training tasks: camera control (p=0.0002), suture sponge (p<0.0001), ring walk3 (p<0.0001), and peg board (p=0.6936). When assessing transfer of skills, there were no significant differences between the two groups: Ring rail 3 (p=0.6807) and Tubes (p=0.2240). When assessing retention of skills at 3, 6 and 12 months, for all 6 tasks, no significant differences were seen between the ASAP and CTP groups. CONCLUSION(S): ASAP is proven to be an efficient approach for delivering proficiency in robotic VR simulation training. The results are durable when compared to conventional simulation training methods. The findings may have significant implications in the design of robotic VR simulation curricula.",2020,1-Jul,World journal of urology,38(7),,1623-1630,628549162,,,#1921,Gurung 2020,,
Hip-fracture osteosynthesis training: exploring learning curves and setting proficiency standards,"Gustafsson, A.; Pedersen, P.; Romer, T. B.; Viberg, B.; Palm, H.; Konge, L.","Background and purpose - Orthopedic surgeons must be able to perform internal fixation of proximal femoral fractures early in their career, but inexperienced trainees prolong surgery and cause increased reoperation rates. Simulation-based virtual reality (VR) training has been proposed to overcome the initial steep part of the learning curve but it is unknown how much simulation training is necessary before trainees can progress to supervised surgery on patients. We determined characteristics of learning curves for novices and experts and a pass/fail mastery-learning standard for junior trainees was established. Methods - 38 first-year residents and 8 consultants specialized in orthopedic trauma surgery performed cannulated screws, Hansson pins, and sliding hip screw on the Swemac TraumaVision VR simulator. A previously validated test was used. The participants repeated the procedures until they reached their learning plateau. Results - The novices and the experts reached their learning plateau after an average of 169 minutes (95% CI 152-87) and 143 minutes (CI 109-177), respectively. Highest achieved scores were 92% (CI 91-93) for novices and 96% (CI 94-97) for experts. Plateau score, defined as the average of the 4 last scores, was 85% (CI 82-87) and 92% (CI 89-96) for the novices and the experts, respectively. Interpretation - Training time to reach plateau varied widely and it is paramount that simulation-based training continues to a predefined standard instead of ending after a fixed number of attempts or amount of time. A score of 92% comparable to the experts' plateau score could be used as a mastery learning pass/fail standard. Copyright © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The description and evaluation of virtual worlds in clinical pharmacy education in Northern Sweden,"Gustafsson, M.; Englund, C.; Gallego, G.","Background and purpose The purpose of this article is to describe and evaluate the use of a three-dimensional virtual world (3DVW) in a clinical pharmacy course. Educational activity and setting Students are provided with training opportunities in simulated ward rounds and patient meetings in a 3DVW. The 3DVW enables students to practice communication with patients and colleagues in a professional manner. To evaluate the course and use of the 3DVW, an online course evaluation was completed by students after they had finished the clinical pharmacy course. Findings Forty-two students completed the online course evaluation (62%). Most students (83%) reported that they could adopt the role of a clinical pharmacist in the 3DVW. Sixty percent reported that the environment felt authentic, although some noted that ""it can never be quite the same as sitting next to a real person to talk"". More than half of the students (66%) described the use of the 3DVW as a worthwhile exercise. The majority (93%) rated the overall quality of the course as good or very good, with 76% reporting that the pedagogical design of the course helped them with their studies. Discussion and summary Students at Umea University valued the use of 3DVWs in clinical pharmacy teaching. However, there is a need to make the virtual environment more realistic and easier to use. The invaluable feedback gathered from students will help to improve the future use of virtual worlds in pharmacy education.

Performance and perception of haptic feedback in a laparoscopic 3D virtual reality simulator,"Hagelsteen, K.; Johansson, R.; Ekelund, M.; Bergenfelz, A.; Anderberg, M.","Background: The benefit of haptic feedback in laparoscopic virtual reality simulators (VRS) is ambiguous. A previous study found 32% faster acquisition of skills with the combination of 3 D and haptic feedback compared to 2 D only. This study aimed to validate perception and effect on performance of haptic feedback by experienced surgeons in the previously tested VRS. Material(s) and Method(s): A randomized single blinded cross-over study with laparoscopists (>100 laparoscopic procedures) was conducted in a VRS with 3 D imaging. One group started with haptic feedback, and the other group without. After performing the suturing task with haptics either enabled or disabled, the groups crossed over to the opposite setting. Face validity was assessed through questionnaires. Metrics were obtained from the VRS. Result(s): The haptics for 'handling the needle', 'needle through tissue' and 'tying the knot' was scored as completely realistic by 3/22, 1/22 and 2/22 respectively. Comparing the metrics for maximum stretch damage between the groups revealed a significantly lower score when a group performed with haptics enabled p =.027 (haptic first group) and p <.001(haptic last group). Conclusion(s): Haptic feedback in VRS has limited fidelity according to the tested laparoscopic surgeons. In spite of this, significantly less stretch damage was caused with haptics enabled.

Teaching the management of trauma patients through virtual reality,"Hainsworth, L.; Kosti, A.; Lloyd, A.; Kiddle, A.; Bamford, R.; Hunter, I.","INTRODUCTION: Virtual reality (VR) fully immersive interactive video teaching (VR FIIT) allows learners to develop through observing and interacting with complex realistic environments, developing technical and nontechnical skills. One such complex clinical environment is managing a trauma patient. Despite the significant developments in managing these patients, foundation doctors are frequently highly anxious due to their limited knowledge and experience. The aim of this project was twofold; to improve foundation doctor performance of managing trauma patients and to reduce their associated anxiety, through the use of VR teaching. METHOD(S): A total of 14 foundation doctors were divided into two groups. One group underwent departmental teaching. The second group underwent departmental teaching and VR FIIT. We assessed the doctors via two methods. First, time taken to complete tasks correctly in trauma simulations was compared. Second, the doctors completed a self-reported level-based assessment questionnaire regarding anxiety and stress around trauma calls. RESULT(S): The VR FIIT intervention group were able to complete each task on average 118s faster than the standard group. The standard group missed essential tasks such as C-spine immobilisation. The VR FIIT group self-reported significantly lower levels of anxiety related to trauma calls.

Technology-enhanced learning in orthopaedics: Virtual reality and multi-modality educational workshops may be effective in the training of surgeons and operating department staff,"Hall, A. J.; Walmsley, P.","AIM: The aims were to assess the utility of: 1) virtual reality-mediated simulation, and 2) a multi-modality 'Bootcamp' in the delivery of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) teaching to orthopaedic surgical trainees. BACKGROUND: Surgical training opportunities are diminished as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which may result in delays to training completion and gaps in the permanent workforce. Modern and technology-enhanced learning methods have been identified as having the potential to support high-quality and sustainable education. METHOD(S): This mixed-methods study assessed the educational benefit of two activities designed to teach TKA to junior (ST1-3) orthopaedic trainees. A multi-modality training Bootcamp was delivered that included: virtual reality (VR) and saw-bone simulation; tutorials, and case-based symposia. The VR component was delivered to different participants (surgical trainees, scrub nurses, and consultants) on a further two separate occasions. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected pertaining to utility and performance. RESULT(S): Trainees reported that the Bootcamp improved comprehension of arthroplasty principles including component alignment, knee balancing, and intraoperative strategies. Case-based discussions helped develop diagnostic and decision-making skills. The VR activity improved understanding of the surgical process map, increased ability to anticipate steps, and consider the procedure strategically. All staff groups found the VR activity beneficial and would recommend it as a useful addition to a surgical department. CONCLUSION(S): VR-mediated simulation could augment the education of surgical trainees and scrub team staff by improving comprehension of the surgical process map. Integrated multi-modality 'Bootcamp-style' training activities constructed around trainees' needs may provide a sustainable solution to bridge the experience gap related to reduced exposure to elective orthopaedic practice.

The utility of virtual reality surgical simulation in the undergraduate otorhinolaryngology curriculum,"Hardcastle, T.; Wood, A.","Objective To examine the impact of temporal bone virtual reality surgical simulator use in the undergraduate otorhinolaryngology curriculum.Methods Medical students attended a workshop involving the use of a temporal bone virtual reality surgical simulator. Students completed a pre-workshop questionnaire on career interests. A post-workshop questionnaire evaluated the perceived usefulness and enjoyment of the virtual reality surgical simulator experience, and assessed changes in their interest in ENT.Results Thirty-two fifth-year University of Auckland medical students were recruited. The majority of students (53.1 per cent) had already chosen their career path. The simulator experience was useful for: stimulating thoughts around career plans (71.9 per cent), providing hands-on experience (93.8 per cent) and teaching disease processes (93.8 per cent). After the workshop, 53.1 per cent of students were more interested in a career in ENT.Conclusion Virtual reality may be a fun and engaging way of teaching ENT. Furthermore, it could help guide student career planning. Copyright © JLO (1984) Limited, 2018.",2018,1-Dec,Journal of Laryngology and Otology,132(12),,1072-1076,625100450,,,#2001,Hardcastle 2018,,
Validation of the portable virtual reality training system for robotic surgery (PoLaRS): a randomized controlled trial,"Hardon, S. F.; Kooijmans, A.; Horeman, R.; van der Elst, M.; Bloemendaal, A. L. A.; Horeman, T.","Background: As global use of surgical robotic systems is steadily increasing, surgical simulation can be an excellent way for robotic surgeons to acquire and retain their skills in a safe environment. To address the need for training in less wealthy parts of the world, an affordable surgical robot simulator (PoLaRS) was designed. Method(s): The aim of this pilot study is to compare learning curve data of the PoLaRS prototype with those of Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS) and to establish face- and construct validity. Medical students were divided into two groups; the test group (n = 18) performing tasks on PoLaRS and dVSS, and the control group (n = 20) only performing tasks on the dVSS. The performance parameters were Time, Path length, and the number of collisions. Afterwards, the test group participants filled in a questionnaire regarding both systems. Result(s): A total of 528 trials executed by 38 participants were measured and included for analyses. The test group significantly improved in Time, Path Length and Collisions during the PoLaRS test phase (P <= 0.028). No differences was found between the test group and the control group in the dVSS performances during the post-test phase. Learning curves showed similar shapes between both systems, and between both groups. Participants recognized the potential benefits of simulation training on the PoLaRS system. Conclusion(s): Robotic surgical skills improved during training with PoLaRS. This shows the potential of PoLaRS to become an affordable alternative to current surgical robot simulators. Validation with similar tasks and different expert levels is needed before implementing the training system into robotic training curricula.

The correlation between fundamental characteristics and first-time performance in laparoscopic tasks,"Harrington, C. M.; Bresler, R.; Ryan, D.; Dicker, P.; Traynor, O.; Kavanagh, D. O.","Background: The ability of characteristics to predict first time performance in laparoscopic tasks is not well described. Videogame experience predicts positive performance in laparoscopic experiences but its mechanism and confounding-association with aptitude remains to be elucidated. This study sought to evaluate for innate predictors of laparoscopic performance in surgically naive individuals with minimal videogame exposure. Method(s): Participants with no prior laparoscopic exposure and minimal videogaming experience were recruited consecutively from preclinical years at a medical university. Participants completed four visuospatial, one psychomotor aptitude test and an electronic survey, followed by four laparoscopic tasks on a validated Virtual Reality simulator (LAP MentorTM). Result(s): Twenty eligible individuals participated with a mean age of 20.8 (+/-3.8) years. Significant intra-aptitude performance correlations were present amongst 75% of the visuospatial tests. These visuospatial aptitudes correlated significantly with multiple laparoscopic task metrics: number of movements of a dominant instrument (r<inf>s</inf> >= -0.46), accuracy rate of clip placement (r<inf>s</inf> >= 0.50) and time taken (r<inf>s</inf> >= -0.47) (p < 0.05). Musical Instrument experience predicted higher average speed of instruments (r<inf>s</inf> >= 0.47) (p < 0.05). Participant's revised competitive index level predicted lower proficiency in laparoscopic metrics including: pathlength, economy and number of movements of dominant instrument (r<inf>s</inf> >= 0.46) (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Multiple visuospatial aptitudes and innate competitive level influenced baseline laparoscopic performances across several tasks in surgically naive individuals.

Playing to your skills: a randomised controlled trial evaluating a dedicated video game for minimally invasive surgery,"Harrington, C. M.; Chaitanya, V.; Dicker, P.; Traynor, O.; Kavanagh, D. O.","Background: Video gaming demands elements of visual attention, hand-eye coordination and depth perception which may be contiguous with laparoscopic skill development. General video gaming has demonstrated altered cortical plasticity and improved baseline/acquisition of minimally invasive skills. The present study aimed to evaluate for skill acquisition associated with a commercially available dedicated laparoscopic video game (Underground) and its unique (laparoscopic-like) controller for the NintendoWii UTM console. Method(s): This single-blinded randomised controlled study was conducted with laparoscopically naive student volunteers of limited (< 3 h/week) video gaming backgrounds. Baseline laparoscopic skills were assessed using four basic tasks on the Virtual Reality (VR) simulator (LAP Mentor<sup>TM</sup>, 3D systems, Colorado, USA). Twenty participants were randomised to two groups; Group A was requested to complete 5 h of video gaming (Underground) per week and Group B to avoid gaming beyond their normal frequency. After 4 weeks participants were reassessed using the same VR tasks. Changes in simulator performances were assessed for each group and for intergroup variances using mixed model regression. Result(s): Significant inter- and intragroup performances were present for the video gaming and controls across four basic tasks. The video gaming group demonstrated significant improvements in thirty-one of the metrics examined including dominant (p <= 0.004) and non-dominant (p < 0.050) instrument movements, pathlengths (p <= 0.040), time taken (p <= 0.021) and end score [p <= 0.046, (task-dependent)]. The control group demonstrated improvements in fourteen measures. The video gaming group demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) improvements compared to the control in five metrics. Despite encouraged gameplay and the console in participants' domiciles, voluntary engagement was lower than directed due to factors including: game enjoyment (33.3%), lack of available time (22.2%) and entertainment distractions (11.1%). Conclusion(s): Our work revealed significant value in training using a dedicated laparoscopic video game for acquisition of virtual laparoscopic skills. This novel serious game may provide foundations for future surgical developments on game consoles in the home environment.

Development and evaluation of a trauma decision-making simulator in Oculus virtual reality,"Harrington, C. M.; Kavanagh, D. O.; Quinlan, J. F.; Ryan, D.; Dicker, P.; O'Keeffe, D.; Traynor, O.; Tierney, S.","Background Consumer-available virtual-reality technology was launched in 2016 with strong foundations in the entertainment-industry. We developed an innovative medical-training simulator on the OculusTM Gear-VR platform. This novel application was developed utilising internationally recognised Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles, requiring decision-making skills for critically-injured virtual-patients. Methods Participants were recruited in June, 2016 at a single-centre trauma-course (ATLS, Leinster, Ireland) and trialled the platform. Simulator performances were correlated with individual expertise and course-performance measures. A post-intervention questionnaire relating to validity-aspects was completed. Results Eighteen(81.8%) eligible-candidates and eleven(84.6%) course-instructors voluntarily participated. The survey-responders mean-age was 38.9(+/-11.0) years with 80.8% male predominance. The instructor-group caused significantly less fatal-errors (p < 0.050) and proportions of incorrect-decisions (p < 0.050). The VR-hardware and trauma-application's mean ratings were 5.09 and 5.04 out of 7 respectively. Participants reported it was an enjoyable method of learning (median-6.0), the learning platform of choice (median-5.0) and a cost-effective training tool (median-5.0). Conclusion Our research has demonstrated evidence of validity-criteria for a concept application on virtual-reality headsets. We believe that virtual-reality technology is a viable platform for medical-simulation into the future.

360degree Operative Videos: A Randomised Cross-Over Study Evaluating Attentiveness and Information Retention,"Harrington, C. M.; Kavanagh, D. O.; Wright Ballester, G.; Wright Ballester, A.; Dicker, P.; Traynor, O.; Hill, A.; Tierney, S.","Objective: Although two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional videos have traditionally provided foundations for reviewing operative procedures, the recent 360 format may provide new dimensions to surgical education. This study sought to describe the production of a high quality 360 video for an index-operation (augmented with educational material), while evaluating for variances in attentiveness, information retention, and appraisal compared to 2D. Design(s): A 6-camera synchronised array (GoPro Omni, [California, United States]) was suspended inverted and recorded an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2016. A single-blinded randomised cross-over study was performed to evaluate this video in 360 vs 2D formats. Group A experienced the 360 video using Samsung (Suwon, South-Korea) GearVR virtual-reality headsets, followed by the 2D experience on a 75-inch television. Group B were reversed. Each video was probed at designated time points for engagement levels and task-unrelated images or thoughts. Alternating question banks were administered following each video experience. Feedback was obtained via a short survey at study completion. Setting(s): The New Academic and Education Building (NAEB) in Dublin, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, July 2017. Participant(s): Preclinical undergraduate students from a medical university in Ireland. Result(s): Forty students participated with a mean age of 23.2 +/- 4.5 years and equal sex involvement. The 360 video demonstrated significantly higher engagement (p < 0.01) throughout the experience and lower task-unrelated images or thoughts (p < 0.01). Significant variances in information retention between the 2 groups were absent (p = 0.143) but most (65%) reported the 360 video as their learning platform of choice. Mean appraisal levels for the 360 platform were positive with mean responses of >8/10 for the platform for learning, immersion, and entertainment. Conclusion(s): This study describes the successful development and evaluation of a 360 operative video. This new video format demonstrated significant engagement and attentiveness benefits compared to traditional 2D formats. This requires further evaluation in the field of technology enhanced learning.

The Validation of a Novel Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Virtual Reality Module,"Harrison, P.; Raison, N.; Abe, T.; Watkinson, W.; Dar, F.; Challacombe, B.; Van Der Poel, H.; Khan, M. S.; Dasgupa, P.; Ahmed, K.","Objective: To perform the first validation of a full procedural virtual reality robotic training module and analysis of novice surgeon's learning curves. Design(s): Participants completed the bladder neck dissection task and urethrovesical anastomosis task (UVA) as part of the prostatectomy module. Surgeons completed feedback questionnaires assessing the realism, content, acceptability and feasibility of the module. Novice surgeons completed a 5.5-hour training programme using both tasks. Setting(s): King's College London, London. Participant(s): 13 novice, 24 intermediate and 8 expert surgeons completed the validation study. Result(s): Realism was scored highly for BDN (mean 3.4/5) and UVA (3.74/5), as was importance of BDN (4.32/5) and UVA (4.6/5) for training. It was rated as a feasible (3.95/5) and acceptable (4/5) tool for training. Experts performed significantly better than novice group in 6 metrics in the UVA including time (p = 0.0005), distance by camera (p = 0.0010) and instrument collisions (p = 0.0033), as well as task-specific metrics such as number of unnecessary needle piercing points (p = 0.0463). In novice surgeons, a significant improvement in performance after training was seen in many metrics for both tasks. For bladder neck dissection task, this included time (p < 0.0001), instrument collisions (p = 0.0013) and total time instruments are out of view (p = 0.0251). For UVA, this included time (p = 0.0135), instrument collisions (p = 0.0066) and task-specific metrics such as injury to the urethra (p = 0.0032) and bladder (p = 0.0189). Conclusion(s): Surgeons found this full procedural VR training module to be a realistic, feasible and acceptable component for a robotic surgical training programme. Construct validity was proven between expert and novice surgeons. Novice surgeons have shown a significant learning curve over 5.5 hours of training, suggesting this module could be used in a surgical curriculum for acquisition of technical skills. Further implementation of this module into the curriculum and continued analysis would be beneficial to gauge how it can be fully utilised.

A proficiency-based virtual reality endoscopy curriculum improves performance on the fundamentals of endoscopic surgery examination,"Hashimoto, D. A.; Petrusa, E.; Phitayakorn, R.; Valle, C.; Casey, B.; Gee, D.","Introduction: The fundamentals of endoscopic surgery (FES) examination is a national test of knowledge and skill in flexible gastrointestinal endoscopy. The skill portion of the examination involves five tasks that assesses the following skills: scope navigation, loop reduction, mucosal inspection, retroflexion, and targeting. This project aimed to assess the efficacy of a proficiency-based virtual reality (VR) curriculum in preparing residents for the FES skills exam. Method(s): Experienced (>100 career colonoscopies) and inexperienced endoscopists (<50 career colonoscopies) were recruited to participate. Six VR modules were identified as reflecting the skills tested in the exam. All participants were asked to perform each of the selected modules twice, and median performance was compared between the two groups. Inexperienced endoscopists were subsequently randomized in matched pairs into a repetition (10 repetitions of each task) or proficiency curriculum. After completion of the respective curriculum, FES scores and pass rates were compared to national data and historical institutional control data (endoscopy-rotation training alone). Result(s): Five experienced endoscopists and twenty-three inexperienced endoscopists participated. Construct valid metrics were identified for six modules and proficiency benchmarks were set at the median performance of experienced endoscopists. FES scores of inexperienced endoscopists in the proficiency group had significantly higher FES scores (530 +/- 86) versus historical control (386.7 +/- 92.2, p = 0.0003) and higher pass rate (proficiency: 100%, historical control 61.5%, p = 0.01). Conclusion(s): Trainee engagement in a VR curriculum yields superior FES performance compared to an endoscopy rotation alone. Compared to the 2012-2016 national resident pass rate of 80, 100% of trainees in a proficiency-based curriculum passed the FES manual skills examination.

Shoulder Arthroscopy Simulator Training Improves Surgical Procedure Performance: A Controlled Laboratory Study,"Hauschild, J.; Rivera, J. C.; Johnson, A. E.; Burns, T. C.; Roach, C. J.","Background: Previous simulation studies evaluated either dry lab (DL) or virtual reality (VR) simulation, correlating simulator training with the performance of arthroscopic tasks. However, these studies did not compare simulation training with specific surgical procedures. Purpose/Hypothesis: To determine the effectiveness of a shoulder arthroscopy simulator program in improving performance during arthroscopic anterior labral repair. It was hypothesized that both DL and VR simulation methods would improve procedure performance; however, VR simulation would be more effective based on the validated Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET) Global Rating Scale. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Method(s): Enrolled in the study were 38 orthopaedic residents at a single institution, postgraduate years (PGYs) 1 to 5. Each resident completed a pretest shoulder stabilization procedure on a cadaveric model and was then randomized into 1 of 2 groups: VR or DL simulation. Participants then underwent a 4-week arthroscopy simulation program and completed a posttest. Sports medicine-trained orthopaedic surgeons graded the participants on completeness of the surgical repair at the time of the procedure, and a single, blinded orthopaedic surgeon, using the ASSET Global Rating Scale, graded participants' arthroscopy skills. The procedure step and ASSET grades were compared between simulator groups and between PGYs using paired t tests. Result(s): There was no significant difference between the groups in pretest performance in either the procedural steps or ASSET scores. Overall procedural step scores improved after combining both types of simulator training (P =.0424) but not in the individual simulation groups. The ASSET scores improved across both DL (P =.0045) and VR (P =.0003), with no significant difference between the groups. Conclusion(s): A 4-week simulation program can improve arthroscopic skills and performance during a specific surgical procedure. This study provides additional evidence regarding the benefits of simulator training in orthopaedic surgery for both novice and experienced arthroscopic surgeons. There was no statistically significant difference between the VR and DL models, which disproved the authors' hypothesis that the VR simulator would be the more effective simulation tool. Clinical Relevance: There may be a role for simulator training in the teaching of arthroscopic skills and learning of specific surgical procedures.

J.; Hogdall, C.; Bjerrum, F.","Increasing focus on patient safety makes it important to ensure surgical competency among surgeons before operating on patients. The objective was to gather validity evidence for a virtual-reality simulator test for robotic surgical skills and evaluate its potential as a training tool. Surgeons with varying experience in robotic surgery were recruited: novices (zero procedures), intermediates (1-50), experienced (> 50). Five experienced surgeons rated five exercises on the da Vinci Skills Simulator. Participants were tested using the five exercises. Participants were invited back 3 times and completed a total of 10 attempts per exercise. The outcome was the average simulator performance score for the 5 exercises. 32 participants from 5 surgical specialties were included. 38 participants completed all 4 sessions. A moderate correlation between the average total score and robotic experience was identified for the first attempt (Spearman r = 0.58; p = 0.0004). A difference in average total score was observed between novices and intermediates [median score 61% (IQR 52-66) vs. 83% (IQR 75-91), adjusted p < 0.0001], as well as novices and experienced [median score 61% (IQR 52-66) vs. 80 (IQR 69-85), adjusted p = 0.002]. All three groups improved their performance between the 1st and 10th attempts (p < 0.00). This study describes validity evidence for a virtual-reality simulator for basic robotic surgical skills, which can be used for assessment of basic competency and as a training tool.

The Effects of Computer-Based Simulation Game and Virtual Reality Simulation in Nursing Students' Self-evaluated Clinical Reasoning Skills,"Havola, S.; Haavisto, E.; Makinen, H.; Engblom, J.; Koivisto, J. M.","Research has shown that nursing students can learn clinical reasoning skills by engaging in simulation games. However, there has been no research regarding the effects of simulation games on clinical reasoning skills when nursing students also engage in virtual reality simulations. Furthermore, by engaging in simulation games, neither game metrics nor their impact on students' self-evaluated clinical reasoning skills has been studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of these two kinds of simulation games using a one-group pretest-posttest design. Forty nursing students self-evaluated their clinical reasoning skills in three phases using the Clinical Reasoning Skills scale. Furthermore, the game metrics of the simulation games were analyzed, and the results clearly showed that students' self-evaluated clinical reasoning skills were systematically improved. There was a systematic association between better playing scores and better self-evaluated clinical reasoning skills in playing both kinds of simulation games. Moreover, students engaged more time in the virtual reality simulation than the computer-based simulation game. Overall, the results suggest that the use of a combination of both kinds of simulation games is an effective way for nursing students to learn clinical reasoning skills.

Head-to-Head Comparison of Three Virtual-Reality Robotic Surgery Simulators,"Hertz, A. M.; George, E. I.; Vaccaro, C. M.; Brand, T. C.","Background and Objectives: There are several different commercially available virtual-reality robotic simulators, but very little comparative data. We compared the face and content validity of 3 robotic surgery simulators and their pricing and availability. Methods: Fifteen participants completed one task on each of the following: dV-Trainer (dVT; Mimic Technologies, Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA), da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS; Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, California, USA), and RobotiX Mentor (RM; 3D Systems, Rock Hill, South Carolina, USA). Participants completed previously validated face and content validity questionnaires and a demographics questionnaire. Statistical analysis was then performed on the scores. Results: Participants had a mean age of 29.6 (range, 25-41) years. Most were surgical trainees, having performed a mean of 8.6 robotic primary surgeries. For face validity, ANOVA showed a significant difference favoring the dVSS over the dVT (P = .001), and no significant difference between the RM, dVSS, and dVT. Content validity revealed similar results, with a significant difference between the dVSS and dVT (P = .021), a trend toward a difference between the RM and dVT (P = .092), and no difference between the dVSS and RM (P = .99). Conclusion: All simulators demonstrated evidence of face and content validity, with significantly higher scores for the dVSS; it is also the least costly ($80,000 for the simulator), although it is frequently unavailable because of intra-operative use.

However, it is unclear whether the experiences of actual surgery are reflected in virtual reality simulation surgery (VRSS) using a simulator. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the results in VRSS differ between a trauma expert and a trauma novice. Method(s): In Group A (expert), there are ten orthopaedic trauma surgeons and in Group B (novice) ten residents within 2 years after medical school graduation. VRSS for a femoral neck fracture using Hansson hook-pins (Test 1) and Hansson twin hook plate (Test 2) was performed. The parameters evaluated were total procedure time (s), fluoroscopy time (s), number of times X-ray was used (defined by the number of times the foot pedal was used), number of retries in guide placement, and final implant position. Result(s): In Test 1, the averages of four parameters (distance to posterior cortex (p = 0.009), distal pin distance above lesser trochanter (p = 0.015), distal pin hook angular error (p = 0.004), and distal pin tip distance to centre (lateral) (p = 0.015)) were significantly different between Groups A and B. In Test 2, no parameters in a mean were significantly different between groups, but seven parameters in a variance (guide wire distance to joint surface (p = 0.0191), twin hook length outside barrel (p = 0.011), twin hook tip distance to centre (lateral) (p = 0.042), twin hook distance to centre of lateral cortex (lateral) (p = 0.016), plate end alignment error (lateral) (p = 0.027), guide wire angle with lateral cortex (front) (p = 0.024), and 3.2-mm drill outside cortex (p = 0.000)) were significantly different between groups.

Development and Pilot Implementation of TACTICS VR: A Virtual Reality-Based Stroke Management Workflow Training Application and Training Framework,"Hood, R. J.; Maltby, S.; Keynes, A.; Kluge, M. G.; Nalivaiko, E.; Ryan, A.; Cox, M.; Parsons, M. W.; Paul, C. L.; Garcia-Esperon, C.; Spratt, N. J.; Levi, C. R.; Walker, F. R.","Delays in acute stroke treatment contribute to severe and negative impacts for patients and significant healthcare costs. Variability in clinical care is a contributor to delayed treatment, particularly in rural, regional and remote (RRR) areas. Targeted approaches to improve stroke workflow processes improve outcomes, but numerous challenges exist particularly in RRR settings. Virtual reality (VR) applications can provide immersive and engaging training and overcome some existing training barriers. We recently initiated the TACTICS trial, which is assessing a ""package intervention"" to support advanced CT imaging and streamlined stroke workflow training. As part of the educational component of the intervention we developed TACTICS VR, a novel VR-based training application to upskill healthcare professionals in optimal stroke workflow processes. In the current manuscript, we describe development of the TACTICS VR platform which includes the VR-based training application, a user-facing website and an automated back-end data analytics portal. TACTICS VR was developed via an extensive and structured scoping and consultation process, to ensure content was evidence-based, represented best-practice and is tailored for the target audience. Further, we report on pilot implementation in 7 Australian hospitals to assess the feasibility of workplace-based VR training. A total of 104 healthcare professionals completed TACTICS VR training. Users indicated a high level of usability, acceptability and utility of TACTICS VR, including aspects of hardware, software design, educational content, training feedback and implementation strategy. Further, users self-reported increased confidence in their ability to make improvements in stroke management after TACTICS VR training (post-training mean +/- SD = 4.1 +/- 0.6; pre-training = 3.6 +/- 0.9; 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Very few technical issues were identified, supporting the feasibility of this training approach. Thus, we propose that TACTICS VR is a fit-for-purpose, evidence-based training application for stroke workflow optimisation that can be readily deployed on-site in a clinical setting.

Training for Advanced Endoscopic Imaging in Gastrointestinal Diseases,"Hoogenboom, S. A.; van Hooft, J. E.; Wallace, M. B.","Advanced endoscopic imaging is an emerging field in endoscopy practice, especially in optical diagnosis. Current technologies like virtual chromoendoscopy and small-field technologies allow visualization of subtle changes in mucosal and vascular patterns that are predictive of histology. The limiting factor in broadly utilizing these techniques is training and the need for reliable detection of these subtleties. This review provides the current evidence and limitations of training in advanced endoscopic imaging, and future directions of learning. A literature search was performed on PubMed and Medline through March 2020 with relevant keywords as advanced endoscopic imaging, training, and learning. References of relevant articles were screened for additional literature. Several didactic and web-based education programs are developed for training in virtual chromoendoscopy, autofluorescence imaging, confocal laser endomicroscopy, and volumetric laser endomicroscopy. Studies and post-hoc analysis on learning curves showed relatively steep learning curves after training, and web-based education seems to be as valuable as in-person didactic training for most techniques. However, consistent performance on expert level after training has not yet been demonstrated. Most advanced endoscopic imaging techniques are learned within a reasonable timeframe. Future efforts to enhance training and implementation of these techniques should focus on developing standardized and broadly incorporated training programs. The future role of artificial intelligence-assistance in advanced endoscopy and training has to be elucidated.

A Randomized Comparison of 2 Robotic Virtual Reality Simulators and Evaluation of Trainees' Skills Transfer to a Simulated Robotic Urethrovesical Anastomosis Task,"Hoogenes, J.; Wong, N.; Al-Harbi, B.; Kim, K. S.; Vij, S.; Bolognone, E.; Quantz, M.; Guo, Y.; Shayegan, B.; Matsumoto, E. D.","Objective To determine, via a randomized comparison study, whether robotic simulator-acquired skills transfer to performance of a urethrovesical anastomosis (UVA) on a 3-dimensional-printed bladder model using the da Vinci Robot. Materials and Methods Medical students, surgical residents, and fellows were recruited and divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (G1) (junior trainees) and Group 2 (G2) (senior trainees). Participants were randomized to identical simulator training curricula on the dV-Trainer (dV-T) or da Vinci Surgical Skills Simulator (dVSSS). Participants then completed a UVA task on a 3-dimensional-printed bladder model using the da Vinci robot. Three blinded expert robotic surgeons rated videotaped performances of the UVA task using validated assessment tools, namely, the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS; overall procedure) and Robotic Anastomosis Competence Evaluation (RACE; specific to UVA). Results Thirty-nine participants (G1 = 23 and G2 = 16) completed the study. Participants in G2 had significantly more simulation and surgical experience compared with G1 (P <.05). UVA scores of the dVSSS group were higher compared with dV-T (GEARS: P =.09; RACE: P =.01). In the G1 cohort, dVSSS scores were significantly higher than dV-T (GEARS: P =.01; RACE: P <.01). In the G2 cohort, scores were statistically similar (GEARS: P =.32; RACE: P =.91). Conclusion Compared with the dV-T, the dVSSS training led to superior GEARS and RACE scores for performance of the UVA task in junior trainees, but not in senior trainees. The dVSSS can be used to improve surgical skills acquisition in less experienced trainees in a safe and effective manner.

Virtual Reality Simulation Facilitates Resident Training in Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Hooper, J.; Tsiridis, E.; Feng, J. E.; Schwarzkopf, R.; Waren, D.; Long, W. J.; Poultsides, L.; Macaulay, W.; Papagiannakis, G.; Kenanidis, E.; Rodriguez, E. D.; Slover, J.; Egol, K. A.; Phillips, D. P.; Friedlander, S.; Collins, M.","Background: No study has yet assessed the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) simulation for teaching orthopedic surgery residents. In this blinded, randomized, and controlled trial, we asked if the use of VR simulation improved postgraduate year (PGY)-1 orthopedic residents' performance in cadaver total hip arthroplasty and if the use of VR simulation had a preferentially beneficial effect on specific aspects of surgical skills or knowledge. Method(s): Fourteen PGY-1 orthopedic residents completed a written pretest and a single cadaver total hip arthroplasty (THA) to establish baseline levels of knowledge and surgical ability before 7 were randomized to VR-THA simulation. All participants then completed a second cadaver THA and retook the test to assess for score improvements. The primary outcomes were improvement in test and cadaver THA scores. Result(s): There was no significant difference in the improvement in test scores between the VR and control groups (P = .078). In multivariate regression analysis, the VR cohort demonstrated a significant improvement in overall cadaver THA scores (P = .048). The VR cohort demonstrated greater improvement in each specific score category compared with the control group, but this trend was only statistically significant for technical performance (P = .009). Conclusion(s): VR-simulation improves PGY-1 resident surgical skills but has no significant effect on medical knowledge. The most significant improvement was seen in technical skills. We anticipate that VR simulation will become an indispensable part of orthopedic surgical education, but further study is needed to determine how best to use VR simulation within a comprehensive curriculum.

Virtual surgery simulation versus traditional approaches in training of residents in cervical pedicle screw placement,"Hou, Y.; Shi, J.; Lin, Y.; Chen, H.; Yuan, W.","Introduction: The cervical screw placement is one of the most difficult procedures in spine surgery, which often needs a long period of repeated practices and could cause screw placement-related complications. We performed this cadaver study to investigate the effectiveness of virtual surgical training system (VSTS) on cervical pedicle screw instrumentation for residents. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of ten novice residents were randomly assigned to two groups: the simulation training (ST) group (n = 5) and control group (n = 5). The ST group received a surgical training of cervical pedicle screw placement on VSTS and the control group was given an introductory teaching session before cadaver test. Ten fresh adult spine specimens including 6 males and 4 females were collected, and were randomly allocated to the two groups. The bilateral C3-C6 pedicle screw instrumentation was performed in the specimens of the two groups, respectively. After instrumentation, screw positions of the two groups were evaluated by image examinations. Result(s): There was significantly statistical difference in screw penetration rates between the ST (10%) and control group (62.5%, P < 0.05). The acceptable rates of screws were 100 and 50% in the ST and control groups with significant difference between each other (P < 0.05). In addition, the average screw penetration distance in the ST group (1.12 +/- 0.47 mm) was significantly lower than the control group (2.08 +/- 0.39 mm, P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that the VSTS as an advanced training tool exhibited promising effects on improving performance of novice residents in cervical pedicle screw placement compared with the traditional teaching methods.

"Validity evidence for procedural competency in virtual reality robotic simulation, establishing a credible pass/fail standard for the vaginal cuff closure procedure","Hovgaard, L. H.; Andersen, S. A. W.; Konge, L.; Dalsgaard, T.; Larsen, C. R.","Background: The use of robotic surgery for minimally invasive procedures has increased considerably over the last decade. Robotic surgery has potential advantages compared to laparoscopic surgery but also requires new skills. Using virtual reality (VR) simulation to facilitate the acquisition of these new skills could potentially benefit training of robotic surgical skills and also be a crucial step in developing a robotic surgical training curriculum. The study's objective was to establish validity evidence for a simulation-based test for procedural competency for the vaginal cuff closure procedure that can be used in a future simulation-based, mastery learning training curriculum. Method(s): Eleven novice gynaecological surgeons without prior robotic experience and 11 experienced gynaecological robotic surgeons (> 30 robotic procedures) were recruited. After familiarization with the VR simulator, participants completed the module 'Guided Vaginal Cuff Closure' six times. Validity evidence was investigated for 18 preselected simulator metrics. The internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and a composite score was calculated based on metrics with significant discriminative ability between the two groups. Finally, a pass/fail standard was established using the contrasting groups' method. Result(s): The experienced surgeons significantly outperformed the novice surgeons on 6 of the 18 metrics. The internal consistency was 0.58 (Cronbach's alpha). The experienced surgeons' mean composite score for all six repetitions were significantly better than the novice surgeons' (76.1 vs. 63.0, respectively, p < 0.001). A pass/fail standard of 75/100 was established. Four novice surgeons passed this standard (false positives) and three experienced surgeons failed (false negatives). Conclusion(s): Our study has gathered validity evidence for a simulation-based test for procedural robotic surgical competency in the vaginal cuff closure procedure and established a credible pass/fail standard for future proficiency-based training.

Teaching Disaster Evacuation Management Education to Nursing Students Using Virtual Reality Mobile Game-Based Learning,"Hu, H.; Lai, X.; Li, H.; Nyland, J.","The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of a virtual reality mobile game-based application for teaching disaster evacuation management education to nursing students. A pre-test, post-test, and final-test study design was used to compare traditional lecture group and game group instructional knowledge delivery effectiveness and instructional mode satisfaction. The statistical comparison of pre-test and post-test knowledge and decision-making scores did not reveal significant group differences for short-term improvement (P >= .05); however, final test scores revealed that the virtual reality mobile game-based application group had significantly higher knowledge and decision-making retention scores compared with the traditional lecture group (P = .000). The game group also had significantly higher instructional mode satisfaction scores for course interest and cooperation with others (P < .05). The virtual reality mobile game-based application was more effective for teaching nursing students about disaster evacuation management educational training than lecture instruction. The greater satisfaction expressed by nursing students when using this instructional mode suggests that it may better facilitate self-initiated lifelong disaster evacuation learning behaviors.

Impact of virtual reality anatomy training on ultrasound competency development: A randomized controlled trial,"Hu, K. C.; Salcedo, D.; Kang, Y. N.; Lin, C. W.; Hsu, C. W.; Cheng, C. Y.; Suk, F. M.; Huang, W. C.","Purpose The use of Virtual Reality (VR) in health professions education has increased dramatically in recent years, yet there is limited evidence of its impact on educational outcomes. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of VR anatomy instruction on the ultrasound competency of novice learners participating in a ultrasonography workshop. Method We designed a VR-enhanced ultrasonography training program and utilized a plane transection tool to interact with a three-dimensional (3D) VR model of the human body which facilitated the 3D conceptualization of the spatial relationship of anatomical structures, leading to faster and better development of ultrasonographic competency. This was a randomized control study which enrolled third-year medical students (n = 101) without previous exposure to formal or informal ultrasonography training. The participants were randomly divided into an intervention and control group. We assessed participants' competency through ultrasound performance stations on live subjects, we also measured anatomical and ultrasound image identification ability using multiple choice tests. Result Participants in the intervention group (median = 16; interquartile 13 to 19) had significantly higher scores in ultrasonography task performance tests than the control group (median = 10; interquartile 7 to 14; Mann-Whitney U = 595; P < 0.01). In sub-group analysis, the intervention group performed significantly better in the six out of ten ultrasound tasks. Participants in the intervention group also had greater improvement in ultrasonographic image identification MCQ tests than the control group (Mann-Whitney U = 914; P < 0.05). Conclusion This study suggests that VR-enhanced anatomical training could be of significant benefit in ultrasonography training by promoting a better understanding of the spatial relationships of anatomical structures and the development of early psychomotor skills transferable to the handling of ultrasonographic probes.

Increasing Empathy for Children in Dental Students Using Virtual Reality,"Hu, S.; Lai, B. W. P.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) can be used to simulate the view-point of a child to allow dental students to experience what a child experiences during a dental visit. AIM: This study evaluated the effect of VR simulation on the empathy and comfort managing children among dental students. DESIGN: Sixty dental students experienced a VR scenario created for the study. Empathy levels were examined using the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE). A self-administered questionnaire collected information on self-perceived ability, comfort, and impact of the intervention. RESULT(S): There was a significant (p=0.004) increase (indicating greater empathy) in JSE scores between Pre-intervention (112.35+/-9.34) and Post-intervention (117.64+/-10.03), which returned to baseline 3 months later (112.72+/-10.36). Dental students perceived themselves to be more confident at communicating (6.45+/-1.64 Vs 5.75+/-1.71, p=0.011) and interacting (6.63+/-1.44 Vs 6.00+/-1.78, p=0.046) with children after intervention. All (100%) felt that the VR scenarios helped them better empathize with children. Only 30% revised with the scenario and they were significantly more likely (p<0.001) to find it helpful for actual clinical sessions. CONCLUSION(S): VR could be used to improve empathy, self-perceived comfort and ability at managing children in dental students. However, they should be encouraged to revise using it to maintain this effect. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

Virtual Reality Simulator for Training in Myringotomy with Tube Placement,"Huang, C.; Agrawal, S. K.; Ladak, H. M.","Myringotomy refers to a surgical incision in the eardrum, and it is often followed by placement of a ventilation tube into the incision as part of the treatment of middle-ear infections. Although it is one of the first procedures learned by surgical residents in otolaryngology, it is difficult to master because of the need to work in the narrow confines of the ear canal under a microscope. Consequences of surgical errors include bleeding, trauma, and hearing loss. We previously introduced virtual reality (VR)-based simulators for training on various aspects of myringotomy; however, a complete simulator that includes an interactive microscope, speculum positioning, and tube placement has not been developed. In this paper, a VR-based simulator is implemented to simulate all surgical aspects of myrintogomy and tube placement. A unique aspect of this implementation is the use of a commercially available digital gaming engine to capitalize on its support for graphical rendering and physics computations. The simulated anatomy was derived from medical images and could be viewed in stereo 3D with photorealistic quality. A haptic arm co-located with the stereo scene was used to manipulate virtual surgical tools and to interact with the virtual ear with force feedback. Quantitative performance tests on the simulator demonstrate that the procedure can be simulated in real time. Qualitative feedback from instructing ear surgeons indicates that the models are anatomically accurate and contain all landmarks necessary for surgical training. Although initial impressions of simulated speculum placement, microscope positioning, eardrum cutting, and tube insertion are positive, extensive validation is planned to quantify realism and training effects.

Impact of Nurse Practitioners and Nursing Education on COVID-19 Pandemics: Innovative Strategies of Authentic Technology-Integrated Clinical Simulation. [Chinese],"Huang, C. L.","Taiwan Nurses Association and the International Council of Nurses recognize nurse practitioners (NPs) as advanced-practice nurses. A total of 11,266 registered nurses held NP certificates in April 2021 in Taiwan (Tsay, 2021). While international organizations recognize NPs with graduate degrees, over 85% of NPs in Taiwan hold a bachelor degree only. Tsay and Wang (2007) emphasized that NP education in Taiwan should be in step with international trends. Therefore, nursing schools must recruit PhD faculty who hold NP certificates. In addition, complicated and simulation-based learning procedures and teaching plans must be incorporated into the graduate curriculum and clinical practicum to promote the clinical reasoning competences and advanced nursing capabilities of NPs in light of professional training, qualifying examinations, and occupational practice. With the evolution of virtual technology, the strategies for teaching core competences in nursing education have shifted from traditional classroom lectures to online format simulation. Recently, scholars have begun using authentic technology-enhanced clinical simulation to develop and integrate nursing competence to reconceptualize the gap between theory and practice (Weeks et al., 2019). It is increasingly important to teach patient safety, clinical reasoning, and decision-making skills to nursing students using the assistive methods of clinical simulation technology (Aebersold, 2016; Johnsen et al., 2016). Since 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact. In May 2021, clinical practice settings and university campuses in Taiwan were closed following the announcement of a nationwide, level-3 epidemic alert. The Ministry of Education and Taiwan Nurses Association approved the replacement of up to 50% of clinical practicum hours with alternative learning activities. Therefore, faculties require innovative strategies to teach requisite skills and deliver clinical practica online. The faculty members of California State University use virtual clinical education and standardized patient-based telehealth simulations (Shea & Rovera, 2021). In Taiwan, there is a lack of studies in the literature examining the effect of replacing 50% of traditional face-to-face clinical activities with educational alternatives. Prior survey results have demonstrated the efficacy of transitioning to virtual clinical experiences in an online environment for undergraduate and graduate students (Fogg et al., 2020). Moreover, a systematic review provided evidence that virtual simulations support learning outcomes (Foronda et al., 2020). To promote clinical-reasoning competence in graduate students with NP certificates and prepare alternative, virtual-based teaching plans to meet the remaining clinical hours required of students, Fooyin University's School of Nursing has recently established the multi-functional iNursing-Innovative Learning Center. The hardware devices provide interactive virtual patients with character creator 3D, augmented realty (AR) hospital, operating room, intensive care unit, and virtual reality (VR) simulation plans for different nursing divisions as well as editors of electronic book and AR/VR teaching plans. The simulation plans include commercial products and self-design produced by well-trained faculty members. A group of seeding faculty members supported by the Ministry of Education's Higher Education Sprout Project and university funding was tapped to develop a large number of virtual simulation plans. In addition, when developing virtual simulation, it is necessary to follow teaching team discussion and learning objective setting procedures, pre-brief teachers and students, enact plans, conduct debriefing, and collect and evaluate data to explore the learning and teaching process and outcomes (Verkuyl et al., 2021). The nursing clinical practicum continues to be impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In a further study, nursing academic faculty cooperated with clinical preceptors to develop and design education strategies using authentic technology-i tegrated clinical simulations to promote advanced and comprehensive care competences in nurse practitioners.",2021,1-Oct,Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,68(5),,6-Apr,636203332,,,#2191,Huang 2021,,
Combining Metrics From Clinical Simulators and Sensorimotor Tasks Can Reveal the Training Background of Surgeons,"Huang, F. C.; Mohamadipanah, H.; Mussa-Ivaldi, F. A.; Pugh, C. M.","BACKGROUND: Skill assessment in surgery traditionally has relied on the expert observation and qualitative scoring. Our novel study design demonstrates how analysis of performance in sensorimotor tasks and bench-top surgical simulators can provide inferences about the technical proficiency as well as the training history of surgeons. METHOD(S): We examined metrics for basic sensorimotor tasks in a virtual reality interface as well as motion metrics in clinical scenario simulations. As indicators of the training level, we considered survey responses from surgery residents, including the number of postgraduation years (PGY, four levels), research years (RY, three levels), and clinical years (CY, three levels). Next, we performed a linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation (90% training, 10% testing) to relate the training levels to the selected metrics. RESULT(S): Using combined metrics from all stations, we found greater than chance predictions for each survey category, with an overall accuracy of 43.4 +/- 2.9% for identifying the level for post-graduate years, 79.1 +/- 1.0% accuracy for research training years, and 64.2 +/- 1.0% for clinical training years. Our main finding was that combining metrics from all stations resulted in more accurate predictions than using only sensorimotor or clinical scenario tasks. In addition, we found that metrics related to the ability to cope with changes in the task environment were the most important predictors of training level. CONCLUSION(S): These results suggest that each simulator-type provided crucial information for evaluating surgical proficiency. The methods developed in this paper could improve evaluations of a surgeon's clinical proficiency as well as training potential in terms of basic sensorimotor ability.",2019,1-Sep,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,66(9),,2576-2584,629159924,,,#2193,Huang 2019,,

"Three-dimensional printing model improves morphological understanding in acetabular fracture learning: A multicenter, randomized, controlled study","Huang, Z.; Song, W.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, Q.; Zhou, D.; Zhou, X.; He, Y.","Conventional education results in unsatisfactory morphological understanding of acetabular fractures due to lack of three-dimensional (3D) details and tactile feedback of real fractures. Virtual reality (VR) and 3D printing (3DP) techniques are widely applied in teaching. The purpose of this study was to identify the effect of physical model (PM), VR and 3DP models in education of morphological understanding of acetabular fractures. 141 students were invited to participate in this study. Participants were equally and randomly assigned to the PM, VR and 3DP learning groups. Three-level objective tests were conducted to evaluate learning, including identifying anatomical landmarks, describing fracture lines, identifying classification, and inferring fracture mechanism. Four subjective questions were asked to evaluate the usability and value of instructional materials. Generally, the 3DP group showed a clear advantage over the PM and VR groups in objective tests, while there was no significant difference between the PM and VR groups. 3DP was considered to be the most valuable learning tool for understanding acetabular fractures. The findings demonstrate that 3DP modelling of real fractures is an effective learning instrument that can be used to understand the morphology of acetabular fractures and promote subjective interest.

Comparison of a virtual reality compression-only Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) course to the traditional course with content validation of the VR course - A randomized control pilot study,"Hubail, D.; Mondal, A.; Al Jabir, A.; Patel, B.","Introduction: Technology has been a major contributor to recent changes in education, where simulation plays a huge role by providing a unique safe environment, especially with the recent incorporation of immersive virtual reality (VR) training. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is said to double, even triple survival from cardiac arrest, and hence it is crucial to ensure optimal acquisition and retention of these skills. In this study, we aim to compare a VR CPR teaching program to current teaching methods with content validation of the VR course. Method(s): A randomized single-blinded simulation-based pilot study where 26 participants underwent baseline assessment of their CPR skills using a validated checklist and Laerdal QCPR. Participants were randomly allocated and underwent their respective courses. This was followed by a final assessment and a questionnaire for content validation, knowledge and confidence. The data was analysed using STATA 16.2 to determine the standardized mean difference using paired and unpaired t-test. Result(s): Subjective assessment using the checklist showed statistically significant improvement in the overall scores of both groups (traditional group mean improved from 6.92 to 9.61 p-value 0.0005, VR group from 6.61 to 8.53 p-value 0.0016). However, no statistically significant difference was noted between the final scores in both the subjective and objective assessments. As for the questionnaire, knowledge and confidence seemed to improve equally. Finally, the content validation showed statistically significant improvement in ease of use (mean score 3 to 4.23 p-value of 0.0144), while for content, positivity of experience, usefulness and appropriateness participants showed similar satisfaction before and after use. Conclusion(s): This pilot study suggests that VR teaching could deliver CPR skills in an attractive manner, with no inferiority in acquisition of these skills compared to traditional methods. To corroborate these findings, we suggest a follow-up study with a larger sample size after adding ventilation and Automated External Defibrillator (AED) skills to the VR course with re-examination after 3-6 months to test retention of the skills.

Evaluation of a New Virtual Reality Concept Teaching K-Wire Drilling With Force Feedback Simulated Haptic in Orthopedic Skills Training,"Huber, M.; Katzky, U.; Muller, K.; Blatzinger, M.; Goetz, W.; Grechenig, P.; Popp, D.; Angerpointner, K.","Purpose: Surgical simulations are becoming increasingly relevant in musculoskeletal training. They provide the opportunity to develop surgical skills in a controlled environment while reducing the risks for patients. For K-wire internal fixation in musculoskeletal surgery, a force feedback virtual reality (VR) simulator was developed. The aim of this study was to evaluate training results using this technology and compare the results with that of standard teaching on cadavers. Method(s): Twenty participants attending an AO Trauma Course during 2020 were randomly allocated in 2 groups. On day 1, group A was trained by senior surgeons using a cadaver and group B was trained by the VR simulator for K-wire insertion in the distal radius. On day 2, all participants performed K-wire insertion on the cadaver model, without assistance, to validate the training effect. Result(s): On a surgical skills test, group B performed better than group A. In group B, the entry point of the first K-wire was closer to the targeted styloid process of the radius, and the protrusion of the K-wires into soft tissue was less than that in group A. Conclusion(s): Training with the VR simulator for K-wire insertion resulted in better surgical skills than training by a surgeon and cadaver model. Clinical relevance: Training with the VR simulator provides the opportunity to improve and refine surgical skills without the risk of harming patients. It offers easier access, unlimited repetitions, and is more cost-effective compared with training sessions with cadavers.

Artificial Versus Video-Based Immersive Virtual Surroundings: Analysis of Performance and User's Preference,"Huber, T.; Paschold, M.; Hansen, C.; Lang, H.; Kneist, W.","Introduction. Immersive virtual reality (VR) laparoscopy simulation connects VR simulation with head-mounted displays to increase presence during VR training. The goal of the present study was the comparison of 2 different surroundings according to performance and users' preference. Methods. With a custom immersive virtual reality laparoscopy simulator, an artificially created VR operating room (AVR) and a highly immersive VR operating room (IVR) were compared. Participants (n = 30) performed 3 tasks (peg transfer, fine dissection, and cholecystectomy) in AVR and IVR in a crossover study design. Results. No overall difference in virtual laparoscopic performance was obtained when comparing results from AVR with IVR. Most participants preferred the IVR surrounding (n = 24). Experienced participants (n = 10) performed significantly better than novices (n = 10) in all tasks regardless of the surrounding (P <.05). Participants with limited experience (n = 10) showed differing results. Presence, immersion, and exhilaration were significantly higher in IVR. Two thirds assumed that IVR would have a positive influence on their laparoscopic simulator use. Conclusion. This first study comparing AVR and IVR did not reveal differences in virtual laparoscopic performance. IVR is considered the more realistic surrounding and is therefore preferred by the participants.

New dimensions in surgical training: immersive virtual reality laparoscopic simulation exhilarates surgical staff,"Huber, T.; Paschold, M.; Hansen, C.; Wunderling, T.; Lang, H.; Kneist, W.","Introduction: Virtual reality (VR) and head mount displays (HMDs) have been advanced for multimedia and information technologies but have scarcely been used in surgical training. Motion sickness and individual psychological changes have been associated with VR. The goal was to observe first experiences and performance scores using a new combined highly immersive virtual reality (IVR) laparoscopy setup. Method(s): During the study, 10 members of the surgical department performed three tasks (fine dissection, peg transfer, and cholecystectomy) on a VR simulator. We then combined a VR HMD with the VR laparoscopic simulator and displayed the simulation on a 360degree video of a laparoscopic operation to create an IVR laparoscopic simulation. The tasks were then repeated. Validated questionnaires on immersion and motion sickness were used for the study. Result(s): Participants' times for fine dissection were significantly longer during the IVR session (regular: 86.51 s [62.57 s; 119.62 s] vs. IVR: 112.35 s [82.08 s; 179.40 s]; p = 0.022). The cholecystectomy task had higher error rates during IVR. Motion sickness did not occur at any time for any participant. Participants experienced a high level of exhilaration, rarely thought about others in the room, and had a high impression of presence in the generated IVR world. Conclusion(s): This is the first clinical and technical feasibility study using the full IVR laparoscopy setup combined with the latest laparoscopic simulator in a 360degree surrounding. Participants were exhilarated by the high level of immersion. The setup enables a completely new generation of surgical training.

Highly immersive virtual reality laparoscopy simulation: development and future aspects,"Huber, T.; Wunderling, T.; Paschold, M.; Lang, H.; Kneist, W.; Hansen, C.","Purpose: Virtual reality (VR) applications with head-mounted displays (HMDs) have had an impact on information and multimedia technologies. The current work aimed to describe the process of developing a highly immersive VR simulation for laparoscopic surgery. Method(s): We combined a VR laparoscopy simulator (LapSim) and a VR-HMD to create a user-friendly VR simulation scenario. Continuous clinical feedback was an essential aspect of the development process. We created an artificial VR (AVR) scenario by integrating the simulator video output with VR game components of figures and equipment in an operating room. We also created a highly immersive VR surrounding (IVR) by integrating the simulator video output with a 360 <sup></sup> video of a standard laparoscopy scenario in the department's operating room. Results : Clinical feedback led to optimization of the visualization, synchronization, and resolution of the virtual operating rooms (in both the IVR and the AVR). Preliminary testing results revealed that individuals experienced a high degree of exhilaration and presence, with rare events of motion sickness. The technical performance showed no significant difference compared to that achieved with the standard LapSim. Conclusion : Our results provided a proof of concept for the technical feasibility of an custom highly immersive VR-HMD setup. Future technical research is needed to improve the visualization, immersion, and capability of interacting within the virtual scenario.

The impact of virtual reality simulation training on operative performance in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials,"Humm, G.; Mohan, H.; Fleming, C.; Harries, R.; Wood, C.; Dawas, K.; Stoyanov, D.; Lovat, L. B.","BACKGROUND: Simulation training can improve the learning curve of surgical trainees. This research aimed to systematically review randomized clinical trials (RCT) evaluating the performance of junior surgical trainees following virtual reality training (VRT) and other training methods in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHOD(S): MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid SP), Web of Science, Scopus and LILACS were searched for trials randomizing participants to VRT or no additional training (NAT) or simulation training (ST). Outcomes of interest were the reported performance using global rating scores (GRS), the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) and Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS), error counts and time to completion of task during laparoscopic cholecystectomy on either porcine models or humans. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020208499. RESULT(S): A total of 351 titles/abstracts were screened and 96 full texts were reviewed. Eighteen RCT were included and 15 manuscripts had data available for meta-analysis. Thirteen studies compared VRT and NAT, and 4 studies compared VRT and ST. One study compared VRT with NAT and ST and reported GRS only. Meta-analysis showed OSATS score (mean difference (MD) 6.22, 95%CI 3.81 to 8.36, P<0.001) and time to completion of task (MD -8.35 min, 95%CI 13.10 to 3.60, P=<0.001) significantly improved after VRT compared with NAT. No significant difference was found in GOALS score. No significant differences were found between VRT and ST groups. Intraoperative errors were reported as reduced in VRT groups compared with NAT but were not suitable for meta-analysis. CONCLUSION(S): Meta-analysis suggests that performance measured by OSATS and time to completion of task is improved with VRT compared with NAT for junior trainee in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, conclusions are limited by methodological heterogeneity and more research is needed to quantify the potential benefit to surgical training. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

Cadaver versus simulator based arthroscopic training in shoulder surgery,"Huri, G.; Gulsen, M. R.; Karmis, E. B.; Karaguven, D.","Introduction: There are few studies that compare the cadaver dissections with the medical simulators in means of talent improvement. Therefore, the aim of this study is to find out if using cadaver dissections is still the golden standard for surgical training or using the medical simulators in surgery could replace cadaver dissections. Material(s) and Method(s): The study is conducted during the European Orthopaedics & Traumatology Education Platform accredited Shoulder Club International Cadaver Course including a number of 34 orthopedics trainees. The participants were randomly divided into two groups to be trained with the simulator (Group 1) and on cadavers (Group 2), followed by a test performed on shoulder arthroscopy simulator (Virtamed ArthroS, Switzerland). There was no conflict of interest before, during, or after the study. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Result(s): Group 2 had statistically significant higher simulation overview procedure time values than Group 1 (p < 0.05), the meaning of which is participants trained with the simulator completed the given tasks in a shorter period of time. Group 2 had statistically significant higher scratching of humerus cartilage values than Group 1 (p < 0.05), which means that participants trained with simulation have less scratching done on the humerus cartilage than the participants trained on a cadaver. Conclusion(s): To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to compare virtual reality (VR) simulators with cadavers for surgical education in an objective manner, while using qualitative and quantitative data. According to this study, it is possible to state that VR simulators are just as effective as cadavers in means of training subjects. As medical education will face a total change all around the world after the COVID-19 pandemic, this study has the potential to be an important guide during and after this period.

Effectiveness of the Infectious Disease (COVID-19) Simulation Module Program on Nursing Students: Disaster Nursing Scenarios,"Hwang, W. J.; Lee, J.","PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop an emerging infectious disease (COVID-19) simulation module for nursing students and verify its effectiveness. METHOD(S): A one-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted with 78 under-graduate nursing students. A simulation module was developed based on the Jeffries simulation model. It consisted of pre-simulation lectures on disaster nursing including infectious disease pandemics, practice, and debriefings with serial tests. The scenarios contained pre-hospital settings, home visits, arrival to the emergency department, and follow-up home visits for rehabilitation. RESULT(S): Disaster preparedness showed a statistically significant improvement, as did competencies in disaster nursing. Confidence in disaster nursing increased, as did willingness to participate in disaster response. However, critical thinking did not show significant differences between time points, and neither did triage scores. CONCLUSION(S): The developed simulation program targeting an infectious disease disaster positively impacts disaster preparedness, disaster nursing competency, and confidence in disaster nursing, among nursing students. Further studies are required to develop a high-fidelity module for nursing students and medical personnel. Based on the current pandemic, we suggest developing more scenarios with virtual reality simulations, as disaster simulation nursing education is required now more than ever.

Practical emergency ultrasound flashcards with augmented reality in teaching point-of-care ultrasound in ER,"Ienghong, K.; Kotruchin, P.; Tangpaisarn, T.; Apiratwarakul, K.","BACKGROUND: The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has recently proposed the integration of ultrasound into undergraduate medical education. However, the evidence of learning tool for this integration has not been well studied. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the levels of knowledge improvement of the 6<sup>th</sup> year medical students before and after receiving the POCUS training in two ways: By employing the traditional methods and by utilizing the new learning tool. METHOD(S): The practical ultrasound flashcards were developed by a Thai physician. In the study, the 6<sup>th</sup> year medical students were enrolled and randomized to become members of either the flashcard group or the control group. Participants in both groups attended a 4-week ultrasound training course. Before and after the training course, all students were evaluated using the multiple-choice questions. In addition, the subjects' attitudes and perceptions about the flashcards were evaluated using a questionnaire. RESULT(S): A total of 46 students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to either the flashcard group (n = 23) or the control group (n = 23). It was discovered that the students in the flashcard group had performed better on the POCUS knowledge post-test than those in the control group had. Most students had been satisfied with the flashcards (mean 5 Likert scores = 4.48). However, the students had rated their confidence score to perform POCUS at 3.96 out of 5.0. CONCLUSION(S): Medical students who used the ultrasound flashcards to learn POCUS had resulted in better knowledge scores rather than the others who attended the standard ultrasound training course only. However, it was not possible to evaluate the practical skills and the clinical decision-making processes in this study.

Incorporation of virtual reality in the clinical training of medical students studying esophageal and mediastinal anatomy and surgery,"Imai, T.; Tanaka, Y.; Hatanaka, Y.; Suetsugu, T.; Sato, Y.; Matsuhashi, N.; Tsunekawa, K.; Saiki, T.; Yoshida, K.","Purpose: To analyze the effectiveness of incorporating virtual reality (VR) in lectures on esophageal and mediastinal anatomy and surgical procedures for medical students at Gifu University during clinical training. Method(s): We divided medical students participating in clinical training, randomly, into two groups of 30 students each: those who received a lecture using 3D images (3D group) and those who received a lecture using VR images (VR group). Four days after the lecture, the students completed a written test to allow us to evaluate their comprehension, and a questionnaire on their opinion of the lectures. Result(s): Based on the results of the written test, the VR group achieved better understanding of computed tomography (CT) images (p = 0.0001) and better interpretation of surgical images (p = 0.0163). However, there was no difference in the scores for spatial recognition and general problems. The questionnaire revealed that the VR group became more interested in mediastinal anatomy (p = 0.0165) and surgery (p = 0.0135). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that VR enhances the learning process. The lecture incorporating the VR experience was more effective than the traditional lecture for promoting an understanding of CT images and interpretation of surgical images; thus, it enhances the learning experience for medical students studying surgery.

Augmented reality learning environment for basic life support and defibrillation training: Usability study,"Ingrassia, P. L.; Mormando, G.; Giudici, E.; Strada, F.; Carfagna, F.; Lamberti, F.; Bottino, A.","Background: Basic life support (BLS) is crucial in the emergency response system, as sudden cardiac arrest is still a major cause of death worldwide. Unfortunately, only a minority of victims receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from bystanders. In this context, training could be helpful to save more lives, and technology-enhanced BLS simulation is one possible solution. Objective(s): The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of our augmented reality (AR) prototype as a tool for BLS training. Method(s): Holo-BLSD is an AR self-instruction training system, in which a standard CPR manikin is ""augmented"" with an interactive virtual environment that reproduces realistic scenarios. Learners can use natural gestures, body movements, and spoken commands to perform their tasks, with virtual 3D objects anchored to the manikin and the environment. During the experience, users were trained to use the device while being guided through an emergency simulation and, at the end, were asked to complete a survey to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed tool (5-point Likert scale; 1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree). Result(s): The system was rated easy to use (mean 4.00, SD 0.94), and the trainees stated that most people would learn to use it very quickly (mean 4.00, SD 0.89). Voice (mean 4.48, SD 0.87), gaze (mean 4.12, SD 0.97), and gesture interaction (mean 3.84, SD 1.14) were judged positively, although some hand gesture recognition errors reduced the feeling of having the right level of control over the system (mean 3.40, SD 1.04). Conclusion(s): We found the Holo-BLSD system to be a feasible and acceptable tool for AR BLS training.

Comparison of Experts and Residents Performing a Complex Procedure in a Temporal Bone Surgery Simulator,"Ioannou, I.; Zhou, Y.; Wijewickrema, S.; Piromchai, P.; Copson, B.; Kennedy, G.; O'Leary, S.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of automated metrics from a virtual reality (VR) temporal bone surgery simulator to determine how the performance of experts and trainees differs when performing a complex otological procedure (mastoidectomy with posterior tympanotomy and cochleostomy). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: Using the University of Melbourne VR temporal bone surgery simulator, seven ENT consultants and seven ENT residents performed two trials of the surgical approach to cochlear implantation on a virtual temporal bone. Simulator recordings were used to calculate a range of automated metrics for each stage of the procedure, capturing efficiency, technique characteristics, drilled bone regions, and damage to vital anatomical structures. RESULTS: Results confirm that experts drilled more efficiently than residents. Experts generally used larger burrs and applied higher forces, resulting in faster material removal. However, they exercised more caution when drilling close to anatomical structures. Residents opened the temporal bone more widely, but neglected important steps in obtaining a clear view toward the round window, such as thinning the external ear canal wall and skeletonizing the medial aspect of the facial nerve. Residents used higher magnification and reoriented the temporal bone more often than experts. CONCLUSION: VR simulation provides metrics that allow the objective analysis of surgical technique, and identification of differences between the performance of surgical residents and their senior colleagues. The performance of residents could be improved with more guidance regarding how much force they should apply, what burr size they should use, how they should orient the bone, and for cochlear implant surgery guidance regarding anatomical regions requiring particular attention, to visualize the round window.",2017,1-Jul,"Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",38(6),,e85-e91,620498021,,,#2280,Ioannou 2017,,
The pathway to a national vascular skills examination and the role of simulation-based training in an increasingly complex specialty,"Irfan, W.; Sheahan, C.; Mitchell, E. L.; Sheahan, M. G.","The evolving demands of surgical training have led to the successful implementation of skills examinations in the areas of laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery. Currently, there is no similar formal skills assessment in vascular surgery, despite endovascular intervention replacing open surgery in treatment of many vascular conditions. The adoption of less invasive techniques to treat aneurysm and occlusive disease has resulted in new training paradigms and technical challenges for trainees. The duty hour restriction for trainees and declining numbers of complex open vascular interventions have added to the challenges of vascular surgery training. Simulation is a promising avenue for both skills training and assessment. The ability to evaluate the fundamental skills of trainees would be an important step to ensure a degree of uniformity in trainees' technical abilities. The role of simulation-based training in acquiring, testing, and refining these skills is still in its infancy in the vascular surgery training paradigm. This article aims to impart a deeper understanding of the conditions for developing and implementing the fundamentals of vascular and endovascular surgery, and to provide guidance regarding the role of simulation-based training in a rapidly evolving specialty. There are various forms of simulation available, including benchtop models, high-fidelity simulators, and virtual-reality simulators, and each requires a different method of proficiency assessment. Both open surgery and endovascular skills can be assessed and the application of successful implementation in academic vascular surgery training program is presented.

To date, this is the first review that investigates the current state of VR/AR technology applied more broadly to the entire field of ophthalmology. METHOD(S): PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched systematically from January 2014 through December 1, 2020. Studies that discussed VR and/or AR as it relates to the field of ophthalmology and provided information on the technology used were considered. Abstracts, non-peer-reviewed literature, review articles, studies that reported only qualitative data, and studies without English translations were excluded. RESULT(S): A total of 77 studies were included in this review. Of these, 28 evaluated the use of VR/AR in ophthalmic surgical training/assessment and guidance, 7 in clinical training, 23 in diagnosis/screening, and 19 in treatment/therapy. 15 studies used AR, 61 used VR, and 1 used both. Most studies focused on the validity and usability of novel technologies. CONCLUSION(S): Ophthalmology is a field of medicine that is well suited for the use of VR/AR. However, further longitudinal studies examining the practical feasibility, efficacy, and safety of such novel technologies, the cost-effectiveness, and medical/legal considerations are still needed.

Comparison of the effectiveness of the virtual simulator and video-assisted teaching on intravenous catheter insertion skills and self-confidence: A quasi-experimental study,"Ismailoglu, E. G.; Orkun, N.; Eser, I.; Zaybak, A.","BACKGROUND: With the advancement of technology, methods such as clinical scenarios, role playing, video demonstration and simulation are now used to develop psychomotor skills in nursing education. Virtual reality and video-assisted teaching are useful technologies for the development of skills and self-confidence. In the literature, there is a lack of studies comparing the effects of the two methods. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of study is to compare the effect of the virtual simulator and video assisted teaching on the level of intravenous catheterization skills and self-confidence of nursing students. Thus, students are enabled to develop skills and work efficiently without the need for an instructor. METHOD(S): This study was a randomized controlled quasi-experimental study. A total of 60 students was included in the study (30 in the virtual simulator group and 30 in the video group). In the virtual simulator group, each student performed an intravenous catheter insertion in the virtual intravenous simulator. In the video group, each student watched a training video on the peripheral intravenous catheterization skill in a classroom setting. Each of the students' level of intravenous catheterization knowledge, psychomotor skill and self-confidence score was evaluated. RESULT(S): Post-test knowledge scores was higher than pretest knowledge scores for both groups. There were no significant difference between the groups in terms of post-test scores. Students' scores of psychomotor skills were found to be higher in the virtual simulator group and self-confidence scores were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Teaching with the virtual simulator contributed to the students' skills more than the method used in the video training.

Virtual reality as a teaching method for resuscitation training in undergraduate first year medical students: a randomized controlled trial,"Issleib, M.; Kromer, A.; Pinnschmidt, H. O.; Suss-Havemann, C.; Kubitz, J. C.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality is an innovative technology for medical education associated with high empirical realism. Therefore, this study compares a conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training with a Virtual Reality (VR) training aiming to demonstrate: (a) non-inferiority of the VR intervention in respect of no flow time and (b) superiority in respect of subjective learning gain. METHOD(S): In this controlled randomized study first year, undergraduate students were allocated in the intervention group and the control group. Fifty-six participants were randomized to the intervention group and 104 participants to the control group. The intervention group received an individual 35-min VR Basic Life Support (BLS) course and a basic skill training. The control group took part in a ""classic"" BLS-course with a seminar and a basic skill training. The groups were compared in respect of no flow time in a final 3-min BLS examination (primary outcome) and their learning gain (secondary outcome) assessed with a comparative self-assessment (CSA) using a questionnaire at the beginning and the end of the course. Data analysis was performed with a general linear fixed effects model. RESULT(S): The no flow time was significantly shorter in the control group (Mean values: control group 82s vs. intervention group 93s; p=0.000). In the CSA participants of the intervention group had a higher learning gain in 6 out of 11 items of the questionnaire (p<0.05). CONCLUSION(S): A ""classic"" BLS-course with a seminar and training seems superior to VR in teaching technical skills. However, overall learning gain was higher with VR. Future BLS course-formats should consider the integration of VR technique into the classic CPR training or vice versa, to use the advantage of both teaching techniques.",2021,1-Feb,"Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",29(1),,27,634171380,,,#2294,Issleib 2021,,
A new option for education during surgical procedures and related clinical anatomy in a virtual reality workspace,"Iwanaga, J.; Kamura, Y.; Nishimura, Y.; Terada, S.; Kishimoto, N.; Tanaka, T.; Tubbs, R. S.","The COVID-19 pandemic and mandatory social distancing has brought challenges to anatomy educators who generally need in-person classes. The purpose of this study is to share the experience of a distant online lecture on a surgical procedure and related anatomy in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) workspace and to compare it with reported teaching methods, that is, an in-person class and a Zoom online class. The lecture was delivered by three authors of this article in a VR workspace that enables people to meet through VR. The lectures were about combinations of dental surgical procedures and related clinical anatomy. Physically, the attendees could have been located anywhere in the world, so lecturers joined from the United States and the attendees were all from Japan. VR environment and its flexibility enabled attendees to join the lecture actively, helping them to gain understanding of the surgical procedure and anatomy more efficiently. The use of VR technology with a live communication tool demonstrated in this study has several advantages over previous education methods, although there are still technical issues or disadvantages that need to be addressed. Development of the technology and app/software is required so that more data can be processed at higher speed. Use of VR technology with a live communication tool could be an alternative teaching method. Its overall advantages are a closer look at the slides/monitor and concurrent observation of the multiple assets in various directions by multiple attendees. These advantages cannot be achieved by any other teaching method without VR assets with the workspace provided by Spatial. Even during the mandatory social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this could enable us to foster 3D understanding of surgery and related anatomy. Further study is now needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this newly proposed teaching method by comparing it with traditional in-person and online classes with a live communication tool.

Practicing Procedural Skills Is More Effective Than Basic Psychomotor Training in Knee Arthroscopy: A Randomized Study,"Jacobsen, M. E.; Gustafsson, A.; Jorgensen, P. G.; Park, Y. S.; Konge, L.","Background: Simulator-assisted arthroscopy education traditionally consists of initial training of basic psychomotor skills before advancing to more complex procedural tasks. Purpose(s): To explore and compare the effects of basic psychomotor skills training versus procedural skills training on novice surgeons' subsequent simulated knee arthroscopy performance. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Method(s): Overall, 22 novice orthopaedic surgeons and 11 experienced arthroscopic surgeons participated in this study, conducted from September 2015 to January 2017. Novices received a standardized introductory lesson on knee arthroscopy before being randomized into a basic skills training group or a procedural skills training group. Each group performed 2 sessions on a computer-assisted knee arthroscopy simulator: The basic skills training group completed 1 session consisting of basic psychomotor skills modules and 1 session of procedural modules (diagnostic knee arthroscopy and meniscal resection), whereas the procedural skills training group completed 2 sessions of procedural modules. Performance of the novices was compared with that of the experienced surgeons to explore evidence of validity for the basic psychomotor training skills modules and the procedural modules. The effect of prior basic psychomotor skills training and procedural skills training was explored by comparing pre- and posttraining performances of the randomized groups using a mixed-effects regression model. Result(s): Validity evidence was found for the procedural modules, as test results were reliable and experienced surgeons significantly outperformed novices. We found no evidence of validity for the basic psychomotor skills modules, as test scores were unreliable and there was no difference in performance between the experienced surgeons and novices. We found no statistical effect of basic psychomotor skills training as compared with no training (P =.49). We found a statistically significant effect of prior procedural skills training (P <.001) and a significantly larger effect of procedural skills training as compared with basic psychomotor skills training (P =.019). Conclusion(s): Procedural skills training was significantly more effective than basic psychomotor skills training regarding improved performance in diagnostic knee arthroscopy and meniscal resection on a knee arthroscopy simulator. Furthermore, the basic psychomotor skills modules lacked validity evidence. Clinical Relevance: On the basis of these results, we suggest that future competency-based curricula focus their training on full knee arthroscopy procedures. This could improve future education programs. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,9,2,,2010594789,,,#2312,Jacobsen 2021,,
Using Immersive Virtual Reality Simulation to Ensure Competence in Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound,"Jacobsen, N.; Larsen, J. D.; Falster, C.; Nolsoe, C. P.; Konge, L.; Graumann, O.; Laursen, C. B.","Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is used in various medical specialties as a diagnostic imaging tool and for procedural guidance. Experience in the procedure is currently attained via supervised clinical practice that is challenged by patient availability and risks. Prior simulation-based training and subsequent assessment could improve and ensure competence before performance on patients, but no simulator currently exists. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is a new promising simulation tool that can replicate complex interactions and environments that are unfeasible to achieve by traditional simulators. This study was aimed at developing an IVR simulation-based test for core CEUS competencies and gathering validity evidence for the test in accordance with Messick's framework. The test was developed by IVR software specialists and clinical experts in CEUS and medical education and imitated a CEUS examination of a patient with a focal liver lesion with emphasis on the pre-contrast preparations. Twenty-five medical doctors with varying CEUS experience were recruited as test participants, and their results were used to analyze test quality and to establish a pass/fail standard. The final test of 23 test items had good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85) and discriminatory abilities. The risks of false positives and negatives (9.1% and 23.6%, respectively) were acceptable for the test to be used as a certification tool prior to supervised clinical training in CEUS.

Chest compressions quality during sudden cardiac arrest scenario performed in virtual reality: A crossover study in a training environment,"Jaskiewicz, F.; Kowalewski, D.; Starosta, K.; Cierniak, M.; Timler, D.","Potential attributes of virtual reality (VR) can be a breakthrough in the improvement of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) training. However, interference with the virtual world is associated with the need of placing additional equipment on the trainee's body. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate if it does not affect the quality of chest compressions (CCs).91 voluntarily included in the study medical students participated twice in the scenario of SCA - Traditional Scenario (TS) and Virtual Reality Scenario (VRS). In both cases two minutes of resuscitation was performed.If VRS was the first scenario there were significant differences in CCs depth (VRS - Me = 47 mm [IQR 43 - 52] vs TS - Me = 48 mm [IQR 43 - 55]; P = .02) and chest relaxation (VRS - Me = 37% [IQR 5 - 91] vs TS - Me = 97% [IQR 87 - 100]; P < .001). 97.8% of respondents believe that training with the use of VR is more effective than a traditional method (P < .01). Most of the study group (91%, P < .01) denied any negative symptoms during the VR scenario.Virtual reality can be a safe and highly valued by medical students, method of hands-on CPR training. However additional VR equipment placed on the trainee's body may cause chest compressions harder to provide. If it is not preceded by traditional training, the use of VR may have an adverse impact on depth and full chest relaxation during the training. To make the best use of all the potential that virtual reality offers, future studies should focus on finding the most effective way to combine VR with traditional skill training in CPR courses curriculum.",2020,25-Nov,Medicine,99(48),,e23374,633528736,,,#2337,Jaskiewicz 2020,,
EyeSi Surgical Simulator: validation of a proficiency-based test for assessment of vitreoretinal surgical skills,"Jaud, C.; Salleron, J.; Cisse, C.; Angioi-Duprez, K.; Berrod, J. P.; Conart, J. B.","Purpose: To develop and investigate an evidence-based performance test for assessment of vitreoretinal surgical skills on the EyeSi Surgical Simulator. Method(s): Ten junior residents without any surgical experience, eight senior residents with prior experience in cataract surgery and five vitreoretinal surgeons were included in the study. The test consisted of seven modules and was completed twice by all groups during a single session. Validity evidence was evaluated using Messick's validity framework. Senior residents completed four additional test sessions and were retested 3 months after to assess skill acquisition and retention. Result(s): Content was aligned with vitreoretinal surgical skills as evaluated by expert surgeons. Response process was ensured through standardized instruction and data collection. The test showed satisfactory internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha = 0.76 (internal structure) and significant discriminative ability between the residents and the experienced surgeons (relation to other variables). A pass/fail level was determined at 596 using the contrasting groups' method. Consequences of applying this standard resulted in no false positive and no false negative. Senior residents significantly improved their simulator skills over time, reaching a plateau at the fifth iteration and equalling expert performance (p = 0.420). This level of competency was retained during the post-3-month retention testing (p = 0.062). Conclusion(s): We established a performance test with solid evidence for assessment of vitreoretinal surgical skills on the EyeSi Simulator and determined a benchmark criterion that may be used for future implementation of proficiency-based training for novices.

Role of virtual training lab in enhancing laparoscopic skills of residents versus consultants,"Javid, M. S.; Murad, F.; Ali, Q.; Nawaz, T.; Zia, N.; Malik, A. Z.; Ronald, M. C.","Objective: To compare the role of virtual training lab in enhancing laparoscopic skills at training stage and at the level of qualified surgeons. Material(s) and Method(s): In this comparative study, we included 70 participants of national and resident MIS workshops were included, 35 consultants and 35 residents were included. Participants were analyzed in the basic laparoscopic skills of instrument navigation on Lapsim. Data were collected on first day and on last day of workshop. Parameters included were left instrument time, right instrument time, tissue damage and maximum damage. Result(s): In 35 residents the left instrument time was improved mean of 27.99(Range 39.52-13.43) to 21.53 (Range 42.37-12.38) and right instrument time improved mean of 31.73(Range 52-48.19) to 23.365 (Range 48.19-11.46). The tissue damage decreased from mean of 3.2 to mean of 1.46. The maximum damage decreased from mean of 8.82 to mean of 3.408. Data of consultants showed that the left instrument time improved mean of 35.71 (Range 140.22-13.09) to 24.39 (Range 111.82-9.71) and right instrument time improved mean of 45.76 (Range 141.45-15.89) to 27.82 (Range 49.2-8.6). The tissue damage decreases from mean of 5.171 to mean of 2.228. The maximum damage decrease from mean of 13.67 to mean of 5.136. All the values at consultant level were greater than resident level. Conclusion(s): This study further confirmed that virtual lab has very important role in improving laparoscopic skills and in addition this study prove that enhancing of the laparoscopic skill at resident level is much better than the acquisition of laparoscopic skill at consultant level.

Simulation-based point-of-care ultrasound training: a matter of competency rather than volume,"Jensen, J. K.; Dyre, L.; Jorgensen, M. E.; Andreasen, L. A.; Tolsgaard, M. G.","Background: Point-of-care ultrasonography plays an increasingly important role in the initial resuscitation of critically ill patients but acquisition of the skill is associated with long learning curves. The skills required to perform ultrasound examinations can be practiced in a simulated setting before being performed on actual patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the learning curves for novices training the FAST protocol on a virtual-reality simulator. Method(s): Ultrasound novices (N = 25) were instructed to complete a FAST training program on a virtual-reality ultrasound simulator. Participants were instructed to continue training until they reached a previously established mastery learning level, which corresponds to the performance level of a group of ultrasound experts. Performance scores and time used during each FAST examination were used to determine participants' learning curves. Result(s): The participants attained the mastery learning level within a median of three (range two to four) attempts corresponding to a median of 1 h 46 min (range 1 h 2 min to 3 h 37 min) of simulation training. The ultrasound novices' examination speed improved significantly with training, and continued to improve even after they attained the mastery learning level (P = 0.011). Twenty-three participants attained the mastery learning level. Conclusion(s): Novices can attain mastery learning levels using simulation-based ultrasound training with less than, on average, 2 h of practice. However, we found large variations in the amount of training needed, which raises questions about the adequacy of current volume-based models for determining ultrasound competency.

The study objective was to establish validity evidence for a virtual reality simulator test of a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy of a right upper lobe. Method(s): Participants with varying experience in VATS lobectomy were included. They were familiarized with a virtual reality simulator (LapSim<sup></sup>) and introduced to the steps of the procedure for a VATS right upper lobe lobectomy. The participants performed two VATS lobectomies on the simulator with a 5-min break between attempts. Nineteen pre-defined simulator metrics were recorded. Result(s): Fifty-three participants from nine different countries were included. High internal consistency was found for the metrics with Cronbach's alpha coefficient for standardized items of 0.91. Significant test-retest reliability was found for 15 of the metrics (p-values <0.05). Significant correlations between the metrics and the participants VATS lobectomy experience were identified for seven metrics (p-values <0.001), and 10 metrics showed significant differences between novices (0 VATS lobectomies performed) and experienced surgeons (>50 VATS lobectomies performed). A pass/fail level defined as approximately one standard deviation from the mean metric scores for experienced surgeons passed none of the novices (0 % false positives) and failed four of the experienced surgeons (29 % false negatives). Conclusion(s): This study is the first to establish validity evidence for a VATS right upper lobe lobectomy virtual reality simulator test. Several simulator metrics demonstrated significant differences between novices and experienced surgeons and pass/fail criteria for the test were set with acceptable consequences. This test can be used as a first step in assessing thoracic surgery trainees' VATS lobectomy competency.

H.; Neckelmann, K.; Vad, H.; Moller, L. B.; Pedersen, J. H.; Konge, L.","Background: Competency-based training has gained ground in surgical training and with it assessment tools to ensure that training objectives are met. Very few assessment tools are available for evaluating performance in thoracoscopic procedures. Video recordings would provide the possibility of blinded assessment and limited rater bias. This study aimed to provide validity evidence for a newly developed and dedicated tool for assessing competency in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Method(s): Participants with varying experience with VATS lobectomy were included from different countries. Video recordings from participants' performance of a VATS right upper lobe lobectomy on a virtual reality simulator were rated by three raters using a modified version of a newly developed VATS lobectomy assessment tool (the VATSAT) and analyzed in relation to the unitary framework (content, response process, internal structure, relation to other variables, and consequences of testing). Result(s): Fifty-three participants performed two consecutive simulated VATS lobectomies on the virtual reality simulator, leaving a total of 106 videos. Content established in previously published studies. Response process Standardized data collection was ensured by using an instructional element, uniform data collection, a special rating program, and automatic generation of the results to a database. Raters were carefully instructed in using the VATSAT, and tryout ratings were carried out. Internal structure Inter-rater reliability was calculated as intra-class correlation coefficients, to 0.91 for average measures (p < 0.001). Test/re-test reliability was calculated as Pearson's r of 0.70 (p < 0.001). G-coefficient was calculated to be 0.79 with two procedures and three raters. By performing D-theory was found that either three procedures rated by two raters or five procedures rated by one rater were enough to reach an acceptable G-coefficient of >= 0.8. Relation to other variables Significant differences between groups were found (p < 0.001). The participants' VATS lobectomy experience correlated significantly to their VATSAT score (p = 0.016). Consequences of testing The pass/fail score was found to be 14.9 points by the contrasting groups' method, leaving five false positive (29%) and six false negatives (43%). Conclusion(s): Validity evidence was provided for the VATSAT according to the unitary framework. The VATSAT provides supervisors and assessors with a procedure-specific assessment tool for evaluating VATS lobectomy performance and aids with the decision of when the trainee is ready for unsupervised performance.

Virtual reality training in coronary angiography and its transfer effect to real-life catheterisation lab,"Jensen, U. J.; Jensen, J.; Ahlberg, G.; Tornvall, P.","Aims: The aim of this study was to explore if proficiency-based training in a coronary angiography (CA) simulator can transfer acquired skills from virtual reality (VR) to the real world in order to improve early performance. Methods and Results: Sixteen senior cardiology residents were randomised to proficiency-based VR training or control. Two consecutive CAs were performed on patients. Skills metrics and errors were compared between the groups. Thirty-two CAs were performed under the supervision of an experienced interventionalist. VR-trained residents practised for a mean of 10 hours in a CA simulator. In real life, the VR-trained group had shorter fluoroscopy and total procedure times than the controls (median 558 vs. 842 seconds, p=0.003 and 1,356 vs. 1,623 seconds, p=0.032, respectively). The controls had a higher error score (median 27 vs. 15, p=0.002) and a lower performance score (median 47 vs. 68, p=0.006) than the VR-trained residents. Conclusion(s): Simulator-based training in CA improved skills and decreased errors compared to mentor-based training only. CA training in VR resulted in a superior performance, measured by fluoroscopy and total procedure times, and superior error and performance scores, thereby confirming transfer validity. Our recommendation is to incorporate VR training in the curriculum for the general cardiologist to improve safe learning in CA. Copyright © Europa Digital & Publishing 2016.

Correlation Between Arthroscopy Simulator and Video Game Performance: A Cross-Sectional Study of 30 Volunteers Comparing 2- and 3-Dimensional Video Games,"Jentzsch, T.; Rahm, S.; Seifert, B.; Farei-Campagna, J.; Werner, C. M. L.; Bouaicha, S.","Purpose To investigate the association between arthroscopy simulator performance and video game skills. Methods This study compared the performances of 30 volunteers without experience performing arthroscopies in 3 different tasks of a validated virtual reality knee arthroscopy simulator with the video game experience using a questionnaire and actual performances in 5 different 2- and 3-dimensional (D) video games of varying genres on 2 different platforms. Results Positive correlations between knee arthroscopy simulator and video game performances (rho = 0.63, P <.001) as well as experiences (rho = 0.50, P =.005) were found. The strongest correlations were found for the task of catching (hooking) 6 foreign bodies (virtual rings; ""triangulation"") and the dribbling performance in a sports game and a first-person shooter game, as well as the meniscus resection and a tile-matching puzzle game (all rho >= 0.60, P <.001). No correlations were found for any of the knee arthroscopy simulator tasks and a strategy game. Conclusions Although knee arthroscopy performances do not correlate with 2-D strategy video game skills, they show a correlation with 2-D tile-matching puzzle games only for easier tasks with a rather limited focus, and highly correlate with 3-D sports and first-person shooter video games. These findings show that experienced and good 3-D gamers are better arthroscopists than nonexperienced and poor 3-D gamers. Level of Evidence Level II, observational cross-sectional study.

METHOD(S): Forty-six anesthesia residents with no experience in fiberoptic intubation were divided into two groups: VRS (group VRS) and mannequin (group M). After a standard didactic teaching session, group VRS trained 25 times on VRS, whereas group M performed the same process on a mannequin. After training, participants' performance was assessed on a mannequin five consecutive times. Procedure times during training were recorded as pooled data to construct learning curves. Procedure time and global rating scale scores of manipulation ability were compared between groups, as well as changes in participants' confidence after training. RESULT(S): Plateaus in the learning curves were achieved after 19 (95% confidence interval = 15-26) practice sessions in group VRS and 24 (95% confidence interval = 20-32) in group M. There was no significant difference in procedure time [13.7 (6.6) vs. 11.9 (4.1) seconds, t' = 1.101, P = 0.278] or global rating scale [3.9 (0.4) vs. 3.8 (0.4), t = 0.791, P = 0.433] between groups.

Simulator training and residents' first laparoscopic hysterectomy: a randomized controlled trial,"Jokinen, E.; Mikkola, T. S.; Harkki, P.","Background: Hysterectomy rates are decreasing in many countries, and virtual reality simulators bring new opportunities into residents' surgical education. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of training in laparoscopic hysterectomy module with virtual reality simulator on surgical outcomes among residents performing their first laparoscopic hysterectomy. Method(s): This randomized study was carried out at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Helsinki University Hospital and Hyvinkaa Hospital. We recruited twenty residents and randomly signed half of them to train ten times with the laparoscopic hysterectomy module on a virtual reality simulator, while the rest represented the control group. Their first laparoscopic hysterectomy was video recorded and assessed later by using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) forms and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The scores and surgical outcomes were compared between the groups. Result(s): The mean OSATS score for the Global Rating Scale (GRS) was 17.0 (SD 3.1) in the intervention group and 11.2 (SD 2.4) in the control group (p = 0.002). The mean procedure-specific OSATS score was 20.0 (SD 3.3) and 16.0 (SD 2.8) (p = 0.012), and the mean VAS score was 55.0 (SD 14.8) and 29.9 (SD 14.9) (p = 0.001). Operative time was 144 min in the intervention group and 165 min in the control group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.205). There were no differences between the groups in blood loss or direct complications. Conclusion(s): Residents training with a virtual reality simulator prior to the first laparoscopic hysterectomy seem to perform better in the actual live operation. Thus, a virtual reality simulator hysterectomy module could be considered as a part of laparoscopic training curriculum.

Simulator training in interventional cardiology,"Joshi, A.; Wragg, A.","Simulator training in interventional cardiology is becoming a central part of early career acquisition of technical and non-technical skills. Its use is now mandated by national training organisations. Haptic simulators, part-task trainers, immersive environments and simulated patients can provide benchmarked, reproducible and safe opportunities for trainees to develop without exposing patients to the learning curve. However, whilst enthusiasm persists and trainee-centred evidence has been encouraging, simulation does not yet have a clear link to improved clinical outcomes. In this article we describe the range of simulation options, review the evidence for their efficacy in training and discuss the delivery of training in technical skills as well as human factor training and crisis resource management.

A comparative analysis and guide to virtual reality robotic surgical simulators,"Julian, D.; Tanaka, A.; Mattingly, P.; Truong, M.; Perez, M.; Smith, R.","Background: Since the US Food and Drug Administration approved robotically assisted surgical devices for human surgery in 2000, the number of surgeries utilizing this innovative technology has risen. In 2015, approximately 650 000 robot-assisted procedures were performed worldwide. Surgeons must be properly trained to safely transition to using such innovative technology. Multiple virtual reality robotic simulators are now commercially available for educational and training purposes. There is a need for comparative evaluations of these simulators to aid users in selecting an appropriate device for their purposes. Method(s): We conducted a comparison of the design and capabilities of all dedicated simulators of the da Vinci robot - the da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS), dV-Trainer (dVT), Robotic Skills Simulators (RoSS) and the RobotiX Mentor. This paper provides the base specifications of the hardware and software, with an emphasis on the training capabilities of each system. Result(s): Each simulator contains a large number of training exercises for skills development: dVSS n = 40, dVT n = 65, RoSS n = 52, RobotiX Mentor n = 31. All four offer 3D visual images but use different display technologies. The dVSS leverages the real robotic surgical console to provide visualization, hand controls and foot pedals. The dVT, RoSS and RobotiX Mentor created simulated versions of all of these control systems. Each includes systems management services that allow instructors to collect, export and analyze the scores of students using the simulators. Conclusion(s): This study provides comparative information on the four simulators' functional capabilities. Each device offers unique advantages and capabilities for training robotic surgeons. Each has been the subject of validation experiments, which have been published in the literature. But those do not provide specific details on the capabilities of the simulators, which are necessary for an understanding sufficient to select the one best suited for an organization's needs. This article provides comparative information to assist with that type of selection.

The Effectiveness of Learning to Use HMD-Based VR Technologies on Nursing Students: Chemoport Insertion Surgery,"Jung, A. R.; Park, E. A.","Background: The purpose of this study was to develop a mobile head mounted display (HMD)-based virtual reality (VR) nursing education program (VRP), and to evaluate the effects on knowledge, learning attitude, satisfaction with self-practice, and learning motivation in nursing students. Method(s): This was a quasi-experimental study using a nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design to evaluate the effects of HMD-based VRP on nursing students. A Chemo-port insertion surgery nursing scenario was developed with HMD-based VRP. The experimental group consisting of 30 nursing students underwent pre-debriefing, followed by VRP using HMD and debriefing. The control group, consisting of 30 nursing students, underwent pre-debriefing, followed by self-learning using handouts about Chemoport insertion surgery procedures for 30 min, and debriefing. Result(s): The experimental group that underwent HMD-based VRP showed significantly improved post-intervention knowledge on operating nursing (p = 0.001), learning attitude (p = 0.002), and satisfaction (p = 0.017) compared to the control group. Sub-domains of motivation, attention (p < 0.05), and relevance (p < 0.05) were significantly different between the two groups, post-intervention. Conclusion(s): HMD-based VRP of Chemoport insertion surgery is expected to contribute to knowledge, learning attitude, satisfaction, attention, and relevance in nursing students.

Comparison of learning effects of virtual reality simulation on nursing students caring for children with asthma,"Kang, K. A.; Kim, S. J.; Lee, M. N.; Kim, M.; Kim, S.","With the global pandemic of the coronavirus disease, virtual reality simulation (vSim) has emerged as a simulation educational method. The purpose of this study is to examine the learning effects of vSim by comparing three different educational modalities of nursing care for children with asthma. A quasi-experimental design with three different teaching methods, vSim, high-fidelity simulation (HFS), and vSim with HFS, were used in the study. The group using vSim with HFS showed the highest scores in knowledge, confidence in practice, and performance compared to groups using vSim or HFS alone. Simulation practice using vSim combined with HFS could be an effective educational method for nursing students. Copyright © 2020, MDPI AG.

Mixed reality-based online interprofessional education: a case study in South Korea,"Kang, Y. J.; Kang, Y.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore undergraduate medical and nursing students' satisfaction with their mixed reality (MR)-based online interprofessional learning experience in South Korea. METHOD(S): This study used a case study design. A convenience sample of 30 participants (i.e., 15 third-year medical students and 15 fourth-year nursing students) participated in a 120-minute MR-based online interprofessional education (IPE) that consisted of visualization of holographic standardized patient with ischemic stroke, online interprofessional activity, and debriefing and reflection sessions. Following the MR-based online IPE, data were collected through Modified Satisfaction with Simulation Experience Scale survey and were analyzed using descriptive analyses and independent t-tests. RESULT(S): Although medical and nursing students were highly satisfied with MR-based online interprofessional learning experience, nursing students were significantly more satisfied with it compared with medical students. CONCLUSION(S): These results suggest that the integration of MR and online approach through the structured clinical reasoning process in undergraduate health professions programs can be used as an educational strategy to improve clinical reasoning and critical thinking and to promote interprofessional understanding.",2022,1-Mar,Korean journal of medical education,34(1),,63-69,637447370,,,#2474,Kang 2022,,
"The Effects of Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality as Training Enhancement Methods: A Meta-Analysis","Kaplan, A. D.; Cruit, J.; Endsley, M.; Beers, S. M.; Sawyer, B. D.; Hancock, P. A.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis is to explore the presently available, empirical findings on transfer of training from virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed reality (MR) and determine whether such extended reality (XR)-based training is as effective as traditional training methods. BACKGROUND: MR, VR, and AR have already been used as training tools in a variety of domains. However, the question of whether or not these manipulations are effective for training has not been quantitatively and conclusively answered. Evidence shows that, while extended realities can often be time-saving and cost-saving training mechanisms, their efficacy as training tools has been debated. METHOD(S): The current body of literature was examined and all qualifying articles pertaining to transfer of training from MR, VR, and AR were included in the meta-analysis. Effect sizes were calculated to determine the effects that XR-based factors, trainee-based factors, and task-based factors had on performance measures after XR-based training. RESULT(S): Results showed that training in XR does not express a different outcome than training in a nonsimulated, control environment. It is equally effective at enhancing performance. CONCLUSION(S): Across numerous studies in multiple fields, extended realities are as effective of a training mechanism as the commonly accepted methods. The value of XR then lies in providing training in circumstances, which exclude traditional methods, such as situations when danger or cost may make traditional training impossible.",2021,1-Jun,Human factors,63(4),,706-726,631068907,,,#2478,Kaplan 2021,,

Utilization of a Voice-Based Virtual Reality Advanced Cardiac Life Support Team Leader Refresher: Prospective Observational Study,"Katz, D.; Shah, R.; Kim, E.; Park, C.; Shah, A.; Levine, A.; Burnett, G.","BACKGROUND: The incidence of cardiac arrests per year in the United States continues to increase, yet in-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates significantly vary between hospitals. Current methods of training are expensive, time consuming, and difficult to scale, which necessitates improvements in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) training. Virtual reality (VR) has been proposed as an alternative or adjunct to high-fidelity simulation (HFS) in several environments. No evaluations to date have explored the ability of a VR program to examine both technical and behavioral skills and demonstrate a cost comparison. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to explore the utility of a voice-based VR ACLS team leader refresher as compared with HFS. METHOD(S): This prospective observational study performed at an academic institution consisted of 25 postgraduate year 2 residents. Participants were randomized to HFS or VR training and then crossed groups after a 2-week washout. Participants were graded on technical and nontechnical skills. Participants also completed self-assessments about the modules. Proctors were assessed for fatigue and task saturation, and cost analysis based on local economic data was performed. RESULT(S): A total of 23 of 25 participants were included in the scoring analysis. Fewer participants were familiar with VR compared with HFS (9/25, 36% vs 25/25, 100%; P<.001). Self-reported satisfaction and utilization scores were similar; however, significantly more participants felt HFS provided better feedback: 99 (IQR 89-100) vs 79 (IQR 71-88); P<.001. Technical scores were higher in the HFS group; however, nontechnical scores for decision making and communication were not significantly different between modalities. VR sessions were 21 (IQR 19-24) min shorter than HFS sessions, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index scores for proctors were lower in each category, and VR sessions were estimated to be US $103.68 less expensive in a single-learner, single-session model. CONCLUSION(S): Utilization of a VR-based team leader refresher for ACLS skills is comparable with HFS in several areas, including learner satisfaction. The VR module was more cost-effective and was easier to proctor; however, HFS was better at delivering feedback to participants. Optimal education strategies likely contain elements of both modalities. Further studies are needed to examine the utility of VR-based environments at scale.

Communication Skills Assessment Using Human Avatars: Piloting a Virtual World Objective Structured Clinical Examination,"Kava, B. R.; Andrade, A. D.; Marcovich, R.; Idress, T.; Ruiz, J. G.","Introduction Proficiency in communication skills is a core competency of residency training. We evaluated the feasibility, acceptability and applicability of a virtual world objective structured clinical examination that enables practice based learning and assessment of resident communication skills. Methods A virtual clinical encounter situated in 2 practice settings was developed that uses a human avatar physician and a standardized patient. Following an online tutorial house staff participated in 4 communication tasks, including shared decision making, delivering bad news, obtaining informed consent and disclosing a medical error. Validated instruments and semistructured interviews were used to assess house staff acceptability and applicability of the platform. Three faculty members used ACS (Affective Competency Scale) and communication specific assessment instruments to evaluate house staff performance. Results A total of 12 urology house staff completed the simulation. Direct costs were approximately $1,000. The virtual world was easy to use and immersive. Applicability directly correlated with presence (Pearson r = 0.67, p = 0.01) and co-presence (Pearson r = 0.8, p = 0.002). House staff identified problems with 1) limited nonverbal cues, 2) too much information presented and 3) a lack of immediate feedback. The ICC (intraclass correlation) of faculty assessments was high for ACS at 0.53 (95% CI 0.36-0.69) for single measures, 0.77 (95% CI 0.63-0.86) for average measures and less for other assessment instruments. Conclusions A virtual world objective structured clinical examination is a feasible, acceptable and applicable method of communication skills assessment. Improving nonverbal cues, focusing on individual skill sets and providing immediate feedback are measures to be adopted in future iterations of this platform.

Virtual Reality Warm-up Before Robot-assisted Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Kelly, J. D.; Kowalewski, T. M.; Brand, T.; French, A.; Nash, M.; Meryman, L.; Heller, N.; Organ, N.; George, E.; Smith, R.; Sorensen, M. D.; Comstock, B.; Lendvay, T. S.","Trial design: This was a randomized controlled trial. Background(s): Intraoperative errors correlate with surgeon skill and skill declines with intervals of inactivity. The goals of this research were to identify the optimal virtual reality (VR) warm-up curriculum to prime a surgeon's technical skill and validate benefit in the operating room. Material(s) and Method(s): Surgeons were randomized to receive six trial sessions of a designated set of VR modules on the da Vinci Skills Simulator to identify optimal VR warm-up curricula to prime technical skill. After performing their curricula, warm-up effect was assessed based on performance on a criterion task. The optimal warm-up curriculum was chosen from the group with the best task time and video review-based technical skill. Robot-assisted surgery-experienced surgeons were then recruited to either receive or not receive warm-up before surgery. Skill in the first 15 min of surgery was assessed by blinded surgeon and crowdworker review as well as tool motion metrics. The intervention was performing VR warm-up before human robot-assisted surgery. Warm-up effect was measured using objective performance metrics and video review using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills tool. Linear mixed effects models with a random intercept for each surgeon and nonparametric modified Friedman tests were used for analysis. Result(s): The group performing only a Running Suture task on the simulator was on average 31.3 s faster than groups performing other simulation tasks and had the highest Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills scores from 41 surgeons who participated. This was chosen as the optimal curriculum. Thereafter, 34 surgeons completed 347 surgeries with corresponding video and tool motion data. No statistically significant differences in skill were observed with the warm-up intervention. Conclusion(s): We conclude that a robotic VR warm-up before performing the early stages of surgery does not impact the technical skill of the surgeon.

Speed versus damage: using selective feedback to modulate laparoscopic simulator performance,"Kengen, B.; I. Jgosse W.M; van Goor, H.; Luursema, J. M.","BACKGROUND: Adaptive training is an approach in which training variables change with the needs and traits of individual trainees. It has potential to mitigate the effect of personality traits such as impulsiveness on surgical performance. Selective performance feedback is one way to implement adaptive training. This paper investigates whether selective feedback can direct performance of trainees of either high- or low impulsiveness. METHOD(S): A total of 83 inexperienced medical students of known impulsiveness performed a four-session laparoscopic training course on a Virtual Reality Simulator. They performed two identical series of tasks every session. During one series of tasks they received performance feedback on duration and during the other series they received feedback on damage. Performance parameters (duration and damage) were compared between the two series of tasks to assess whether selective performance feedback can be used to steer emphasis in performance. To assess the effectiveness of selective feedback for people of high- or low impulsiveness, the difference in performance between the two series for both duration and damage was also assessed. RESULT(S): Participants were faster when given performance feedback for speed for all exercises in all sessions (average z-value=-4.14, all p values < .05). Also, they performed better on damage control when given performance feedback for damage in all tasks and during all sessions except for one (average z-value=-4.19, all but one p value < .05). Impulsiveness did not impact the effectiveness of selective feedback. CONCLUSION(S): Selective feedback on either duration or damage can be used to improve performance for the variable that the trainee receives feedback on. Trainee impulsiveness did not modulate this effect. Selective feedback can be used to steer training focus in adaptive training systems and can mitigate the negative effects of impulsiveness on damage control.",2021,29-Jun,BMC medical education,21(1),,361,635493806,,,#2536,Kengen 2021,,
"IMHOTEP: cross-professional evaluation of a three-dimensional virtual reality system for interactive surgical operation planning, tumor board discussion and immersive training for complex liver surgery in a head-mounted display","Kenngott, H. G.; Pfeiffer, M.; Preukschas, A. A.; Bettscheider, L.; Wise, P. A.; Wagner, M.; Speidel, S.; Huber, M.; Nickel, F.; Mehrabi, A.; Muller-Stich, B. P.","Background: Virtual reality (VR) with head-mounted displays (HMD) may improve medical training and patient care by improving display and integration of different types of information. The aim of this study was to evaluate among different healthcare professions the potential of an interactive and immersive VR environment for liver surgery that integrates all relevant patient data from different sources needed for planning and training of procedures. Method(s): 3D-models of the liver, other abdominal organs, vessels, and tumors of a sample patient with multiple hepatic masses were created. 3D-models, clinical patient data, and other imaging data were visualized in a dedicated VR environment with an HMD (IMHOTEP). Users could interact with the data using head movements and a computer mouse. Structures of interest could be selected and viewed individually or grouped. IMHOTEP was evaluated in the context of preoperative planning and training of liver surgery and for the potential of broader surgical application. A standardized questionnaire was voluntarily answered by four groups (students, nurses, resident and attending surgeons). Result(s): In the evaluation by 158 participants (57 medical students, 35 resident surgeons, 13 attending surgeons and 53 nurses), 89.9% found the VR system agreeable to work with. Participants generally agreed that complex cases in particular could be assessed better (94.3%) and faster (84.8%) with VR than with traditional 2D display methods. The highest potential was seen in student training (87.3%), resident training (84.6%), and clinical routine use (80.3%). Least potential was seen in nursing training (54.8%). Conclusion(s): The present study demonstrates that using VR with HMD to integrate all available patient data for the preoperative planning of hepatic resections is a viable concept. VR with HMD promises great potential to improve medical training and operation planning and thereby to achieve improvement in patient care.

Virtual reality simulation training for health professions trainees in gastrointestinal endoscopy,"Khan, R.; Plahouras, J.; Johnston, B. C.; Scaffidi, M. A.; Grover, S. C.; Walsh, C. M.","Background: Endoscopy has traditionally been taught with novices practicing on real patients under the supervision of experienced endoscopists. Recently, the growing awareness of the need for patient safety has brought simulation training to the forefront. Simulation training can provide trainees with the chance to practice their skills in a learner-centred, risk-free environment. It is important to ensure that skills gained through simulation positively transfer to the clinical environment. This updated review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) simulation training in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Objective(s): To determine whether virtual reality simulation training can supplement and/or replace early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) in diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, and/or sigmoidoscopy for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. Search Method(s): We searched the following health professions, educational, and computer databases until 12 July 2017: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, CINAHL, AMED, ERIC, Education Full Text, CBCA Education, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Abstracts in New Technology and Engineering, Computer and Information Systems Abstracts, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. We also searched the grey literature until November 2017. Selection Criteria: We included randomised and quasi-randomised clinical trials comparing VR endoscopy simulation training versus any other method of endoscopy training with outcomes measured on humans in the clinical setting, including conventional patient-based training, training using another form of endoscopy simulation, or no training. We also included trials comparing two different methods of VR training. Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of trials, and extracted data on the trial characteristics and outcomes. We pooled data for meta-analysis where participant groups were similar, studies assessed the same intervention and comparator, and had similar definitions of outcome measures. We calculated risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We calculated mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes when studies reported the same or different outcome measures, respectively. We used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence. Main Result(s): We included 18 trials (421 participants; 3817 endoscopic procedures). We judged three trials as at low risk of bias. Ten trials compared VR training with no training, five trials with conventional endoscopy training, one trial with another form of endoscopy simulation training, and two trials compared two different methods of VR training. Due to substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity across our four comparisons, we did not perform a meta-analysis for several outcomes. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, low, or very low due to risk of bias, imprecision, and heterogeneity. Virtual reality endoscopy simulation training versus no training: There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect on composite score of competency (MD 3.10, 95% CI -0.16 to 6.36; 1 trial, 24 procedures; low-quality evidence). Composite score of competency was based on 5-point Likert scales assessing seven domains: atraumatic technique, colonoscope advancement, use of instrument controls, flow of procedure, use of assistants, knowledge of specific procedure, and overall performance. Scoring range was from 7 to 35, a higher score representing a higher level of competence. Virtual reality training compared to no training likely provides participants with some benefit, as measured by independent procedure completion (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.26; 6 trials, 815 procedures; moderate-quality evidence). We evaluated overall rating of performance (MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.75; 1 trial, 18 procedures), visualisation of mucosa (MD 0.60, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.00; 1 trial, 55 procedures), performance time (MD -0.20 minutes, 95% CI -0.71 to 0.30; 2 trials, 29 procedures), and patient discomfort (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.35; 2 trials, 145 procedures), all with very low-quality evidence. No trials reported procedure-related complications or critical flaws (e.g. bleeding, luminal perforation) (3 trials, 550 procedures; moderate-quality evidence). Virtual reality endoscopy simulation training versus conventional patient-based training: One trial reported composite score of competency but did not provide sufficient data for quantitative analysis. Virtual reality training compared to conventional patient-based training resulted in fewer independent procedure completions (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.74; 2 trials, 174 procedures; low-quality evidence). We evaluated performance time (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.80; 2 trials, 34 procedures), overall rating of performance (MD -0.90, 95% CI -4.40 to 2.60; 1 trial, 16 procedures), and visualisation of mucosa (MD 0.0, 95% CI -6.02 to 6.02; 1 trial, 18 procedures), all with very low-quality evidence. Virtual reality training in combination with conventional training appears to be advantageous over VR training alone. No trials reported any procedure-related complications or critical flaws (3 trials, 72 procedures; very low-quality evidence). Virtual reality endoscopy simulation training versus another form of endoscopy simulation: Based on one study, there were no differences between groups with respect to composite score of competency, performance time, and visualisation of mucosa. Virtual reality training in combination with another form of endoscopy simulation training did not appear to confer any benefit compared to VR training alone. Two methods of virtual reality training: Based on one study, a structured VR simulation-based training curriculum compared to self regulated learning on a VR simulator appears to provide benefit with respect to a composite score evaluating competency. Based on another study, a progressive-learning curriculum that sequentially increases task difficulty provides benefit with respect to a composite score of competency over the structured VR training curriculum. Authors' conclusions: VR simulation-based training can be used to supplement early conventional endoscopy training for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. However, we found insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of VR simulation-based training s a replacement for early conventional endoscopy training. The quality of the current evidence was low due to inadequate randomisation, allocation concealment, and/or blinding of outcome assessment in several trials. Further trials are needed that are at low risk of bias, utilise outcome measures with strong evidence of validity and reliability, and examine the optimal nature and duration of training.

Validation of a Novel Cognitive Simulator for Orbital Floor Reconstruction,"Khelemsky, R.; Hill, B.; Buchbinder, D.","Purpose The increasing focus on patient safety in current medical practice has promoted the development of surgical simulation technology in the form of virtual reality (VR) training designed largely to improve technical skills and less so for nontechnical aspects of surgery such as decision making and material knowledge. The present study investigated the validity of a novel cognitive VR simulator called Touch Surgery for a core maxillofacial surgical procedure: orbital floor reconstruction (OFR). Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out on 2 groups of participants with different experience levels. Novice graduate dental students and expert surgeons were recruited from a local dental school and academic residency programs, respectively. All participants completed the OFR module on Touch Surgery. The primary outcome variable was simulator performance score. Post-module questionnaires rating specific aspects of the simulation experience were completed by the 2 groups and served as the secondary outcome variables. The age and gender of participants were considered additional predictor variables. From these data, conclusions were made regarding 3 types of validity (face, content, and construct) for the Touch Surgery simulator. Dependent-samples t tests were used to explore the consistency in simulation performance scores across phases 1 and 2 by experience level. Two multivariate ordinary least-squares regression models were fit to estimate the relation between experience and phase 1 and 2 scores. Results Thirty-nine novices and 10 experts who were naive to Touch Surgery were recruited for the study. Experts outperformed novices on phases 1 and 2 of the OFR module (P < .001), which provided the measurement of construct validation. Responses to the questionnaire items used to assess face validity were favorable from the 2 groups. Positive questionnaire responses also were recorded from experts alone on items assessing the content validity for the module. Participant age and gender were not relevant predictors of performance scores. Conclusion Construct, content, and face validities were observed for the OFR module on a novel cognitive simulator, Touch Surgery. Therefore, OFR simulation on the smart device platform could serve as a useful cognitive training and assessment tool in maxillofacial surgery residency programs.

How to teach intramuscular injection through virtual learning environment in covid-19 pandemic time for nursing students,"Khraisat, A. M. S.; Hapidin, H.; Ahmad, N. S. H. N.; Yusoff, M. D. M.; Nurumal, M. S.; Pardi, K. W.","During the pandemic COVID-19 spread and the temporary lockdown of universities, there has been a global shift toward online learning. Some universities were not prepared for such circumstances, and they began attempting to meet this unprecedented task for not missing the academic year. Recently, there has been a project that is currently working on the same issue regarding teaching nursing students how to deliver intramuscular (IM) injection using online in a virtual learning environment. The objective of this study was to create a simulation in an online course using a three-dimensional (3D) learning management system (LMS) in a virtual learning environment (VLE). That can replace IM injection traditional teaching method. This LMS intended to supplement the existing lab practice to nursing undergraduate students by creating a simulated online clinic with a nurse and patient avatars. Theoretical content in the form of reading material and related videos was also provided for students' cognitive base before they start the 3D simulation training. This new course was founded on the Galvis panqueva method that resulted in a product called Online-3D-IMI-VLE. Various validation processes undertook for multiple development processes involving nursing content specialists and computer multimedia. The pilot results showed that this LMS could replace the traditional way of teaching and support online learning during the normal education environment as well as in this COVID-19 pandemic time.

Virtual Reality Haptic Simulator for Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base Surgeries,"Kim, D. H.; Kim, H. M.; Park, J. S.; Kim, S. W.","OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes a virtual reality (VR) haptic simulator with realistic instruments, an exchangeable patient-specific three-dimensional (3D)-printed external nostril and a caudal septum model to facilitate real surgical motion for training in endoscopic sinus and skull-base surgery. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: industry-academy cooperation development model METHODS:: The VR simulator consists of the main simulator body, a monitor, an endoscope device, 2 haptic devices, an endoscope holder support fixture, and a pair of pedals. The location of the endoscope device is determined by an electromagnetic sensor. Two haptic devices are located so as to prevent mutual interference during application of the two-nostrils/four-hands technique for endoscopic skull-base surgery. The pedals were used for select surgical instrument and endoscopes, and operate microdebriders or microdrill. An exchangeable patient-specific external nostril and caudal septum model was created using material that mimics the texture of human tissue and a 3D printer. Graphics were rendered using Unity 3D, to which the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA) physics engine can be bolted on using the Unity3d plug-in. RESULT(S): This VR haptic simulator enables performance of basic endoscopic sinus surgeries (eg, maxillary sinus antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and frontostomy), as well as endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal (including sphenoidotomy) and transclival approaches. CONCLUSION(S): VR haptic simulators can improve the skill and confidence of surgical trainees by allowing them to accrue experience in various tasks under different conditions. The simulator introduced here comprises novel technologies and provides a realistic training environment for endoscopic sinus and skull-base surgery.",2020,1-Sep,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,31(6),,1811-1814,631593418,,,#2580,Kim 2020,,

Hands-Free User Interface for VR Headsets Based on In Situ Facial Gesture Sensing,"Kim, J.; Cha, J.; Kim, S.","The typical configuration of virtual reality (VR) devices consists of a head-mounted display (HMD) and handheld controllers. As such, these units have limited utility in tasks that require hand-free operation, such as in surgical operations or assembly works in cyberspace. We propose a user interface for a VR headset based on a wearer's facial gestures for hands-free interaction, similar to a touch interface. By sensing and recognizing the expressions associated with the in situ intentional movements of a user's facial muscles, we define a set of commands that combine predefined facial gestures with head movements. This is achieved by utilizing six pairs of infrared (IR) photocouplers positioned at the foam interface of an HMD. We demonstrate the usability and report on the user experience as well as the performance of the proposed command set using an experimental VR game without any additional controllers. We obtained more than 99% of recognition accuracy for each facial gesture throughout the three steps of experimental tests. The proposed input interface is a cost-effective and efficient solution that facilitates hands-free user operation of a VR headset using built-in infrared photocouplers positioned in the foam interface. The proposed system recognizes facial gestures and incorporates a hands-free user interface to HMD, which is similar to the touch-screen experience of a smartphone.",2020,,Sensors,20,24,,633847829,,,#2590,Kim 2020,"Jeffrey Jacobson (2022-10-14 10:09:18)(Screen): Not medical training.

Adaptation of extended reality smart glasses for core nursing skill training among undergraduate nursing students: Usability and feasibility study,"Kim, S. K.; Lee, Y.; Yoon, H.; Choi, J.","Background: Skill training in nursing education has been highly dependent on self-training because of Korea's high student-faculty ratio. Students tend to have a passive attitude in self-practice, and it is hard to expect effective learning outcomes with traditional checklist-dependent self-practice. Smart glasses have a high potential to assist nursing students with timely information, and a hands-free device does not interrupt performance. Objective(s): This study aimed to develop a smart glass-based nursing skill training program and evaluate its usability and feasibility for the implementation of self-practice. Method(s): We conducted a usability and feasibility study with 30 undergraduate nursing students during a 2-hour open lab for self-practice of core nursing skills, wearing smart glasses for visualized guidance. The usability test was conducted using a 16-item self-reporting questionnaire and 7 open-ended questions. Learning satisfaction was assessed using a 7-item questionnaire. The number of practice sessions was recorded, and perceived competency in core nursing skills was measured before and after the intervention. At the final evaluation, performance accuracy and time consumed for completion were recorded. Result(s): Smart glass-assisted self-practice of nursing skills was perceived as helpful, convenient, and interesting. Participants reported improved recollection of sequences of skills, and perceived competency was significantly improved. Several issues were raised by participants regarding smart glasses, including small screen size, touch sensors, fogged lenses with masks, heaviness, and heat after a period of time. Conclusion(s): Smart glasses have the potential to assist self-practice, providing timely information at students' own paces. Having both hands free from holding a device, participants reported the convenience of learning as they could practice and view the information simultaneously. Further revision correcting reported issues would improve the applicability of smart glasses in other areas of nursing education. Copyright © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Development of an objective assessment tool for total laparoscopic hysterectomy: A Delphi method among experts and evaluation on a virtual reality simulator,"Knight, S.; Aggarwal, R.; Agostini, A.; Loundou, A.; Berdah, S.; Crochet, P.","Introduction Total Laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) requires an advanced level of operative skills and training. The aim of this study was to develop an objective scale specific for the assessment of technical skills for LH (H-OSATS) and to demonstrate feasibility of use and validity in a virtual reality setting. Material and methods The scale was developed using a hierarchical task analysis and a panel of international experts. A Delphi method obtained consensus among experts on relevant steps that should be included into the H-OSATS scale for assessment of operative performances. Feasibility of use and validity of the scale were evaluated by reviewing video recordings of LH performed on a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator. Three groups of operators of different levels of experience were assessed in a Marseille teaching hospital (10 novices, 8 intermediates and 8 experienced surgeons). Correlations with scores obtained using a recognised generic global rating tool (OSATS) were calculated. Results A total of 76 discrete steps were identified by the hierarchical task analysis. 14 experts completed the two rounds of the Delphi questionnaire. 64 steps reached consensus and were integrated in the scale. During the validation process, median time to rate each video recording was 25 minutes. There was a significant difference between the novice, intermediate and experienced group for total H-OSATS scores (133, 155.9 and 178.25 respectively; p = 0.002). H-OSATS scale demonstrated high inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.930; p<0.001) and test retest reliability (ICC = 0.877; p<0.001). High correlations were found between total H-OSATS scores and OSATS scores (rho = 0.928; p<0.001). Conclusion The H-OSATS scale displayed evidence of validity for assessment of technical performances for LH performed on a virtual reality simulator. The implementation of this scale is expected to facilitate deliberate practice. Next steps should focus on evaluating the validity of the scale in the operating room. Copyright © 2018 Knight et al.

Virtual reality (VR)-based simulations offer rich opportunities for surgical skill training and assessment of surgical novices and experts. A structured evaluation and validation process of such training and assessment tools is necessary for effective surgical learning environments. Objective. To develop and apply a classification system of surgeon-reported experience during operation of a VR vertebroplasty simulator. Methods. A group of orthopedic, trauma surgeons and neurosurgeons (n = 13) with various levels of expertise performed on a VR vertebroplasty simulator. We established a mixed-methods design using think-aloud protocols, senior surgical expert evaluations, performance metrics, and a post-simulation questionnaire. Verbal content was systematically analyzed using structured qualitative content analysis. We established a category system for classification of surgeons' verbal evaluations during the simulation. Furthermore, we evaluated intraoperative performance metrics and explored potential associations with surgeons' characteristics and simulator evaluation. Results. Overall, 244 comments on realism and usability of the vertebroplasty simulator were collected. This included positive and negative remarks, questions, and specific suggestions for improvement. Further findings included surgeons' approval of the realism and usability of the simulator and the observation that the haptic feedback of the VR patient's anatomy requires further improvement. Surgeon-reported evaluations were not associated with performance decrements. Discussion. This study is the first to apply think-aloud protocols for evaluation of a surgical VR-based simulator. A novel classification approach is introduced that can be used to classify surgeons' verbalized experiences during simulator use.

Correlation of surgical trainee performance on laparoscopic versus endoscopic simulation,"Koichopolos, J.; Hawel, J.; Shlomovitz, E.; Habaz, I.; Elnahas, A.; Alkhamesi, N. A.; Schlachta, C. M.","Background: Both laparoscopy and endoscopy are image-based procedures, which are less intuitive than traditional open surgery and require extensive training to reach adequate proficiency. Currently, there is lack of understanding as to how the skills in one image-based procedure translate to another, such as endoscopy to laparoscopy and vice versa. The aim of our study was to explore the relationship between endoscopic and laparoscopic skills using a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) trainer, a traditional virtual reality endoscopic trainer and a ""desk-top"" endoscopic physical simulator. Method(s): Senior surgical residents from across Canada participating in an advanced laparoscopic foregut training course were enrolled in the study. Participants were assessed performing the FLS laparoscopic suturing task, the Endobubble 2 task (Simbionix, GI Mentor), and a forward viewing peg transfer on the novel Basics in Endoscopic Skills Training Box (BEST Box). Result(s): There was significant correlation between the participant's skill in simulated laparoscopic suturing and simulated endoscopic skill using the BEST box (Pearson coefficient (r) was 0.551 (p = 0.033) and the coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>) was 0.304). There was a trend towards correlation between laparoscopic suturing time and Endobubble 2 score, but this did not reach statistical significance (r = 0.458, p = 0.086; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.210).

Higher scores on incision/port placement on LC-SIM is associated with better tissue handling (coefficient 0.20, p = 0.048) and better time & economy of motion on STAT (coefficient 0.22, p = 0.037). However, higher scores on time and motion on OSATS are associated with worse tissue handling (- 0.28, p = 0.046), worse time & economy of motion (- 0.37, p = 0.009), and worse overall grade (- 0.21, p = 0.044). Higher scores on overall performance on OSATS is associated with worse time & economy of motion (- 0.80, p = 0.008). Higher scores on depth perception on GOALS are associated with worse tissue handling (- 0.28, p = 0.044). Conclusion(s): We found significant positive and negative associations between resident simulation performance and OR performance, particularly in tissue handling and economy of motion. This could suggest that simulation performance does not reliably predict OR performance. However, this could highlight the concept of excessive caution in the real OR environment and longer operative time which could be interpreted as worse time and economy of motion by the attending surgeons.

Subjective vs. objective assessment of simulation performance on laparoscopic cholecystectomy: are we evaluating the right things?,"Kojima, Y.; Wong, H. J.; Kuchta, K.; Linn, J. G.; Haggerty, S. P.; Denham, W.; Ujiki, M. B.","Background: Simulation using virtual reality (VR) simulators is an important tool in surgical training. VR laparoscopic simulators can provide immediate objective performance assessment without observer evaluation. This study aims to explore the correlation between subjective observer evaluation and VR laparoscopic simulator performance metrics in a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) simulation module. Method(s): A LC simulation module using a VR laparoscopic simulator was completed by PGY2-3 general surgery residents at a single institution. Simulation performance was recorded and evaluated by a trained evaluator using the validated Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) form, the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) form, and a LC-specific simulation assessment form (LC-SIM). Objective performance metrics were also obtained from the simulator system. Performance before the curriculum (pre-test) and after the curriculum (post-test) were compared. Result(s): Fourteen residents were included in the study. There were significant improvements from pre-test to post-test on each component of GOALS, OSATS, and LC-SIM scores (all p values < 0.05). In terms of objective simulator metrics, significant improvements were noted in time to extract gallbladder (481 +/- 221 vs 909 +/- 366 min, p = 0.019), total number of movements (475 +/- 264 vs 839 +/- 324 min, p = 0.012), and total path length (955 +/- 475 vs 1775 +/- 632 cm, p = 0.012) from pre-test to post-test. While number of movements and total path lengths of both hands decreased, speed of right instrument also decreased from 4.1 + 2.7 to 3.0 +/- 0.7 cm/sec (p = 0.007). Average speed of left instrument was associated with respect for tissue (r = 0.60, p < 0.05) and depth perception (r = 0.68, p < 0.05) on post-test evaluations. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated significant improvement in technical skills based on subjective evaluator assessment as well as objective simulator metrics after simulation. The few correlations identified between the subjective evaluator and the objective simulator assessments suggest the two evaluation modalities were measuring different aspects of the technical skills and should both be considered in the evaluation process.

A prototype of a handheld augmented reality application to get familiar with ultrasound equipment knobology,"Kollmann, C.; Santner, L.","Aims: A prototype application has been developed that is adapting modern augmented reality technology to support learning in ultrasound skills-labs or at home. The application enables students to get in real-time an orientation and information about the knobs on an equipment's control panel that is available in the lab. Material(s) and Method(s): The Augmented reality (AR) application for smartphones or tablets was created in Unity (San Francisco) with the software development kit Vuforia (Vuforia PTC Inc., Zurich) to support students with their own devices to learn the knobology of an ultrasound equipment. An interface was modelled, which is superimposed on the live camera image and provides information about the displayed knobs and sliders on the control panel. Result(s): The smartphone or tablet app is able to detect the specific ultrasound equipment in real in the skills-lab, as well as from a hardcopy photo or displayed by a monitor and to provide further detailed information. The application can be used therefore as preparation of a practical course or for orientation within the lab at the equipment. Conclusion(s): The flexibility of the app is optimal for students to become familiar with the equipment before they are having their skills-lab lecture and might help to reduce time for introduction to orientation at the equipment's console.

NOViSE: a virtual natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery simulator,"Korzeniowski, P.; Barrow, A.; Sodergren, M. H.; Hald, N.; Bello, F.","Purpose: Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is a novel technique in minimally invasive surgery whereby a flexible endoscope is inserted via a natural orifice to gain access to the abdominal cavity, leaving no external scars. This innovative use of flexible endoscopy creates many new challenges and is associated with a steep learning curve for clinicians. Method(s): We developed NOViSE-the first force-feedback-enabled virtual reality simulator for NOTES training supporting a flexible endoscope. The haptic device is custom-built, and the behaviour of the virtual flexible endoscope is based on an established theoretical framework-the Cosserat theory of elastic rods. Result(s): We present the application of NOViSE to the simulation of a hybrid trans-gastric cholecystectomy procedure. Preliminary results of face, content and construct validation have previously shown that NOViSE delivers the required level of realism for training of endoscopic manipulation skills specific to NOTES. Conclusion(s): VR simulation of NOTES procedures can contribute to surgical training and improve the educational experience without putting patients at risk, raising ethical issues or requiring expensive animal or cadaver facilities. In the context of an experimental technique, NOViSE could potentially facilitate NOTES development and contribute to its wider use by keeping practitioners up to date with this novel surgical technique. NOViSE is a first prototype, and the initial results indicate that it provides promising foundations for further development.

Validation of NOViSE: A novel natural orifice virtual surgery simulator,"Korzeniowski, P.; Brown, D. C.; Sodergren, M. H.; Barrow, A.; Bello, F.","The goal of this study was to establish face, content, and construct validity of NOViSE-the first force-feedback enabled virtual reality (VR) simulator for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Fourteen surgeons and surgical trainees performed 3 simulated hybrid transgastric cholecystectomies using a flexible endoscope on NOViSE. Four of them were classified as ""NOTES experts"" who had independently performed 10 or more simulated or human NOTES procedures. Seven participants were classified as ""Novices"" and 3 as ""Gastroenterologists"" with no or minimal NOTES experience. A standardized 5-point Likert-type scale questionnaire was administered to assess the face and content validity. NOViSE showed good overall face and content validity. In 14 out of 15 statements pertaining to face validity (graphical appearance, endoscope and tissue behavior, overall realism), >=50% of responses were ""agree"" or ""strongly agree."" In terms of content validity, 85.7% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that NOViSE is a useful training tool for NOTES and 71.4% that they would recommend it to others. Construct validity was established by comparing a number of performance metrics such as task completion times, path lengths, applied forces, and so on. NOViSE demonstrated early signs of construct validity. Experts were faster and used a shorter endoscopic path length than novices in all but one task. The results indicate that NOViSE authentically recreates a transgastric hybrid cholecystectomy and sets promising foundations for the further development of a VR training curriculum for NOTES without compromising patient safety or requiring expensive animal facilities.

LapTrain: multi-modality training curriculum for laparoscopic cholecystectomy-results of a randomized controlled trial,"Kowalewski, K. F.; Garrow, C. R.; Proctor, T.; Preukschas, A. A.; Friedrich, M.; Muller, P. C.; Kenngott, H. G.; Fischer, L.; Muller-Stich, B. P.; Nickel, F.","Background: Multiple training modalities for laparoscopy have different advantages, but little research has been conducted on the benefit of a training program that includes multiple different training methods compared to one method only. This study aimed to evaluate benefits of a combined multi-modality training program for surgical residents. Method(s): Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) was performed on a porcine liver as the pre-test. Randomization was stratified for experience to the multi-modality Training group (12 h of training on Virtual Reality (VR) and box trainer) or Control group (no training). The post-test consisted of a VR LC and porcine LC. Performance was rated with the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) score by blinded experts. Result(s): Training (n = 33) and Control (n = 31) were similar in the pre-test (GOALS: 13.7 +/- 3.4 vs. 14.7 +/- 2.6; p = 0.198; operation time 57.0 +/- 18.1 vs. 63.4 +/- 17.5 min; p = 0.191). In the post-test porcine LC, Training had improved GOALS scores (+ 2.84 +/- 2.85 points, p < 0.001), while Control did not (+ 0.55 +/- 2.34 points, p = 0.154). Operation time in the post-test was shorter for Training vs. Control (40.0 +/- 17.0 vs. 55.0 +/- 22.2 min; p = 0.012). Junior residents improved GOALS scores to the level of senior residents (pre-test: 13.7 +/- 2.7 vs. 18.3 +/- 2.9; p = 0.010; post-test: 15.5 +/- 3.4 vs. 18.8 +/- 3.8; p = 0.120) but senior residents remained faster (50.1 +/- 20.6 vs. 25.0 +/- 1.9 min; p < 0.001). No differences were found between groups on the post-test VR trainer. Conclusion(s): Structured multi-modality training is beneficial for novices to improve basics and overcome the initial learning curve in laparoscopy as well as to decrease operation time for LCs in different stages of experience.

Validation of the mobile serious game application Touch SurgeryTM for cognitive training and assessment of laparoscopic cholecystectomy,"Kowalewski, K. F.; Hendrie, J. D.; Schmidt, M. W.; Proctor, T.; Paul, S.; Garrow, C. R.; Kenngott, H. G.; Muller-Stich, B. P.; Nickel, F.","Background: Touch Surgery<sup>TM</sup> (TS) is a serious gaming application for cognitive task simulation and rehearsal of key steps in surgical procedures. The aim was to establish face, content, and construct validity of TS for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Furthermore, learning curves with TS and a virtual reality (VR) trainer were compared in a randomized trial. Method(s): The performance of medical students and general surgeons was compared for all three modules of LC in TS to establish construct validity. Questionnaires assessed face and content validity. For analysis of learning curves, students were randomized to train on VR or TS first, and then switched to the other training modality. Performance data were recorded. Result(s): 54 Surgeons and 51 medical students completed the validation study. Surgeons outperformed students with TS: patient preparation (students = 45.0 +/- 19.1%; surgeons = 57.3 +/- 15.2%; p < 0.001), access and laparoscopy (students = 70.2 +/- 10.9%; surgeons = 75.9 +/- 9.7%; p = 0.008) and LC (students = 69.8 +/- 12.4%; surgeons = 77.7 +/- 9.6%; p < 0.001). Both groups agreed that TS was a highly useful and realistic application. 46 students were randomized for learning curve analysis. It took them 2-4 attempts to reach a 100% score with TS. Training with TS first did not improve students' performance on the VR trainer; however, students who trained with VR first scored significantly higher in module 3 of TS. Conclusion(s): TS is an accepted serious gaming application for learning cognitive aspects of LC with established construct, face, and content validity. There appeared to be a synergy between TS and the VR trainer. Therefore, the two training modalities should accompany one another in a multimodal training approach to laparoscopy.

Benefits of gamification in medical education,"Krishnamurthy, K.; Selvaraj, N.; Gupta, P.; Cyriac, B.; Dhurairaj, P.; Abdullah, A.; Krishnapillai, A.; Lugova, H.; Haque, M.; Xie, S.; Ang, E. T.","Medical education is changing at a fast pace. Students attend medical school with a high degree of technological literacy and a desire for a diverse educational experience. As a result, a growing number of medical schools are incorporating technology-enhanced active learning and multimedia education tools into their curriculum. Gamified training platforms include educational games, mobile medical apps, and virtual patient scenarios. We provide a systematic review of what is meant by gamification in this era. Specific educational games, mobile apps, and virtual simulations that may be used for preclinical and clinical training have been discovered and classified. The available data were presented in terms of the recognized platforms for medical education's possible benefits. Virtual patient simulations have been shown to enhance learning results in general. Gamification could improve learning, engagement, and cooperation by allowing for real-world application. They may also help with promoting risk-free healthcare decision-making, remote learning, learning analytics, and quick feedback. We account for Preclinical training which included 5 electronic games and 4 mobile apps, while clinical training included 5 electronic games, 10 mobile applications, and 12 virtual patient simulation tools. There were additionally nine more gamified virtual environment training products that were not commercially accessible. Many of these studies have shown that utilizing gamified media in medical education may confer advantages.

M.","Objectives To assess advanced communication skills among second-year medical students exposed either to a computer simulation (MPathic-VR) featuring virtual humans, or to a multimedia computer-based learning module, and to understand each group's experiences and learning preferences. Methods A single-blinded, mixed methods, randomized, multisite trial compared MPathic-VR (N = 210) to computer-based learning (N = 211). Primary outcomes: communication scores during repeat interactions with MPathic-VR's intercultural and interprofessional communication scenarios and scores on a subsequent advanced communication skills objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare outcomes. Secondary Outcomes: student attitude surveys and qualitative assessments of their experiences with MPathic-VR or computer-based learning. Results MPathic-VR-trained students improved their intercultural and interprofessional communication performance between their first and second interactions with each scenario. They also achieved significantly higher composite scores on the OSCE than computer-based learning-trained students. Attitudes and experiences were more positive among students trained with MPathic-VR, who valued its providing immediate feedback, teaching nonverbal communication skills, and preparing them for emotion-charged patient encounters. Conclusions MPathic-VR was effective in training advanced communication skills and in enabling knowledge transfer into a more realistic clinical situation.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of reproducible disruptive factors on the surgeon's work. In a cross-sectional investigation, surgeons were tested with regard to the impact of different disruptive factors when doing exercises on a robotic-surgery simulator (Mimic Flex VRTM). Additionally, we collected data about the participants' professional experience, gender, age, expertise in playing an instrument, and expertise in playing video games. The data were collected during DRUS 2019 (Symposium of the German Society for Robot-assisted Urology). Forty-two surgeons attending DRUS 2019 were asked to participate in a virtual robotic stress training unit. The surgeons worked in various specialties (visceral surgery, gynecology, and urology) and had different levels of expertise. The time taken to complete the exercise (TTCE), the final score (FSC), and blood loss (BL) were measured. In the basic exercise with an interactive disruption, TTCE was significantly longer (p < 0.01) and FSC significantly lower (p < 0.05). No significant difference in TTCE, FSC, or BL was noted in the advanced exercise with acoustic disruption. Performance during disruption was not dependent on the level of surgical experience, gender, age, expertise in playing an instrument, or playing video games. A positive correlation was registered between self-estimation and surgical experience. Interactive disruptions have a greater impact on the performance of a surgeon than acoustic ones. Disruption affects the performance of experienced as well as inexperienced surgeons.

Surgeon-authored virtual laparoscopic adrenalectomy module is judged effective and preferred over traditional teaching tools,"Kurenov, S.; Cendan, J.; Dindar, S.; Attwood, K.; Hassett, J.; Nawotniak, R.; Cherr, G.; Cance, W. G.; Peters, J.","Objective. The study assesses user acceptance and effectiveness of a surgeon-authored virtual reality (VR) training module authored by surgeons using the Toolkit for Illustration of Procedures in Surgery (TIPS). Methods. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was selected to test the TIPS framework on an unusual and complex procedure. No commercial simulation module exists to teach this procedure. A specialist surgeon authored the module, including force-feedback interactive simulation, and designed a quiz to test knowledge of the key procedural steps. Five practicing surgeons, with 15 to 24 years of experience, peer reviewed and tested the module. In all, 14 residents and 9 fellows trained with the module and answered the quiz, preuse and postuse. Participants received an overview during Surgical Grand Rounds session and a 20-minute one-on-one tutorial followed by 30 minutes of instruction in addition to a forcefeedback interactive simulation session. Additionally, in answering questionnaires, the trainees reflected on their learning experience and their experience with the TIPS framework. Results. Correct quiz response rates on procedural steps improved significantly postuse over preuse. In the questionnaire, 96% of the respondents stated that the TIPS module prepares them well or very well for the adrenalectomy, and 87% indicated that the module successfully teaches the steps of the procedure. All participants indicated that they preferred the module compared to training using purely physical props, one-on-one teaching, medical atlases, and video recordings. Conclusions. Improved quiz scores and endorsement by the participants of the TIPS adrenalectomy module establish the viability of surgeons authoring VR training.

Virtual Anatomical and Endoscopic Exploration Method of Internal Human Body for Training Simulator,"Kwon, K.; Park, J. S.; Shin, B. S.","BACKGROUND: Virtual environments have brought the use of realistic training closer to many different fields of education. In medical education, several visualization methods for studying inside the human body have been introduced as a way to verify the structure of internal organs. However, these methods are insufficient for realistic training simulators because they do not provide photorealistic scenes or offer an intuitive perception to the user. In addition, they are used in limited environments within a classroom setting. METHOD(S): We have developed a virtual dissection exploration system that provides realistic three-dimensional images and a virtual endoscopic experience. This system enables the user to manipulate a virtual camera through a human organ, using gesture-sensing technology. We can make a virtual dissection image of the human body using a virtual dissection simulator and then navigate inside an organ using a virtual endoscope. To improve the navigation performance during virtual endoscopy, our system warns the user about any potential collisions that may occur against the organ's wall by taking the virtual control sphere at the virtual camera position into consideration. RESULT(S): Experimental results show that our system efficiently provides high-quality anatomical visualization. We can simulate anatomic training using virtual dissection and endoscopic images. CONCLUSION(S): Our training simulator would be helpful in training medical students because it provides an immersive environment.

Simulation training also offers a uniform approach to learn surgical skills with immediate feedback. The aim of this article is to review the recent research investigating the use of arthroscopy simulators in training and the teaching of surgical skills. METHOD(S): A systematic review of the Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases for English-language articles published before December 2019 was conducted. The search terms included arthroscopy or arthroscopic in combination with simulation or simulator. RESULT(S): We identified a total of 44 relevant studies involving benchtop or virtually simulated ankle, knee, shoulder, and hip arthroscopy environments. The majority of these studies demonstrated construct and transfer validity; considerably fewer studies demonstrated content and face validity. CONCLUSION(S): Our review indicates that there is a considerable evidence base regarding the use of arthroscopy simulators for training purposes. Further work should focus on the development of a more uniform simulator training course that can be compared with current intraoperative training in large-scale trials with long-term follow-up at tertiary centers.

Virtual reality simulation to enhance laparoscopic salpingectomy skills,"Lamblin, G.; Thiberville, G.; Druette, L.; Moret, S.; Couraud, S.; Martin, X.; Dubernard, G.; Chene, G.","Background: To assess skill enhancement and maintenance by virtual-reality simulation of laparoscopic salpingectomy in gynecologic surgery fellows. Skill acquisition by virtual-reality surgical simulation is an active field of research and technological development. Salpingectomy is one of the first gynecologic surgery techniques taught to fellows that requires accompanied learning. Method(s): A single-center prospective study was performed in the University of Lyon, France, including 26 junior fellows (<= 3 semesters' internship) performing laparoscopic salpingectomy exercises on a LapSim virtual reality simulator. Salpingectomy was performed and timed on 3 trials in session 1 and 3 trials in session 2, at a 3-month interval. Analysis was based on students' subjective assessments and a senior surgeon's objective assessment of skill. Progress between the 2 sessions was assessed on McNemar test and Wilcoxon test for matched series. Result(s): 26 junior specialist trainees performed all trials. Most performed anterograde salpingectomy, both in session 1 (69 %) and session 2 (86 %). Mean procedure time was significantly shorter in session 2: 6.10 min versus 7.82 min (p = 0.0003). There was a significant decrease in blood loss between the first trial in session 1 and the last trial in session 2: 167 ml versus 70.3 ml (p = 0.02). Subjective assessment showed a significant decrease in anxiety and significant increase in perceived efficacy, eye-hand coordination and ergonomics. Efficacy, performance quality and speed of execution as assessed by the senior surgeon all improved significantly from trial to trial, while hesitation significantly decreased. Conclusion(s): The study showed that junior trainees improved their surgical skills on a short laparoscopic exercise using a virtual reality simulator. Virtual reality simulation is useful in the early learning curve, accelerating the acquisition of reflexes. Maintaining skill requires simulation sessions at shorter intervals.

The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of setting up an on-site virtual reality surgical training hub for an orthopaedic surgery unit. A secondary objective was to document encountered hurdles to assist other institutions with a similar process. METHOD(S): The study explored the logistical and organizational considerations in the process of creating a virtual reality training area. This included: review of location, set up management, funding arrangements, set up time, research opportunities and training time. Set up and completion times were recorded during a separate trial of 24 participants ranging from medical students to senior consultant orthopaedic surgeons. RESULT(S): A VR training area was successfully established over a period of 3months. A dedicated area for training where the equipment remains permanently was designated to facilitate ease of use. Average set up took 7.5 min to turn the computer on and 25min for the participants to start the module. Issues identified during set up were recorded. CONCLUSION(S): The study demonstrated that it is possible to set up a dedicated area for virtual reality surgical training within a hospital unit.

Method(s): We randomized lay bystanders to either our intervention arm (VR mApp) or our control arm (mApp). During a post-intervention skills test, we collected bystander response data (call 911, perform CPR, ask for an automated external defibrillator (AED)), along with CPR quality (chest compression (CC) rate and depth). Wilcox rank sum was used to analyze CC rate and CC depth as they were not normally distributed; Pearson's Chi-square was used to analyze Chain of Survival variables.

Bystander response was significantly higher in the VR mApp arm: called 911 (82% vs 58%, p = 0.007) and asked for an AED (57% vs 28%, p = 0.003). However there was no difference in CPR performed (98% vs 98%, p = NS) and the application of the AED (90% vs 93%, p = NS). When comparing the VR mApp to the mApp, mean CC rate was 104 +/- 42 cpm vs 112 +/- 30 cpm (p = NS), and mean CC depth was 38 +/- 15 mm vs 44 +/- 13 mm (p = 0.05). Conclusion(s): The use of the VR mApp significantly increased the likelihood of calling 911 and asking for an AED, however, CC depth was decreased.

Improving Academic Performance in Medical Students Using Immersive Virtual Patient Simulation: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Lebdai, S.; Mauget, M.; Cousseau, P.; Granry, J. C.; Martin, L.","Objectives: To determine whether immersive virtual patient simulation (IVPS) on the MedicActiv platform is influential in improving student academic performance in module validation tests. Design(s): In this prospective randomized controlled study a comparison was made between IVPS training combined with regular faculty courses versus courses alone. The primary endpoint was module validation grades. Secondary endpoints were satisfaction scores (overall interest, ergonomics, realism, immersion, and training efficiency). Setting(s): Angers School of Medicine, France. Participant(s): 2018 to 2019 class of fourth-year students, included on a voluntary basis. In the first semester 51 students were included, of whom 13 were excluded for lack of compliance (6 and 7 from the IVPS and control groups, respectively). In the second semester we included 57 students, of whom 10 were excluded for lack of compliance (2 and 8 from the IVPS and control groups, respectively). Result(s): Mean age was 21 years (+/-0.8). There were 85 female and 23 male students. In the first semester mean grades were 13.4 +/- 1.6 versus 11/.9 +/- 2.4 in the IVPS and control groups, respectively (p = 0.038). In the second semester mean grades were 15.3 +/- 2.5 versus 11.9 +/- 3.6 in the IVPS and control groups, respectively p < 0.001. The entire study population was pooled (n = 85): mean grades were 14.5 +/- 2.4 versus 11.9 +/- 3 in the IVPS group and the control group, respectively, p < 0.001. The satisfaction questionnaire response rate was 54% (46/85). Score percentages >=4 regarding overall interest, ergonomics, realism, immersion and training efficiency were 89%, 85%, 100%, 93%, and 93% respectively. Conclusion(s): Complementing conventional university education with simulation of virtual consultation cases on the MedicActiv platform improved student academic performance as compared with students studying regular courses. Students reported high levels of satisfaction with overall interest, ergonomics, realism, immersion and training efficiency on the MedicActiv platform.

Observational Learning During Simulation-Based Training in Arthroscopy: Is It Useful to Novices?,"LeBel, M. E.; Haverstock, J.; Cristancho, S.; van Eimeren, L.; Buckingham, G.","Objective: Observing experts constitutes an important and common learning experience for surgical residents before operating under direct guidance. However, studies suggest that exclusively observing experts may induce suboptimal motor learning, and watching errors from non-experts performing simple motor tasks may generate better performance. We investigated whether observational learning is transferrable to arthroscopy learning using virtual reality (VR) simulation. Setting/Design: In our surgical simulation laboratory, we compared students learning basic skills on a VR arthroscopy simulator after watching an expert video demonstration of VR arthroscopy tasks or a non-expert video demonstration of the same tasks to a Control group without video demonstration. Ninety students in 3 observing groups (expert, non-expert, and Control) subsequently completed the same procedure on a VR arthroscopy simulator. We hypothesized the non-expert-watching group would outperform the expert-watching group, and both groups to outperform the Control group. We examined performance pretest, posttest, and 1 week later. Participant(s): Participants were recruited from the final year of medical school and the very early first year of surgical residency training programs (orthopaedic surgery, urology, plastic surgery, and general surgery) at Western University (Ontario, Canada). Result(s): All participants improved their overall performance from pretest to retention (p < 0.001). At initial retention testing, non-expert-watching group outperformed the other groups in camera path length p < 0.05 and time to completion, p < 0.05, and both the expert/non-expert groups surpassed the Control group in camera path length (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): We suggest that error-observation may contribute to skills improvement in the non-expert-watching group. Allowing novices to observe techniques/errors of other novices may assist internalization of specific movements/skills required for effective motor performances. This study highlights the potential effect of observational learning on surgical skills acquisition and offers preliminary evidence for peer-based practice (combined non-experts and experts) as a complementary surgical motor skills training strategy.

M.; Bissonnette, V.; Bajunaid, K.; Sabbagh, A. J.; Del Maestro, R. F.","OBJECTIVE: Understanding the variation of learning curves of experts and trainees for a given surgical procedure is important in implementing formative learning paradigms to accelerate mastery. The study objectives were to use artificial intelligence (AI)-derived metrics to determine the learning curves of participants in 4 groups with different expertise levels who performed a series of identical virtual reality (VR) subpial resection tasks and to identify learning curve differences among the 4 groups. METHOD(S): A total of 50 individuals participated, 14 neurosurgeons, 4 neurosurgical fellows and 10 senior residents (seniors), 10 junior residents (juniors), and 12 medical students. All participants performed 5 repetitions of a subpial tumor resection on the NeuroVR (CAE Healthcare) platform, and 6 a priori-derived metrics selected using the K-nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm were used to assess participant learning curves. Group learning curves were plotted over the 5 trials for each metric. A mixed, repeated-measures ANOVA was performed between the first and fifth trial. For significant interactions (p < 0.05), post hoc Tukey's HSD analysis was conducted to determine the location of the significance. RESULT(S): Overall, 5 of the 6 metrics assessed had a significant interaction (p < 0.05). The 4 groups, neurosurgeons, seniors, juniors, and medical students, showed an improvement between the first and fifth trial on at least one of the 6 metrics evaluated. CONCLUSION(S): Learning curves generated using AI-derived metrics provided novel insights into technical skill acquisition, based on expertise level, during repeated VR-simulated subpial tumor resections, which will allow educators to develop more focused formative educational paradigms for neurosurgical trainees.",2022,4-Feb,Journal of Neurosurgery,,,12-Jan,637176640,,,#2834,Ledwos 2022,,

Graduate students (n = 35) from five different health professions programs (medicine, nursing, nutrition, physical therapy, and social work) across two educational institutions participated in a small-group immersive educational experience focused on palliative care in the virtual world of Second Life. Collected data included pre and post surveys of interprofessional attitudes using previously-published questionnaires as well as student reflective writing and photographs about their experience. We found it was feasible to create and deliver an interprofessional educational experience in palliative care in a virtual world environment. The educational experience was acceptable to participants, with an improvement in attitudes toward interprofessional education and interprofessional teamwork after a single virtual world educational session, based on both quantitative and qualitative results. Students found the virtual world environment acceptable for interprofessional education focused on palliative care, based on qualitative results.

H.","Background: Conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training for the general public involves the use of a manikin and a training video, which has limitations related to a lack of realism and immersion. To overcome these limitations, virtual reality and extended reality technologies are being used in the field of medical education. The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of extended reality (XR)-based basic life support (BLS) training. Method(s): This study is a prospective, multinational, multicentre, randomised controlled study. Four institutions in 4 countries will participate in the study. A total of 154 participants will be randomly assigned to either the XR group or the conventional group stratified by institution and sex (1:1 ratio). Each participant who is allocated to either group will be sent to a separate room to receive training with an XR BLS module or conventional CPR training video. All participants will perform a test on a CPR manikin after the training. The primary outcome will be mean compression depth. The secondary outcome will be overall BLS performance, including compression rate, correct hand position, compression, and full release and hands-off time. Discussion(s): Using virtual reality (VR) to establish a virtual educational environment can give trainees a sense of realism. In the XR environment, which combines the virtual world with the real world, trainees can more effectively learn various skills.

Can a virtual reality surgical simulation training provide a self-driven and mentor-free skills learning? Investigation of the practical influence of the performance metrics from the virtual reality robotic surgery simulator on the skill learning and associated cognitive workloads,"Lee, G. I.; Lee, M. R.","Background: While it is often claimed that virtual reality (VR) training system can offer self-directed and mentor-free skill learning using the system's performance metrics (PM), no studies have yet provided evidence-based confirmation. This experimental study investigated what extent to which trainees achieved their self-learning with a current VR simulator and whether additional mentoring improved skill learning, skill transfer and cognitive workloads in robotic surgery simulation training. Method(s): Thirty-two surgical trainees were randomly assigned to either the Control-Group (CG) or Experiment-Group (EG). While the CG participants reviewed the PM at their discretion, the EG participants had explanations about PM and instructions on how to improve scores. Each subject completed a 5-week training using four simulation tasks. Pre- and post-training data were collected using both a simulator and robot. Peri-training data were collected after each session. Skill learning, time spent on PM (TPM), and cognitive workloads were compared between groups. Result(s): After the simulation training, CG showed substantially lower simulation task scores (82.9 +/- 6.0) compared with EG (93.2 +/- 4.8). Both groups demonstrated improved physical model tasks performance with the actual robot, but the EG had a greater improvement in two tasks. The EG exhibited lower global mental workload/distress, higher engagement, and a better understanding regarding using PM to improve performance. The EG's TPM was initially long but substantially shortened as the group became familiar with PM. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated that the current VR simulator offered limited self-skill learning and additional mentoring still played an important role in improving the robotic surgery simulation training.

Implementation and Evaluation of a Virtual Reality Simulation: Intravenous Injection Training System,"Lee, J. S.","In nursing education, virtual reality simulation (VRS) is recognized as an effective learning method as it overcomes limitations in practical training and positively influences learning ability and satisfaction levels. The purpose of this study was to develop VRS for intravenous (IV) injection and investigate how it affects nursing students' academic knowledge, performance confidence, and clinical practice competencies. A quasi-experimental control group pretest and post-test design was used. Participants were nursing students who either received a training system for an IV injection through VRS (experimental group; n = 20) or who received an IV arm simulator (control group; n = 20). The results revealed significantly higher knowledge (U = 156.5, p = 0.024) and clinical performance competency (U = 87.5, p = 0.002) with the procedure of using a training system of VRS for IV injection compared to having training via an IV arm simulator. This study verified that VRS for IV injection was more effective than an IV arm simulator for practical training on IV injection. Thus, VRS for IV injection, an effective teaching method used to improve learning ability and satisfaction levels, can be used as a training method in the future. Copyright © 2022 by the author.

Cadaver-Free Neurosurgical Simulation Using a 3-Dimensional Printer and Augmented Reality,"Lee, M. H.; Lee, T. K.","BACKGROUND: Training to become a neurosurgeon takes time and effort, with the training requirements continuing to increase. As such, more efficient educational tools are needed. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the use of 3-dimensional (3D) printing and augmented reality (AR) systems within neurosurgical training programs. METHOD(S): The skull and its structures were segmented using normal computed tomography and MRI and printed with a 3D printer. Basic procedures (burr-hole trephination and other craniotomies) and advanced procedures of skull base approaches (anterior clinoidectomy, anterior petrosectomy, and mastoidectomy) were practiced with the printed model. Skull base approaches were practiced in an AR system. After the training program, a questionnaire was administered to the trainees about the effectiveness of the program. RESULT(S): The basic procedure program was conducted four times with 22 trainees. Twenty trainees indicated that the present simulation program was important to their education (average of 4.9/5.0). When asked whether the model was similar to a human skull, the average score was 4.5 of 5 points. The advanced procedure program was conducted five times with 10 trainees. All 10 answered that the simulation program was a useful tool for training on skull base approaches (average of 5/5). All respondents answered that they would be able to perform the skull base approaches in patients after completing the training program (an average of 4.7/5). CONCLUSION(S): The simulation-based training program using 3D-printed anatomy with an AR system was demonstrated to be an important adjunct to training neurosurgery. It provides trainees a realistic environment to improve skills and performance during clinical practice. Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2022.

Usability of mental illness simulation involving scenarios with patients with schizophrenia via immersive virtual reality: A mixed methods study,"Lee, Y.; Kim, S. K.; Eom, M. R.","Objectives Schizophrenia is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses contributing to national burden worldwide. It is well known that mental health nursing education, including clinical placement, is still insufficient to reach the optimal level of competency in nursing students. This study suggests a new form of mental health virtual reality (VR) simulation that is user-friendly and engaging to improve education about schizophrenia, thereby improving its treatment. Method A mixed-methods study was conducted with a total of 60 nursing students, using 360-degree videos of five different scenarios reflecting clinical symptoms of schizophrenia patients and related treatment tasks delivered via head-mounted displays (HMDs). We used a 17-item quantitative questionnaire and a 7-item open-ended qualitative questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use and usefulness of the VR simulation program and to identify areas where further improvement is required. Results The VR simulation program was perceived as useful and exciting. Participants stressed that the high realism of the simulation increased their engagement in and motivation to learn about mental health nursing. Some participants made suggestions, such as further refining the picture and sound quality in order to achieve satisfactory educational outcomes. Conclusion VR simulation using 360-degree videos and HMDs could serve as an effective alternative form of clinical training in mental health nursing. Education could be enhanced by its benefits of being engaging and exciting, as reported by this study's participants. Copyright: © 2020 Lee et al.

Assessment of validity evidence for the RobotiX robot assisted surgery simulator on advanced suturing tasks,"Leijte, E.; de Blaauw, I.; Rosman, C.; Botden, S. M. B. I.","BACKGROUND: Robot assisted surgery has expanded considerably in the past years. Compared to conventional open or laparoscopic surgery, virtual reality (VR) training is an essential component in learning robot assisted surgery. However, for tasks to be implemented in a curriculum, the levels of validity should be studied for proficiency-based training. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the validity evidence of advanced suturing tasks on a robot assisted VR simulator. METHOD(S): Participants were voluntary recruited and divided in the robotic experienced, laparoscopic experienced or novice group, based on self-reported surgical experience. Subsequently, a questionnaire on a five-point Likert scale was completed to assess the content validity. Three component tasks of complex suturing were performed on the RobotiX simulator (Task1: tilted plane needle transfer, Task: 2 intracorporal suturing, Task 3: anastomosis needle transfer). Accordingly, the outcome of the parameters was used to assess construct validity between robotic experienced and novice participants. Composite scores (0-100) were calculated from the construct parameters and corresponding pass/fail scores with false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) percentages. RESULT(S): Fifteen robotic experienced, 26 laparoscopic experienced and 29 novices were recruited. Overall content validity outcomes were scored positively on the realism (mean 3.7), didactic value (mean 4.0) and usability (mean 4.2). Robotic experienced participants significantly outperformed novices and laparoscopic experienced participants on multiple parameters on all three tasks of complex suturing. Parameters showing construct validity mainly consisted of movement parameters, needle precision and task completion time. Calculated composite pass/fail scores between robotic experienced and novice participants resulted for Task 1 in 73/100 (FP 21%, FN 5%), Task 2 in 85/100 (FP 28%, FN 4%) and Task 3 in 64/100 (FP 49%, FN 22%). CONCLUSION(S): This study assessed the validity evidence on multiple levels of the three studied tasks. The participants score the RobotiX good on the content validity level.

Robot assisted versus laparoscopic suturing learning curve in a simulated setting,"Leijte, E.; de Blaauw, I.; Van Workum, F.; Rosman, C.; Botden, S.","Background: Compared to conventional laparoscopy, robot assisted surgery is expected to have most potential in difficult areas and demanding technical skills like minimally invasive suturing. This study was performed to identify the differences in the learning curves of laparoscopic versus robot assisted suturing. Method(s): Novice participants performed three suturing tasks on the EoSim laparoscopic augmented reality simulator or the RobotiX robot assisted virtual reality simulator. Each participant performed an intracorporeal suturing task, a tilted plane needle transfer task and an anastomosis needle transfer task. To complete the learning curve, all tasks were repeated up to twenty repetitions or until a time plateau was reached. Clinically relevant and comparable parameters regarding time, movements and safety were recorded. Intracorporeal suturing time and cumulative sum analysis was used to compare the learning curves and phases. Result(s): Seventeen participants completed the learning curve laparoscopically and 30 robot assisted. Median first knot suturing time was 611 s (s) for laparoscopic versus 251 s for robot assisted (p < 0.001), and this was 324 s versus 165 (sixth knot, p < 0.001) and 257 s and 149 s (eleventh knot, p < 0.001) respectively on base of the found learning phases. The percentage of 'adequate surgical knots' was higher in the laparoscopic than in the robot assisted group. First knot: 71% versus 60%, sixth knot: 100% versus 83%, and eleventh knot: 100% versus 73%. When assessing the 'instrument out of view' parameter, the robot assisted group scored a median of 0% after repetition four. In the laparoscopic group, the instrument out of view increased from 3.1 to 3.9% (left) and from 3.0 to 4.1% (right) between the first and eleventh knot (p > 0.05).

"VERT, a virtual clinical environment, enhances understanding of radiation therapy planning concepts","Leong, A.; Herst, P.; Kane, P.","Introduction: The ability to understand treatment plan dosimetry and apply this understanding clinically is fundamental to the role of the radiation therapist. This study evaluates whether or not the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training (VERT) contributes to teaching treatment planning concepts to a cohort of first-year radiation therapy students. Method(s): We directly compared a custom-developed VERT teaching module with a standard teaching module with respect to the understanding of treatment planning concepts using a cross-over design. Students self-reported their understanding of specific concepts before and after delivery of the VERT and standard teaching modules and evaluated aspects of VERT as a learning experience. In addition, teaching staff participated in a semi-structured interview discussing the modules from an educational perspective. Result(s): Both the standard teaching module and VERT teaching module enhanced conceptual understanding and level of confidence in the student cohort after both teaching periods. The proportion of students reporting a perceived increase in knowledge/confidence was similar for the VERT teaching module for all but two scenarios. We propose that an integrated approach, providing a strong theoretical conceptual framework, followed by VERT to situate this framework in the (simulated) clinical environment combines the best of both teaching approaches. Conclusion(s): This study has established for the first time a clear role for a tailored VERT teaching module in teaching RT planning concepts because of its ability to visualise conceptual information within a simulated clinical environment.

VR Simulation Leads to Enhanced Procedural Confidence for Surgical Trainees,"Lesch, H.; Johnson, E.; Peters, J.; Cendan, J. C.","Objective: Active learning techniques result in greater knowledge acquisition compared to passive methods. For medical students with limited hands-on operative experiences, virtual reality platforms represent active learning and may enhance procedural training. We hypothesize that virtual reality simulators like Toolkit for Illustration of Procedures in Surgery (TIPS) are a more effective modality in teaching laparoscopic surgical techniques to medical students when compared to passive learning tools like videos. Design(s): In this crossover study, participants were randomly assigned to perform either a TIPS laparoscopic appendectomy followed by video of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or video of a laparoscopic appendectomy followed by TIPS laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A knowledge assessment followed each intervention. A postsurvey was used to gather feedback and subjective impressions of the learning experience. Setting(s): University of Central Florida College of Medicine. Participant(s): Second, third, and fourth-year medical students (n = 37). Result(s): Validation of the content assessments revealed strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.73). A 2-tailed Fisher's exact test revealed that the video had greater ease of use (p = 0.032), but TIPS had greater utility as a learning tool (p < 0.001) and instilled greater confidence in the ability to reproduce procedural steps (p < 0.001). A 2-tailed t test of the average content quiz scores revealed no significant difference in percentage correct between groups on the laparoscopic appendectomy quiz (p = 0.772), but a difference favoring video learning on the laparoscopic cholecystectomy quiz (p = 0.042) Conclusion(s): Video and TIPS both enhanced different aspects of student learning; however, the active TIPS platform produced greater confidence in the ability to reproduce the steps of the procedure and had greater utility as a learning strategy.

Real-time needle force modeling for VR-based renal biopsy training with respiratory motion using direct clinical data,"Li, F.; Tai, Y.; Li, Q.; Peng, J.; Huang, X.; Chen, Z.; Shi, J.","Realistic tool-tissue interactive modeling has been recognized as an essential requirement in the training of virtual surgery. A virtual basic surgical training framework integrated with real-time force rendering has been recognized as one of the most immersive implementations in medical education. Yet, compared to the original intraoperative data, there has always been an argument that these data are represented by lower fidelity in virtual surgical training. In this paper, a dynamic biomechanics experimental framework is designed to achieve a highly immersive haptic sensation during the biopsy therapy with human respiratory motion; it is the first time to introduce the idea of periodic extension idea into the dynamic percutaneous force modeling. Clinical evaluation is conducted and performed in the Yunnan First People's Hospital, which not only demonstrated a higher fitting degree (AVG: 99.36%) with the intraoperation data than previous algorithms (AVG: 87.83%, 72.07%, and 66.70%) but also shows a universal fitting range with multilayer tissue. 27 urologists comprising 18 novices and 9 professors were invited to the VR-based training evaluation based on the proposed haptic rendering solution. Subjective and objective results demonstrated higher performance than the existing benchmark training simulator. Combining these in a systematic approach, tuned with specific fidelity requirements, haptically enabled medical simulation systems would be able to provide a more immersive and effective training environment.

J.","Objective: To explore the effect of the application of mixed reality (MR) technology in clinical teaching of fibular flap preparation. Method(s): Twenty residents from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in School of Stomatology, the Fourth Military Medical University in 2018 and 2019 participated in the present study. They were randomly divided into two groups according to the method of random drawing. The teaching content of the two groups was fibular flap preparation. The MR group was taught by using the new teaching mode which was mainly based on MR, while the conventional teaching group was educated by conventional teaching method. At the end of the training, the theoretical knowledge and operational skills of the residents were statistically analyzed to evaluate the learning effect. Questionnaire survey was also conducted. Each item in the questionnaire was scored between 0 and 5, representing poor to excellent. Result(s): The theoretical scores of MR group (91.4+/-4.4) were higher than that of the conventional teaching group (83.3+/-3.2) (P<0.01). The durations of preoperative marking and simulated osteotomy in MR group [(5.7+/-1.2) and (20.9+/-2.28) min, respectively] were shorter than those in the conventional teaching group [(7.2+/-1.7) and (26.1+/-3.6) min, respectively] (P<0.05). The results of the questionnaire showed that MR group had a significant improvement in the scores of classroom atmosphere, satisfaction, three-dimensional construction, theoretical knowledge and problem-solving ability (P<0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference in scores of learning concentration between the two groups (P>0.05).

A novel augmented reality navigation system for endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery: A feasibility study,"Li, L.; Yang, J.; Chu, Y.; Wu, W.; Xue, J.; Liang, P.; Chen, L.","Objective. To verify the reliability and clinical feasibility of a self-developed navigation system based on an augmented reality technique for endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery. Materials and Methods In this study we performed a head phantom and cadaver experiment to determine the display effect and accuracy of our navigational system. We compared cadaver head-based simulated operations, the target registration error, operation time, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores of our navigation system to conventional navigation systems. Results. The navigation system developed in this study has a novel display mode capable of fusing endoscopic images to three-dimensional (3-D) virtual images. In the cadaver head experiment, the target registration error was 1.28 +/- 0.45 mm, which met the accepted standards of a navigation system used for nasal endoscopic surgery. Compared with conventional navigation systems, the new system was more effective in terms of operation time and the mental workload of surgeons, which is especially important for less experienced surgeons. Conclusion. The self-developed augmented reality navigation system for endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery appears to have advantages that outweigh those of conventional navigation systems. We conclude that this navigational system will provide rhinologists with more intuitive and more detailed imaging information, thus reducing the judgment time and mental workload of surgeons when performing complex sinus and skull base surgeries. Ultimately, this new navigational system has potential to increase the quality of surgeries. In addition, Copyright © 2016 Li et al.

Effective Skill Transfer From Fundamentals of Arthroscopic Surgery Training to Shoulder Arthroscopic Simulator in Novices,"Liao, R.; Yang, Y.; Li, W.; Li, Z.; Li, X.; Xiong, W.; Lin, C.; Xiao, Y.; Tian, J.","Purpose: To investigate whether novices could improve performance on a shoulder arthroscopic simulator (high-fidelity) through short-term training on a Fundamentals of Arthroscopic Surgery Training (FAST) simulator (low-fidelity). Method(s): Twenty-eight novices with no experience in arthroscopy were recruited to perform a pre-test on a shoulder arthroscopic simulator. Then they were randomized into two groups: the experimental group practiced five modules on the FAST simulator three times, and the control group did nothing. The experimental group performed a post-test immediately after FAST simulator practice. Control group rested for 70 minutes after experiencing pre-test before performing post-test. All parameters were recorded by the simulator. Result(s): The experimental group outperformed the control group in terms of total score, procedure time, camera path length, and grasper path length. However, there was no statistical difference in scratching of humerus cartilage or glenoid cartilage. Significant differences were found in the improvement of both groups in total score, procedure time, and camera path length. Conclusion(s): Arthroscopic skills gained after short-term training on FAST simulator could be transferred to the shoulder arthroscopic simulator. This research provides important evidence of the benefits of FAST simulator in shoulder arthroscopy training program.

"Wow, woo, win""- Healthcare students' and facilitators' experiences of interprofessional simulation in three-dimensional virtual world: A qualitative evaluation study","Liaw, S. Y.; Choo, T.; Wu, L. T.; Lim, W. S.; Choo, H.; Lim, S. M.; Ringsted, C.; Wong, L. F.; Ooi, S. L.; Lau, T. C.","BACKGROUND: In an age disrupted by COVID-19 pandemic, three-dimensional virtual world (3DVW) offers an opportunity for healthcare students from different higher education institutions to participate in interprofessional education. Despite its growing evidence, there is a need to unravel the complex learning process in order to ensure high quality of interprofessional education delivery. AIM: This study aimed to explore the experiences of healthcare students and facilitators on the use of 3DVW for interprofessional team-based virtual simulation. METHOD(S): Interprofessional teams, each comprising six different healthcare students (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Medical Social Work) and two clinicians who acted as facilitators, logged into the 3DVW from their own remote locations to participate in team-based care delivery that included an interprofessional bedside round and a family conference. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted on a purposive sample of 30 healthcare students and 12 facilitators using focus group discussions and individual interviews. RESULT(S): Four themes emerged from their experiences: the ""wow experience"", authentic experience on collaborative care, ease of learning, and preeminent role of the facilitator. The simulation provided the ""wow"" experiences through contextual, collaborative and experiential learning approaches. Despite technical challenges, the participants were wooed by the comforts of learning from home and the psychological safety in virtual environment. The facilitators played a critical role in optimizing learning engagement to win learners over. CONCLUSION(S): Our study explicates how attention to the ""wow, woo and win"" trilateral factors can transform the interprofessional learning experiences offered by 3DVW simulation. Future developments in the use of this learning technology should include developing the clinicians' facilitation skills and the provision of technical support to make this 3DVW a success calls in winning students' learning engagement.

Translation of an evidence-based virtual reality simulation-based interprofessional education into health education curriculums: An implementation science method,"Liaw, S. Y.; Ooi, S. L.; Mildon, R.; Ang, E. N. K.; Lau, T. C.; Chua, W. L.","BACKGROUND: The development of interprofessional competencies through an evidence-based program is paramount to nurture a collaborative practice-ready workforce for patient-centered care and safety. AIMS: To describe an implementation science approach for translation of an evidence-based virtual reality simulation-based interprofessional education (VR-Sim-IPE) program into medical and nursing curriculums, and to evaluate the implementation outcomes. METHOD(S): Implementation strategies from the ""Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change"" were used to support implementation of the VR-Sim-IPE program. This included recruiting and training 28 practicing clinicians as facilitators to deliver the program to 599 medical and nursing students. Proctor's conceptual framework for implementation outcomes was applied with multiple data collection methods to evaluate the VR-Sim-IPE program. An online survey was administered to measure the levels of acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and adoption. Forty-four sessions of structured observations were carried out to examine the facilitators' implementation fidelity. Individual interviews were conducted with 15 facilitators to identify the facilitators and barriers to the program implementation. An implementation cost analysis was also conducted. RESULT(S): Both facilitators and students had positive perceptions of the acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, and feasibility of the VR-Sim-IPE program. Facilitators were observed to implement the program with high fidelity, including program adherence, dosage, quality of delivery, and student responsiveness. While opportunities to contribute and learn, as well as receiving training and support, were identified as facilitators to implementation, the lack of familiarity with the virtual environment, varying levels of student participation, and facilitating interprofessional groups were reported barriers. The implementation costs amounted to USD45,648.50. CONCLUSION(S): The evaluation of implementation outcomes identifies strategies for future implementation that could potentially enhance program acceptance, reduce implementation cost, improve penetration, and achieve program sustainability. These include increasing facilitation group size, preparing students to be active participants, and incorporating interprofessional facilitation skills in facilitators' training.

Nurse-Physician Communication Team Training in Virtual Reality Versus Live Simulations: Randomized Controlled Trial on Team Communication and Teamwork Attitudes,"Liaw, S. Y.; Ooi, S. W.; Rusli, K. D. B.; Lau, T. C.; Tam, W. W. S.; Chua, W. L.","BACKGROUND: Interprofessional team training is needed to improve nurse-physician communication skills that are lacking in clinical practice. Using simulations has proven to be an effective learning approach for team training. Yet, it has logistical constraints that call for the exploration of virtual environments in delivering team training. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to evaluate a team training program using virtual reality vs conventional live simulations on medical and nursing students' communication skill performances and teamwork attitudes. METHOD(S): In June 2018, the authors implemented nurse-physician communication team training using communication tools. A randomized controlled trial study was conducted with 120 undergraduate medical and nursing students who were randomly assigned to undertake team training using virtual reality or live simulations. The participants from both groups were tested on their communication performances through team-based simulation assessments. Their teamwork attitudes were evaluated using interprofessional attitude surveys that were administered before, immediately after, and 2 months after the study interventions. RESULT(S): The team-based simulation assessment revealed no significant differences in the communication performance posttest scores (P=.29) between the virtual and simulation groups. Both groups reported significant increases in the interprofessional attitudes posttest scores from the baseline scores, with no significant differences found between the groups over the 3 time points. CONCLUSION(S): Our study outcomes did not show an inferiority of team training using virtual reality when compared with live simulations, which supports the potential use of virtual reality to substitute conventional simulations for communication team training. Future studies can leverage the use of artificial intelligence technology in virtual reality to replace costly human-controlled facilitators to achieve better scalability and sustainability of team-based training in interprofessional education.

F.","BACKGROUND: Collaborative learning in interprofessional team care delivery across different healthcare courses and institutions is constrained by geographical locations and tedious scheduling. Three dimensional virtual environments (3D-VE) are a viable and innovative tool to bring diverse healthcare students to learn together. AIM: The aim of this study is to describe the development of a 3D-VE and to evaluate healthcare students' experiences of their collaborative learning in the environment. METHOD(S): A mixed methods study design was employed. Participants from six healthcare courses (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Medical Social Work) were recruited from three institutions to form six interprofessional teams to participate in team care delivery via a 3D-VE. Pre- and post-tests were conducted to evaluate the students' attitudes toward healthcare teams and interprofessional collaboration. Four focus groups were conducted with 27 healthcare students after they completed questionnaires to evaluate their perceived usability, the sociability of computer-supported collaborative learning, and senses of presence. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULT(S): The students demonstrated significant improvements in their attitudes toward healthcare teams (p<0.05) and interprofessional collaboration (p<0.001) after the collaborative learning. Four themes emerged from the focus group discussions: ""feeling real"", whereby the students felt immersed in their own roles; the virtual environment was perceived as ""less threatening"" compared to face-to-face interactions; ""understanding each other's roles"" among different healthcare professionals; and there were some ""technical hiccups"" related to sound quality and navigation. The participants reported positively on the usability (mean 3.48, SD 0.64), feasibility (mean 3.39, SD 0.60) and perceived sense of presence (mean 107.24, SD 17.78) of the 3D-VE in supporting collaborative learning.

T.; Ignacio, J.","Background: Simulation-based education can equip healthcare providers with the ability to respond to and manage stressors associated with rapidly deteriorating patient situations. However, little is known about the benefits of using virtual reality (VR) for this purpose. Objective(s): To compare between desktop VR and face-to-face simulation in stress responses and performance outcomes of a team-based simulation training in managing clinical deterioration. Design(s): A randomised controlled study Method: The study was conducted on 120 medical and nursing students working in interprofessional teams. The teams were randomly assigned to participate in a 2-h simulation using either the desktop VR or face-to-face simulation with simulated patient (SP). Biophysiological stress response, psychological stress, and confidence levels were measured before and after the simulation. Performance outcomes were evaluated after the simulation using a deteriorating patient scenario. Result(s): The systolic blood pressure and psychological stress response were significantly increased among participants in VR and SP groups; however, no significant differences were found between the groups. There was also no significant difference in confidence and performance outcomes between participants in the VR and SP groups for both medical and nursing students. Although the psychological stress response was negatively correlated (r = -0.43; p < 0.01) with confidence levels, there was no association between stress response and performance score. Conclusion(s): Despite being less immersive, the desktop VR was capable of inducing psychological and physiological stress responses by placing emotional, social, and cognitive demands on learners. Additionally, by ensuring close alignment between the simulation tasks and the clinical tasks (i.e. functional fidelity), the desktop VR may provide similar performance outcomes as conventional simulation training. This evidence is timely given the rise in the use of virtual learning platforms to facilitate training during the COVID-19 pandemic where face-to-face training may not be feasible.

However, incorporation of virtual reality curricula into formal training programmes has been limited. We describe a multi-centre effort to develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of a virtual reality curriculum for residents participating in paediatric cardiology rotations. Method(s): A virtual reality software program (""The Stanford Virtual Heart"") was utilised. Users are placed ""inside the heart""and explore non-traditional views of cardiac anatomy. Modules for six common congenital heart lesions were developed, including narrative scripts. A prospective case-control study was performed involving three large paediatric residency programmes. From July 2018 to June 2019, trainees participating in an outpatient cardiology rotation completed a 27-question, validated assessment tool. From July 2019 to February 2020, trainees completed the virtual reality curriculum and assessment tool during their cardiology rotation. Qualitative feedback on the virtual reality experience was also gathered. Intervention and control group performances were compared using univariate analyses. Result(s): There were 80 trainees in the control group and 52 in the intervention group. Trainees in the intervention group achieved higher scores on the assessment (20.4 +/- 2.9 versus 18.8 +/- 3.8 out of 27 questions answered correctly, p = 0.01). Further analysis showed significant improvement in the intervention group for questions specifically testing visuospatial concepts. In total, 100% of users recommended integration of the programme into the residency curriculum.

Applications of Future Technologies to Detect Skill Decay and Improve Procedural Performance,"Linde, A. S.; Miller, G. T.","Medical simulation training has progressed in its use of incorporating various technologies to provide quality training interfaces from novices to experts. The purpose of this paper is to explore modeling, simulation and visualization training technology interfaces to improve precision learning, rigorous, objective assessment, and performance improvement feedback for clinical procedural skill training and sustainment. Technologies to include augmented reality (AR), haptic technology and computer vision will be defined and clarified. It is believed that by exploring the combination of using AR, haptics and computer vision technologies it is possible to develop a fully immersive learning system that can automate mentoring while detecting and measuring gross and fine motor skills. Such a system can be used to predict or delay the onset of skills decay (SD) by capturing rigorous, objective measures, and human performance metrics that can provide feedback to individual performers for skills improvement in real time.

Using Virtual Simulation To Increase Deep Learning in Radiography Students,"Little, J.","PURPOSE: To discuss recent studies that validate the combination of traditional teaching and virtual simulation training in reducing common errors, enhancing students' confidence, improving their performance, and increasing deep learning. METHOD(S): Multiple electronic databases were searched for learning environment concepts such as deep- vs surface-learning approaches, online vs face-to-face instruction, and the usefulness of virtual simulation laboratories between 1999 to the present. RESULT(S): Deep-learning approaches allow students to engage in higher-quality learning (eg, understanding of the discipline and thinking critically) than do surface-learning approaches. Instructors are shifting from traditional face-to-face learning environments to online environments, including virtual simulation. Virtual simulation alone does not guarantee deep learning; instructional design and guidelines determine whether students use deep- or surface-learning approaches. DISCUSSION: Most radiologic technology programs currently use a traditional x-ray laboratory to teach students positioning and radiation dose techniques. Virtual simulation offers a harmless and convenient learning environment that permits students to practice techniques without the risks of irradiating patients. Instructors can foster deep learning in virtual simulation laboratory environments by designing the software around particular course outcomes (eg, cognitive and psychomotor skills) and engaging with sound educational strategies and theory. CONCLUSION(S): By understanding deep learning that is taking place in radiologic science laboratory learning environments, educators will be able to design virtual simulation courses that foster deeper learning.

A Wearable Augmented Reality Navigation System for Surgical Telementoring Based on Microsoft HoloLens,"Liu, P.; Li, C.; Xiao, C.; Zhang, Z.; Ma, J.; Gao, J.; Shao, P.; Valerio, I.; Pawlik, T. M.; Ding, C.; Yilmaz, A.; Xu, R.","This paper reports a new type of augmented reality (AR) system that integrates a Microsoft HoloLens device with a three-dimensional (3D) point tracking module for medical training and telementored surgery. In this system, a stereo camera is used to track the 3D position of a scalpel and transfer its coordinates wirelessly to a HoloLens device. In the scenario of surgical training, a virtual surgical scene with pre-recorded surgical annotations is superimposed with the actual surgical scene so that the surgical trainee is able to operate following virtual instructions. In the scenario of telementored surgery, the virtual surgical scene is co-registered with the actual surgical scene so that the virtual scalpel remotely mentored by an experienced surgeon provides the AR guidance for the inexperienced on-site operator. The performance characteristics of the proposed AR telementoring system are verified by benchtop experiments. The clinical applicability of the proposed system in telementored skin grafting surgery and fasciotomy is validated in a New Zealand rabbit model.

Background(s): Existing models for laparoscopic training, such as box trainers and virtual reality simulators, often fail to provide holistic training and real haptic feedback. We have formulated a new training system that addresses these problems. Method(s): Real-Liver Laptrainer consists of a porcine liver, customized mannequin, ex-vivo machine perfusion system, and monitoring software. We made a detailed comparison of Real-Liver Laptrainer with the LapSim virtual reality simulator and the FLS Trainer Box systems. Five laparoscopic surgeons assessed the new system on multiple features. We assessed the performances of 43 trainees who used the new system to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) three times. Result(s): Real-Liver Laptrainer offered more functions and better tactile feedback than the FLS or LapSim system. All five surgeons graded the quality of the new system as realistic. The utility of the system for training was scored as 3.6 +/- 1.1 on a scale of 1-5. Between the first and third attempts, the number of successfully performed LCs increased (9 vs 14 vs 23; P = .011), while the numbers of liver damage incidents (25 vs. 21 vs. 18, P = .303) and gallbladder perforations decreased (17 vs. 12 vs. 9, P = .163). The mean LC operation time significantly decreased (63 vs. 50 vs. 44, P < .0001). Conclusion(s): Real-Liver Laptrainer is a feasible, stable, and practical training model that has potential for improving the laparoscopic skills of surgeons.

Implementation of augmented reality in operative dentistry learning,"Llena, C.; Folguera, S.; Forner, L.; Rodriguez-Lozano, F. J.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of augmented reality (AR) in the gaining of knowledge and skills amongst dental students in the design of cavity preparations and analyse their degree of satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: AR cavity models were prepared for use with computers and mobile devices. Forty-one students were divided into two groups (traditional teaching methods vs AR). Questionnaires were designed to evaluate knowledge and skills, with the administration of a satisfaction questionnaire for those using AR. The degree of compliance with the standards in cavity design was assessed. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare knowledge and skills between the two groups, and the Wilcoxon test was applied to compare intragroup differences. The chi-square test in turn was used to compare the qualitative parameters of the cavity designs between the groups. Statistical significance was considered for P<.05 in all cases. RESULT(S): No significant differences were observed in level of knowledge before, immediately after or 6 months after teaching between the two groups (P>.05). Although the results corresponding to most of the studied skills parameters were better in the experimental group, significant differences (P<.05) were only founded for cavity depth and extent for Class I and divergence of the buccal and lingual walls for the Class II. The experience was rated as favourable or very favourable by 100% of the participants. The students showed preference for computers (60%) vs mobile devices (10%). CONCLUSION(S): The AR techniques favoured the gaining of knowledge and skills and were regarded as a useful tool by the students. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Use of a virtual 3D anterolateral thigh model in medical education: Augmentation and not replacement of traditional teaching?,"Lo, S.; Abaker, A. S. S.; Quondamatteo, F.; Clancy, J.; Rea, P.; Marriott, M.; Chapman, P.","There is a pressing need for simulated forms of medical, and in particular, anatomical learning. Current modalities of teaching are limited to either traditional 2-dimensional forms of learning, such as textbook, research papers and lectures, or more costly 3-dimensional modes including cadaveric dissection. Despite the overwhelmingly 3-dimensional nature of plastic surgery, virtual 3D models are limited. Here, we provide the first description of the development and utilisation of a virtual 3D flap model in medical education in the undergraduate curriculum. Methods and Results: A 3D anterolateral (ALT) model was developed with close integration of specialists in simulation and visualisation, anatomists and clinicians, allowing 'virtual dissection' of the anatomy of the ALT flap. This was utilised in a B.Sc. Anatomy undergraduate course in 2017/18 and 2018/19. Student feedback noted an overwhelming preference for the 3D model (74%) as the first choice of educational methodology, versus lectures (26%), textbooks (0%) and research papers (0%) (p = 0.0035). Extraneous cognitive load may be reduced with 3D models, with students rating these as easier to learn from than textbook or research papers (p = 0.00014 and p < 0.00001, respectively). Notably, no statistically significant difference was found in the perceived ease of learning between 3D models and lectures. Conclusion(s): This study highlights a striking user preference for virtual 3D models as compared to for traditional teaching methods. Nonetheless, 3D models are likely to enhance rather than replace lectures, with this study suggesting that teaching by experts is likely to remain an essential part of medical education.

T.; Rudran, B.; Beaule, P. E.; Cobb, J. P.","Background:Fully immersive virtual reality (VR) uses headsets to situate a surgeon in a virtual operating room to perform open surgical procedures. The aims of this study were to determine (1) if a VR curriculum for training residents to perform anterior approach total hip replacement (AA-THR) was feasible, (2) if VR enabled residents' performance to be measured objectively, and (3) if cognitive and motor skills that were learned with use of VR were transferred to the physical world. Method(s):The performance of 32 orthopaedic residents (surgical postgraduate years [PGY]-1 through 4) with no prior experience with AA-THR was measured during 5 consecutive VR training and assessment sessions. Outcome measures were related to procedural sequence, efficiency of movement, duration of surgery, and visuospatial precision in acetabular component positioning and femoral neck osteotomy, and were compared with the performance of 4 expert hip surgeons to establish competency-based criteria. Pretraining and post-training assessments on dry bone models were used to assess the transfer of visuospatial skills from VR to the physical world. Result(s):Residents progressively developed surgical skills in VR on a learning curve through repeated practice, plateauing, on average, after 4 sessions (4.1 +/- 0.6 hours); they reached expert VR levels for 9 of 10 metrics (except femoral osteotomy angle). Procedural errors were reduced by 79%, assistive prompts were reduced by 70%, and procedural duration was reduced by 28%. Dominant and nondominant hand movements were reduced by 35% and 36%, respectively, and head movement was reduced by 44%. Femoral osteotomy was performed more accurately, and acetabular implant orientation improved in VR assessments. In the physical world assessments, experts were more accurate than residents prior to simulation, but were matched by residents after simulation for all of the metrics except femoral osteotomy angle. The residents who performed best in VR were the most accurate in the physical world, while 2 residents were unable to achieve competence despite sustained practice. Conclusion(s):For novice surgeons learning AA-THR skills, fully immersive VR technology can objectively measure progress in the acquisition of surgical skills as measured by procedural sequence, efficiency of movement, and visuospatial accuracy. Skills learned in this environment are transferred to the physical environment. Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Virtual reality training improves trainee performance in total hip arthroplasty: A randomized controlled trial,"Logishetty, K.; Rudran, B.; Cobb, J. P.","Aims Arthroplasty skills need to be acquired safely during training, yet operative experience is increasingly hard to acquire by trainees. Virtual reality (VR) training using headsets and motion-tracked controllers can simulate complex open procedures in a fully immersive operating theatre. The present study aimed to determine if trainees trained using VR perform better than those using conventional preparation for performing total hip arthroplasty (THA). Patients and Methods A total of 24 surgical trainees (seven female, 17 male; mean age 29 years (28 to 31)) volunteered to participate in this observer-blinded 1:1 randomized controlled trial. They had no prior experience of anterior approach THA. Of these 24 trainees, 12 completed a six-week VR training programme in a simulation laboratory, while the other 12 received only conventional preparatory materials for learning THA. All trainees then performed a cadaveric THA, assessed independently by two hip surgeons. The primary outcome was technical and non-technical surgical performance measured by a THA-specific procedure-based assessment (PBA). Secondary outcomes were step completion measured by a task-specific checklist, error in acetabular component orientation, and procedure duration. Results VR-trained surgeons performed at a higher level than controls, with a median PBA of Level 3a (procedure performed with minimal guidance or intervention) versus Level 2a (guidance required for most/all of the procedure or part performed). VR-trained surgeons completed 33% more key steps than controls (mean 22 (sd 3) vs 12 (sd 3)), were 12degree more accurate in component orientation (mean error 4degree (sd 6degree) vs 16degree (sd 17degree)), and were 18% faster (mean 42 minutes (sd 7) vs 51 minutes (sd 9)). Conclusion Procedural knowledge and psychomotor skills for THA learned in VR were transferred to cadaveric performance. Basic preparatory materials had limited value for trainees learning a new technique. VR training advanced trainees further up the learning curve, enabling highly precise component orientation and more efficient surgery. VR could augment traditional surgical training to improve how surgeons learn complex open procedures.

Improved Complex Skill Acquisition by Immersive Virtual Reality Training: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Lohre, R.; Bois, A. J.; Athwal, G. S.; Goel, D. P.","Background:There has been limited literature on immersive virtual reality (VR) simulation in orthopaedic education. The purpose of this multicenter, blinded, randomized controlled trial was to determine the validity and efficacy of immersive VR training in orthopaedic resident education. Method(s):Nineteen senior orthopaedic residents (resident group) and 7 consultant shoulder arthroplasty surgeons (expert group) participated in the trial comparing immersive VR with traditional learning using a technical journal article as a control. The examined task focused on achieving optimal glenoid exposure. Participants completed demographic questionnaires, knowledge tests, and a glenoid exposure on fresh-frozen cadavers while being examined by blinded shoulder arthroplasty surgeons. Training superiority was determined by the outcome measures of the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) score, a developed laboratory metric, verbal answers, and time to task completion. Result(s):Immersive VR had greater realism and was superior in teaching glenoid exposure than the control (p = 0.01). The expert group outperformed the resident group on knowledge testing (p = 0.04). The immersive VR group completed the learning activity and knowledge tests significantly faster (p < 0.001) at a mean time (and standard deviation) of 11 +/- 3 minutes than the control group at 20 +/- 4 minutes, performing 3 to 5 VR repeats for a reduction in learning time of 570%. The immersive VR group completed the glenoid exposure significantly faster (p = 0.04) at a mean time of 14 +/- 7 minutes than the control group at 21 +/- 6 minutes, with superior OSATS instrument handling scores (p = 0.03). The immersive VR group scored equivalently in surprise verbal scores (p = 0.85) and written knowledge scores (p = 1.0). Conclusion(s):Immersive VR demonstrated substantially improved translational technical and nontechnical skills acquisition over traditional learning in senior orthopaedic residents. Additionally, the results demonstrate the face, content, construct, and transfer validity for immersive VR.Clinical Relevance:This adequately powered, randomized controlled trial demonstrated how an immersive VR system can efficiently (570%) teach a complex surgical procedure and also demonstrate improved translational skill and knowledge acquisition when compared with a traditional learning method.

Effectiveness of Immersive Virtual Reality on Orthopedic Surgical Skills and Knowledge Acquisition among Senior Surgical Residents: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Lohre, R.; Bois, A. J.; Pollock, J. W.; Lapner, P.; McIlquham, K.; Athwal, G. S.; Goel, D. P.","Importance: Video learning prior to surgery is common practice for trainees and surgeons, and immersive virtual reality (IVR) simulators are of increasing interest for surgical training. The training effectiveness of IVR compared with video training in complex skill acquisition should be studied. Objective(s): To evaluate whether IVR improves learning effectiveness for surgical trainees and to validate a VR rating scale through correlation to real-world performance. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This block randomized, intervention-controlled clinical trial included senior (ie, postgraduate year 4 and 5) orthopedic surgery residents from multiple institutions in Canada during a single training course. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Data were collected from January 30 to February 1, 2020. Intervention(s): An IVR training platform providing a case-based module for reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) for advanced rotator cuff tear arthropathy. Participants were permitted to repeat the module indefinitely. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was a validated performance metric for both the intervention and control groups (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills [OSATS]). Secondary measures included transfer of training (ToT), transfer effectiveness ratio (TER), and cost-effectiveness (CER) ratios of IVR training compared with control. Additional secondary measures included IVR performance metrics measured on a novel rating scale compared with real-world performance. Result(s): A total of 18 senior surgical residents participated; 9 (50%) were randomized to the IVR group and 9 (50%) to the control group. Participant demographic characteristics were not different for age (mean [SD] age: IVR group, 31.1 [2.8] years; control group, 31.0 [2.7] years), gender (IVR group, 8 [89%] men; control group, 6 [67%] men), surgical experience (mean [SD] experience with RSA: IVR group, 3.3 [0.9]; control group, 3.2 [0.4]), or prior simulator use (had experience: IVR group 6 [67%]; control group, 4 [44%]). The IVR group completed training 387% faster considering a single repetition (mean [SD] time for IVR group: 4.1 [2.5] minutes; mean [SD] time for control group: 16.1 [2.6] minutes; difference, 12.0 minutes; 95% CI, 8.8-14.0 minutes; P <.001). The IVR group had significantly better mean (SD) OSATS scores than the control group (15.9 [2.5] vs 9.4 [3.2]; difference, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.3-9.7; P <.001). The IVR group also demonstrated higher mean (SD) verbal questioning scores (4.1 [1.0] vs 2.2 [1.7]; difference, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.1-3.3; P =.03). The IVR score (ie, Precision Score) had a strong correlation to real-world OSATS scores (r = 0.74) and final implant position (r = 0.73). The ToT was 59.4%, based on the OSATS score. The TER was 0.79, and the system was 34 times more cost-effective than control, based on CER. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, surgical training with IVR demonstrated superior learning efficiency, knowledge, and skill transfer. The TER of 0.79 substituted for 47.4 minutes of operating room time when IVR was used for 60 minutes. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04404010.

Mitigating Surgical Skill Decay in Orthopaedics Using Virtual Simulation Learning,"Lohre, R.; Warner, J. J. P.; Morrey, B. R.; Athwal, G. S.; Morrey, M. E.; Mazzocca, A. D.; Goel, D. P.","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted orthopaedic training structures for both surgeons and trainees. The concept of skill decay must be considered during inactivity of elective practice. The purpose of this study was to provide an evidence-based curriculum in association with immersive virtual reality (iVR) to prevent skill decay during periods of training cessation and beyond. METHOD(S): A review of pertinent literature for orthopaedic surgical skill decay was performed. Early experience by faculty instructors and residency and fellowship program directors was gathered from multiple institutions with experience in virtual training methods including iVR. A proposed curriculum for cognitive and manual skill acquisition during COVID-19 was produced from qualitative narrative group opinion. RESULT(S): Skill decay can occur on the order of days to months and is dependent on the initial skill level. A novel curriculum for structured continuing medical education during and after periods of surgical disruption including e-learning, virtual meetings, and iVR simulators was produced from expert opinion and based on competency-based curriculum standards. CONCLUSION(S): Skill decay mitigation strategies should use best available evidence technologies and course structures that satisfy advanced learning concepts. The virtual curriculum including iVR simulators may provide cost-effective solutions to training. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Augmented Reality in Ophthalmology: Technical Innovation Complements Education for Medical Students. [German],"Loidl, M.; Lang, G. K.; Kampmeier, J.; Schneider, A.; Keis, O.; Ochsner, W.; Grab-Kroll, C.","Background At the Medical Faculty of the University of Ulm, the learning objectives of ophthalmology are taught to students in a one-week block course in the fourth year of study. According to the National Competency-based Learning Objective Catalogue Medicine (NKLM), one of these learning objectives is the clinical examination of the eye, including the eye fundus examination. In order to best train this expertise as defined in the NKLM, a novel, augmented reality-based training simulator (Eyesi Indirect, VRmagic Holding AG, Mannheim, Germany) was integrated into the teaching at the University Eye Hospital Ulm. During the block week, two key questions were examined: Does the one week block lesson increase interest in ophthalmology? How do students assess the use of an innovative e-learning technology compared to three other classical teaching methods for learning ophthalmoscopy? Material/Methods As part of the student teaching (block weeks July and October 2016), 292 students were questioned by questionnaire anonymously and on a voluntary basis regarding their assessment of the block week and the training simulator at the beginning and end of the one week event. The ophthalmoscopies were classically practiced on the ophthalmoscope trainer, head model and on fellow students and then performed on the new training simulator. Results Overall, there was little interest among the students in ophthalmology. However, the block week helped to increase interest (p < 0.001). The assessments of attractiveness before and after the block week of ophthalmology as a later professional goal and as an optional subject in the practical year were also significantly increased (p < 0.001 or p = 0.031). With regard to the use of e-learning technologies, it was shown that the handling of the simulator for learning ophthalmoscopy was rated more attractive by the students than the classical technology-based teaching methods (all p < 0.01). The joy of learning could only be further increased by practicing on a fellow student (p = 0.051). Conclusion The results of the present study show a positive impact of the block week on the attractiveness assessment of the specialty by the participating students. Innovative e-learning methods can increase the enjoyment of learning. However, the training simulator cannot provide a complete replacement of the training on a real person.

A new age of mass casuality education?: The InSitu project: realistic training in virtual reality environments. [German],"Lorenz, D.; Armbruster, W.; Vogelgesang, C.; Hoffmann, H.; Pattar, A.; Schmidt, D.; Volk, T.; Kubulus, D.","Background: Chief emergency physicians are regarded as an important element in the care of the injured and sick following mass casualty accidents. Their education is very theoretical; practical content in contrast often falls short. Limitations are usually the very high costs of realistic (large-scale) exercises, poor reproducibility of the scenarios, and poor corresponding results. Objective(s): To substantially improve the educational level because of the complexity of mass casualty accidents, modified training concepts are required that teach the not only the theoretical but above all the practical skills considerably more intensively than at present. Modern training concepts should make it possible for the learner to realistically simulate decision processes. This article examines how interactive virtual environments are applicable for the education of emergency personnel and how they could be designed. Material(s) and Method(s): Virtual simulation and training environments offer the possibility of simulating complex situations in an adequately realistic manner. The so-called virtual reality (VR) used in this context is an interface technology that enables free interaction in addition to a stereoscopic and spatial representation of virtual large-scale emergencies in a virtual environment. Variables in scenarios such as the weather, the number wounded, and the availability of resources, can be changed at any time. The trainees are able to practice the procedures in many virtual accident scenes and act them out repeatedly, thereby testing the different variants. Result(s): With the aid of the ""InSitu"" project, it is possible to train in a virtual reality with realistically reproduced accident situations. These integrated, interactive training environments can depict very complex situations on a scale of 1:1. Because of the highly developed interactivity, the trainees can feel as if they are a direct part of the accident scene and therefore identify much more with the virtual world than is possible with desktop systems. Conclusion(s): Interactive, identifiable, and realistic training environments based on projector systems could in future enable a repetitive exercise with changes within a decision tree, in reproducibility, and within different occupational groups. With a hard- and software environment numerous accident situations can be depicted and practiced. The main expense is the creation of the virtual accident scenes. As the appropriate city models and other three-dimensional geographical data are already available, this expenditure is very low compared with the planning costs of a large-scale exercise.

Exploring the Potential of Undergraduate Radiology Education in the Virtual World Second Life with First-cycle and Second-cycle Medical Students,"Lorenzo-Alvarez, R.; Pavia-Molina, J.; Sendra-Portero, F.","Rationale and Objectives: Virtual worlds have a remarkable potential for effective teaching and learning, providing immersive, realistic, and engaging online events. Previous studies have explored online education of health professionals in Second Life (SL), the most widely used virtual world, but none of the previous learning experiences were related to radiology. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential use of SL for undergraduate radiology education and the involvement of students in SL learning activities. Material(s) and Method(s): We delivered a 4-week voluntary undergraduate radiology education program in SL, based on synchronous sessions and asynchronous tasks, with two modalities: introduction to basic radiology for first-cycle (first- to third-year) students and case-based clinical radiology for second-cycle (fourth- to sixth-year) students. Participants completed an evaluation questionnaire about the experiences after the learning program. Result(s): Forty-six students (20 first-cycle and 26 second-cycle) participated in this study. They found the contents of the course appropriate (mean >= 4.53/5), the initiative interesting, and the environment attractive (mean >= 4.32/5), and they were willing to participate in future SL experiences (mean >= 4.63/5). All students highly rated the organization, the content, the benefit to their medical education, and the professor (mean >= 9.05/10). Conclusion(s): Online radiology education using SL is feasible and well received by medical students of all year groups. The students participated and engaged in this activity very positively and rated the experience highly. The potential of using SL for radiology education includes promising expectations regarding collaborative learning and gamification.

Medical student education for abdominal radiographs in a 3D virtual classroom versus traditional classroom: A randomized controlled trial,"Lorenzo-Alvarez, R.; Rudolphi-Solero, T.; Ruiz-Gomez, M. J.; Sendra-Portero, F.","OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to compare the effectiveness of practical radiology learning by medical students in a 3D virtual world versus the real world. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Two hundred fifteen 3rd-year medical students were randomized into two groups to attend the same workshop on abdominal radiography interpretation in a virtual world classroom (VW group) and in real life (RL group). Pre- and posttraining knowledge tests consisting of 12 multiple choice questions were performed at the beginning of the workshop and 2 months later. RESULTS. Fifty-four of 107 and five of 108 students refused to attend their respective group, resulting in the participation of 53 students (VW group) and 103 students (RL group) in this study. No significant differences were found between groups in the tests taken before (VW group, mean [+/- SD], 4.5 +/- 1.8 points; RL group, 4.0 +/- 1.3 points) and after (VW group, 6.2 +/- 1.2; RL group, 6.0 +/- 1.7 points) training. CONCLUSION. Radiology education in a 3D virtual classroom fosters participatory learning and results in similar acquisition of interpretive skills as a traditional face-to-face classroom. Virtual worlds allow the performance of online activities to learn interpretive skills with guaranteed success in learning similar to that of conventional activities. Additionally, the relative lack of identity in the virtual workshops makes students less afraid to speak and more participatory. Copyright © 2019 American Roentgen Ray Society.

Merged virtual reality teaching of the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery: a randomized controlled trial,"Lowry, B.; Johnson, G. G. R. J.; Vergis, A.","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic challenges our ability to provide surgical education, as our ability to gather and train together has been restricted due to safety concerns. However, the importance of quality surgical education has remained. High-fidelity simulation platforms have been developed that merge virtual reality video streams to allow for remote instruction and collaboration. This study sought to validate the use of a merged virtual reality (MVR) platform for the instruction and assessment of the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) skills. Method(s): This was a prospective randomized controlled non-inferiority study. Thirty participants were randomized between three groups: The standard group received in-person instruction and expert feedback, the experimental group received identical training via the MVR platform, and the control group practiced on their own, but received no feedback. All participants were pre-tested for baseline performance at the beginning of the study. Change in performance was evaluated immediately after training and one month later for retention. Ordinary one-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effects of time, group, and time-on-group. Result(s): The pre-test confirmed baseline homogeneity between the groups. MVR was non-inferior to standard in-person training for total FLS times on either the post-test (p = 0.632) or the retention test (p = 0.829). Performance was also identical between MVR and standard training groups for each of the individual FLS tasks. Each group improved significantly in nearly all tasks after practice; however, the standard and MVR training groups both improved significantly more than controls for the ligating loop, extracorporeal suturing, intracorporeal suturing, and total FLS task training but did not reach statistical significance for peg transfer and pattern cut tasks. Conclusion(s): This randomized, controlled trial has demonstrated the use of an MVR platform as non-inferior to in-person instruction for the FLS program, forming the foundation for future work on remote instruction and collaboration.

Innovative Educational Pathways in Spine Surgery: Advanced Virtual Reality-Based Training,"Luca, A.; Giorgino, R.; Gesualdo, L.; Peretti, G. M.; Belkhou, A.; Banfi, G.; Grasso, G.","Background: Over the past few years, a reorganization of the educational pathways has been promoted with the purpose of optimizing the acquisition of competences and their assessment, so as to reduce the risks to both health care professionals and end users. Virtual reality (VR) has been repeatedly tested, initially as a positive reinforcement for more traditional educational pathways and, more recently, as their potential substitute. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potentiality of VR simulation training in spine surgery. Method(s): The VR simulator reproduced the lateral lumbar access to the spine. The simulation included a tutorial, the preoperative settings, and the surgical session with different levels of procedural complexity. A total of 10 users were recruited for this study: 3 senior surgeons (group A) and 7 orthopedic residents or junior orthopedic surgeons (group B). Each user completed the simulation twice. Result(s): The user's age or previous experience with VR technology did not show any relevance. On average, the entire simulation was completed in 24'36'. Group B showed an improvement between the 2 attempts in both sessions, the preoperative settings and the surgical simulation. The number of major errors dropped from an average of 5.2 to 1.8 and from an average of 4 (maximum 6-minimum 1) to 1.4, respectively. The simulation was never interrupted because of technical bugs or adverse effects related to the technology. Conclusion(s): VR-based training pathways might promote a high standard of care. Our preliminary experience suggests an effective implementation of the traditional coaching process.

Personalized augmented reality for anatomy education,"Ma, M.; Fallavollita, P.; Seelbach, I.; Von Der Heide, A. M.; Euler, E.; Waschke, J.; Navab, N.","Anatomy education is a challenging but vital element in forming future medical professionals. In this work, a personalized and interactive augmented reality system is developed to facilitate education. This system behaves as a ""magic mirror"" which allows personalized in-situ visualization of anatomy on the user's body. Real-time volume visualization of a CT dataset creates the illusion that the user can look inside their body. The system comprises a RGB-D sensor as a real-time tracking device to detect the user moving in front of a display. In addition, the magic mirror system shows text information, medical images, and 3D models of organs that the user can interact with. Through the participation of 7 clinicians and 72 students, two user studies were designed to respectively assess the precision and acceptability of the magic mirror system for education. The results of the first study demonstrated that the average precision of the augmented reality overlay on the user body was 0.96 cm, while the results of the second study indicate 86.1% approval for the educational value of the magic mirror, and 91.7% approval for the augmented reality capability of displaying organs in three dimensions.

Master and Apprentice or a Slave to Technology? A Randomized Controlled Trial of Minimal Access Surgery Simulation-Based Training Techniques,"MacArthur-Beadle, I.; Nair, D. V. K.; Cook, N. J.; Yi, M.; Jones, R.; Beasley, S. W.; Wells, J. M.","Introduction: This study set out to assess the efficacy of three different approaches to simulation-based minimal access surgery (MAS) training using a three-dimensional printed neonatal thoracoscopic simulator and a virtual simulator. Material(s) and Method(s): Randomized controlled trial of medical students (N = 32), as novices to MAS. The participants performed two construct validated tasks on a thoracoscopic simulator and were then randomly allocated into four intervention groups: (1) three consultant-led sessions on a thoracoscopic simulator; (2) three self-directed learning sessions on the same simulator; (3) self-directed ""virtual training""on the ""SimuSurg""application; and (4) control. Postintervention participants repeated both tasks. Videos of all task attempts were de-identified and marked by a blinded consultant pediatric surgeon. Result(s): There were no statistically significant differences in baseline objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) scores or demographics in any group. For the ""ring transfer""task, Groups 1 and 2 showed significant improvement after intervention, with no significant change in Groups 3 or 4. There was no significant difference between Groups 1 or 2 in postintervention scores. For the ""needle pass""task, no group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement after intervention. Conclusion(s): Practice on a physical simulator either consultant-led or self-directed led to improved scores for MAS novices compared with a virtual simulator or no intervention for a simple ""ring transfer""task. This suggests that time on the physical simulator was the most important factor and implies that trainees could usefully practice simple tasks at their convenience rather than require consultant supervision. This improvement is not seen in more challenging tasks such as the ""needle pass. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",2020,December,Journal of Laparoendoscopic and Advanced Surgical Techniques,30(12),,1263-1271,633688088,,,#3170,MacArthur-Beadle 2020,,
High-fidelity simulation and virtual reality: An evaluation of medical students' experiences,"Macnamara, A. F.; Bird, K.; Rigby, A.; Sathyapalan, T.; Hepburn, D.","Background Simulation technology is widely used in medical education, providing an environment in which students can develop and practise a multitude of skills that are relevant to clinical practice, without the risk of harm to patients. Methods We conducted a mixed methods cross-over study with quantitative and qualitative outcomes. This analysed students' perceptions of two simulation technologies: a high-fidelity patient simulator and virtual reality. Twenty final year medical students completed a questionnaire after having experienced both simulation modalities. Results Students scored the patient simulator higher in domains such as developing team working and'ABCDE assessment skills', whereas the virtual reality simulation was more immersive and fun. Participants found the patient simulator more useful in preparing them for clinical practice. Conclusion Medical students in this study expressed that a high-fidelity patient simulator, in a simulated clinical environment, was of greater value to their preparation for clinical practice than virtual reality simulation of a similar environment. However, the virtual reality simulation offered a near comparable experience, and was found to be was enjoyable, immersive and easily portable. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Introducing a virtual reality experience in anatomic pathology education,"Madrigal, E.; Prajapati, S.; Hernandez-Prera, J. C.","Objectives: A proper examination of surgical specimens is fundamental in anatomic pathology (AP) education. However, the resources available to residents may not always be suitable for efficient skill acquisition. We propose a method to enhance AP education by introducing high-definition videos featuring methods for appropriate specimen handling, viewable on two-dimensional (2D) and stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) platforms. Method(s): A stereo camera system recorded the gross processing of commonly encountered specimens. Three edited videos, with instructional audio voiceovers, were experienced by nine junior residents in a crossover study to assess the effects of the exposure (2D vs 3D movie views) on self-reported physiologic symptoms. A questionnaire was used to analyze viewer acceptance. Result(s): All surveyed residents found the videos beneficial in preparation to examine a new specimen type. Viewer data suggest an improvement in specimen handling confidence and knowledge and enthusiasm toward 3D technology. None of the participants encountered significant motion sickness. Conclusion(s): Our novel method provides the foundation to create a robust teaching library. AP is inherently a visual discipline, and by building on the strengths of traditional teaching methods, our dynamic approach allows viewers to appreciate the procedural actions involved in specimen processing.

The Predictive Value of Ultrasound Learning Curves Across Simulated and Clinical Settings,"Madsen, M. E.; Norgaard, L. N.; Tabor, A.; Konge, L.; Ringsted, C.; Tolsgaard, M. G.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to explore whether learning curves on a virtual-reality (VR) sonographic simulator can be used to predict subsequent learning curves on a physical mannequin and learning curves during clinical training. METHODS: Twenty midwives completed a simulation-based training program in transvaginal sonography. The training was conducted on a VR simulator as well as on a physical mannequin. A subgroup of 6 participants underwent subsequent clinical training. During each of the 3 steps, the participants' performance was assessed using instruments with established validity evidence, and they advanced to the next level only after attaining predefined levels of performance. The number of repetitions and time needed to achieve predefined performance levels were recorded along with the performance scores in each setting. Finally, the outcomes were correlated across settings. RESULTS: A good correlation was found between time needed to achieve predefined performance levels on the VR simulator and the physical mannequin (Pearson correlation coefficient .78; P<.001). Performance scores on the VR simulator correlated well to the clinical performance scores (Pearson correlation coefficient .81; P=.049). No significant correlations were found between numbers of attempts needed to reach proficiency across the 3 different settings. A post hoc analysis found that the 50% fastest trainees at reaching proficiency during simulation-based training received higher clinical performance scores compared to trainees with scores placing them among the 50% slowest (P=.025). CONCLUSIONS: Performances during simulation-based sonography training may predict performance in related tasks and subsequent clinical learning curves.

International Mixed Reality Immersive Experience: Approach via Surgical Grand Rounds,"Mahajan, A. P.; Inniss, D. A.; Benedict, M. D.; Dennis, A. A.; Kantor, T.; Salavitabar, A.; Stegink, C.; Nelson, J.; Kinross, J.; Cohen, M. S.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 created unintended but significant experiential barriers for surgical learners to interact at the bedside for teaching/case presentations. We hypothesized that an international grand rounds using the Microsoft HoloLens 2 extended reality (XR) headset would create an improved bedside-learning experience compared to traditional grand rounds formats. STUDY DESIGN: From December 2020 to March 2021, the world's first 2 international mixed reality grand rounds events using the HoloLens 2 headset were held, broadcasting transatlantically (between the University of Michigan and the Imperial College of London) bedside rounding experiences on 5 complex surgical patients to an international audience of 325 faculty, residents, and medical trainees. Participants completed pre- and post-event surveys to assess their experience. RESULT(S): Of the 325 participants, 267 (80%) completed pre-surveys, and 95 (29%) completed both the pre- and post-surveys. Respondents (average age, 38 y; 44% women, 56% men; 211 US, 56 UK) included 92 (34%) medical students and residents and 175 faculty and staff. In the pre-event survey, 76% had little or no earlier experience with XR devices, and 94% thought implementation of XR into medical curricula was valuable. In the post-survey, 96% thought telerounding using XR technology was important for the current era, and 99% thought the ability to visualize the examination, imaging, and laboratory results at bedside via XR rounding was highly valuable and that this format was superior to traditional grand rounds. CONCLUSION(S): Almost all of the participants in the mixed reality international grand rounds felt the immersive XR experiences-allowing visualization of clinical findings, imaging, and laboratory results at the patient's bedside-were superior to a traditional grand rounds format, and that it could be a valuable tool for surgical teaching and telerounding.

Virtual reality simulation in endoscopy training: Current evidence and future directions,"Mahmood, T.; Scaffidi, M. A.; Khan, R.; Grover, S. C.","Virtual reality simulation is becoming the standard when beginning endoscopic training. It offers various benefits including learning in a low-stakes environment, improvement of patient safety and optimization of valuable endoscopy time. This is a review of the evidence surrounding virtual reality simulation and its efficacy in teaching endoscopic techniques. There have been 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have investigated virtual reality simulation as a teaching tool in endoscopy. 10 RCTs studied virtual reality in colonoscopy, 3 in flexible sigmoidoscopy, 5 in esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and 3 in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. RCTs reported many outcomes including distance advanced in colonoscopy, comprehensive assessment of technical and non-technical skills, and patient comfort. Generally, these RCTs reveal that trainees with virtual reality simulation based learning improve in all of these areas in the beginning of the learning process. Virtual reality simulation was not effective as a replacement of conventional teaching methods. Additionally, feedback was shown to be an essential part of the learning process. Overall, virtual reality endoscopic simulation is emerging as a necessary augment to conventional learning given the ever increasing importance of patient safety and increasingly valuable endoscopy time; although work is still needed to study the nuances surrounding its integration into curriculum.

Developing a Conversational Virtual Standardized Patient to Enable Students to Practice History-Taking Skills,"Maicher, K.; Danforth, D.; Price, A.; Zimmerman, L.; Wilcox, B.; Liston, B.; Cronau, H.; Belknap, L.; Ledford, C.; Way, D.; Post, D.; Macerollo, A.; Rizer, M.","INTRODUCTION: Although traditional virtual patient simulations are designed to teach and assess clinical reasoning skills, few employ conversational dialogue with the patients. The virtual standardized patients (VSPs) described herein represent standardized patients that students interview using natural language. Students take histories and develop differential diagnoses of the VSPs as much as they would with standardized or actual patients. The student-VSP interactions are recorded, creating a comprehensive record of questions and the order in which they were asked, which can be analyzed to assess information-gathering skills. Students document the encounter in an electronic medical record created for the VSPs. METHODS: The VSP was developed by integrating a dialogue management system (ChatScript) with emotionally responsive 3D characters created in a high-fidelity game engine (Unity). The system was tested with medical students at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. Students are able to take a history of a VSP, develop a differential diagnosis, and document the encounter in the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Accuracy of the VSP responses ranged from 79% to 86%, depending on the complexity of the case, type of history obtained, and skill of the student. Students were able to accurately develop an appropriate differential diagnosis on the basis of the information provided by the patient during the encounter. CONCLUSIONS: The VSP enables students to practice their history-taking skills before encounters with standardized or actual patients. Future developments will focus on creating an assessment module that will automatically analyze VSP sessions and provide immediate student feedback.",2017,1-Apr,Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,12(2),,124-131,621890198,,,#3201,Maicher 2017,,
Simulation based virtual learning environment in medical genetics counseling: an example of bridging the gap between theory and practice in medical education,"Makransky, G.; Bonde, M. T.; Wulff, J. S.; Wandall, J.; Hood, M.; Creed, P. A.; Bache, I.; Silahtaroglu, A.; Norremolle, A.","BACKGROUND: Simulation based learning environments are designed to improve the quality of medical education by allowing students to interact with patients, diagnostic laboratory procedures, and patient data in a virtual environment. However, few studies have evaluated whether simulation based learning environments increase students' knowledge, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy, and help them generalize from laboratory analyses to clinical practice and health decision-making. METHODS: An entire class of 300 University of Copenhagen first-year undergraduate students, most with a major in medicine, received a 2-h training session in a simulation based learning environment. The main outcomes were pre- to post- changes in knowledge, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy, together with post-intervention evaluation of the effect of the simulation on student understanding of everyday clinical practice were demonstrated. RESULTS: Knowledge (Cohen's d=0.73), intrinsic motivation (d=0.24), and self-efficacy (d=0.46) significantly increased from the pre- to post-test. Low knowledge students showed the greatest increases in knowledge (d=3.35) and self-efficacy (d=0.61), but a non-significant increase in intrinsic motivation (d=0.22). The medium and high knowledge students showed significant increases in knowledge (d=1.45 and 0.36, respectively), motivation (d=0.22 and 0.31), and self-efficacy (d=0.36 and 0.52, respectively). Additionally, 90 % of students reported a greater understanding of medical genetics, 82 % thought that medical genetics was more interesting, 93 % indicated that they were more interested and motivated, and had gained confidence by having experienced working on a case story that resembled the real working situation of a doctor, and 78 % indicated that they would feel more confident counseling a patient after the simulation. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation based learning environment increased students' learning, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy (although the strength of these effects differed depending on their pre-test knowledge), and increased the perceived relevance of medical educational activities. The results suggest that simulations can help future generations of doctors transfer new understanding of disease mechanisms gained in virtual laboratory settings into everyday clinical practice.",2016,25-Mar,BMC medical education,16,,98,616243679,,,#3214,Makransky 2016,,
Exploring the Role of Virtual Reality to Support Clinical Diabetes Training-A Pilot Study,"Mallik, R.; Patel, M.; Atkinson, B.; Kar, P.","Background: It is estimated that 16 to 25% of patients in hospital have diabetes and 1 in 25 inpatients with Type 1 Diabetes develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). It is vital that non-specialist doctors recognize and appropriately manage diabetes emergencies. Simulation training is increasingly being used in healthcare and virtual reality (VR) based educational resources is transforming medical education. This study aimed to evaluate the use of virtual reality to help non-specialist clinicians manage clinical scenarios related to diabetes. Method(s): This pilot project, titled 'DEVICE' (Diabetes Emergencies: Virtual Interactive Clinical Education) was developed in collaboration with Oxford Medical Simulation. Fully interactive immersive VR scenarios were created to stimulate real life diabetes emergencies. Users then received personalized feedback and performance metrics. Feedback surveys were provided before and after the participation in the VR scenario. Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model was used. Result(s): Thirty-nine participants from 2 hospitals in UK provided feedback up to 3 months after attending the VR education sessions. Overall feedback was extremely positive, and participants found this immersive teaching experience very helpful. After use of virtual reality scenarios, the mean trainee confidence in managing DKA (on an 8-point Likert scale) increased from 3.92 (3.38-4.47) 95% CI to 5.41 (4.79-6.03) 95% CI (statistically significant). The VR study demonstrates Kirkpatrick level 3 in the follow up survey. Conclusion(s): VR based training scenarios in this pilot project increased confidence in managing diabetes emergencies and demonstrated positive changes in their behavior.

Virtual Reality Simulator Systems in Robotic Surgical Training,"Mangano, A.; Gheza, F.; Giulianotti, P. C.","The number of robotic surgical procedures has been increasing worldwide. It is important to maximize the cost-effectiveness of robotic surgical training and safely reduce the time needed for trainees to reach proficiency. The use of preliminary lab training in robotic skills is a good strategy for the rapid acquisition of further, standardized robotic skills. Such training can be done either by using a simulator or by exercises in a dry or wet lab. While the use of an actual robotic surgical system for training may be problematic (high cost, lack of availability), virtual reality (VR) simulators can overcome many of these obstacles. However, there is still a lack of standardization. Although VR training systems have improved, they cannot yet replace experience in a wet lab. In particular, simulated scenarios are not yet close enough to a real operative experience. Indeed, there is a difference between technical skills (i.e., mechanical ability to perform a simulated task) and surgical competence (i.e., ability to perform a real surgical operation). Thus, while a VR simulator can replace a dry lab, it cannot yet replace training in a wet lab or operative training in actual patients. However, in the near future, it is expected that VR surgical simulators will be able to provide total reality simulation and replace training in a wet lab. More research is needed to produce more wide-ranging, trans-specialty robotic curricula.",2018,1-Jun,Surgical technology international,32,,19-23,624505582,,,#3239,Mangano 2018,,

"Virtual reality and cardiac anatomy: Exploring immersive three-dimensional cardiac imaging, a pilot study in undergraduate medical anatomy education","Maresky, H. S.; Oikonomou, A.; Ali, I.; Ditkofsky, N.; Pakkal, M.; Ballyk, B.","Cardiac anatomy can be challenging to grasp because of its complex three-dimensional nature and remains one of the most challenging topics to teach. In light of some exciting technological advances in the field of virtual reality (VR), we sought to test the viability and the assess efficacy of this computer-generated model for the purposes of teaching cardiac anatomy. Before learning cardiac anatomy, first-year undergraduate medical students participated in an anatomically correct VR simulation of the heart. Students were randomly distributed into control and variable groups. Each student completed a pre-intervention quiz, consisting of 10 multiple choice questions with 5 conventional cardiac anatomy questions and 5 visual-spatial (VS) questions. The control group continued to independent study, whereas the variable group subjects were exposed to a 30-min immersive cardiac VR experience. At the end of the intervention, both the groups underwent a separate post-intervention 10-question quiz. Forty-two students participated in the cardiac VR experiment, separated into 14 control and 28 variable subjects. They scored 50.9% on average on the pre-intervention quiz (SD = 16.5) and 70.2% on the post-intervention quiz (SD = 18.7). Compared to the control group, the students exposed to VR scored 21.4% higher in conventional content (P = 0.004), 26.4% higher in VS content (P < 0.001), and 23.9% higher overall (P < 0.001). VR offers an anatomically correct and immersive VS environment that permits learner to interact three-dimensionally with the heart's anatomy.

Demonstrating the effectiveness of the fundamentals of robotic surgery (FRS) curriculum on the RobotiX Mentor Virtual Reality Simulation Platform,"Martin, J. R.; Stefanidis, D.; Dorin, R. P.; Goh, A. C.; Satava, R. M.; Levy, J. S.","Fundamentals of robotic surgery (FRS) is a proficiency-based progression curriculum developed by robotic surgery experts from multiple specialty areas to address gaps in existing robotic surgery training curricula. The RobotiX Mentor is a virtual reality training platform for robotic surgery. Our aims were to determine if robotic surgery novices would demonstrate improved technical skills after completing FRS training on the RobotiX Mentor, and to compare the effectiveness of FRS across training platforms. An observational, pre-post design, multi-institutional rater-blinded trial was conducted at two American College of Surgeons Accredited Education Institutes-certified simulation centers. Robotic surgery novices (n = 20) were enrolled and trained to expert-derived benchmarks using FRS on the RobotiX Mentor. Participants' baseline skill was assessed before (pre-test) and after (post-test) training on an avian tissue model. Tests were video recorded and graded by blinded raters using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) and a 32-criteria psychomotor checklist. Post hoc comparisons were conducted against previously published comparator groups. On paired-samples T tests, participants demonstrated improved performance across all GEARS domains (p < 0.001 to p = 0.01) and for time (p < 0.001) and errors (p = 0.003) as measured by psychometric checklist. By ANOVA, improvement in novices' skill after FRS training on the RobotiX Mentor was not inferior to improvement reported after FRS training on previously published platforms. Completion of FRS on the RobotiX Mentor resulted in improved robotic surgery skills among novices, proving effectiveness of training.

Comparison of Three Virtual Reality Arthroscopic Simulators as Part of an Orthopedic Residency Educational Curriculum,"Martin, K. D.; Akoh, C. C.; Amendola, A.; Phisitkul, P.","PURPOSE: Orthopedic education continues to move towards evidence-based curriculum in order to comply with new residency accreditation mandates. There are currently three high fidelity arthroscopic virtual reality (VR) simulators available, each with multiple instructional modules and simulated arthroscopic procedures. The aim of the current study is to assess face validity, defined as the degree to which a procedure appears effective in terms of its stated aims, of three available VR simulators. METHODS: Thirty subjects were recruited from a single orthopedic residency training program. Each subject completed one training session on each of the three leading VR arthroscopic simulators (ARTHRO mentor-Symbionix, ArthroS-Virtamed, and ArthroSim-Toltech). Each arthroscopic session involved simulator-specific modules. After training sessions, subjects completed a previously validated simulator questionnaire for face validity. RESULTS: The median external appearances for the ARTHRO Mentor (9.3, range 6.7-10.0; p=0.0036) and ArthroS (9.3, range 7.3-10.0; p=0.0003) were statistically higher than for Arthro- Sim (6.7, range 3.3-9.7). There was no statistical difference in intraarticular appearance, instrument appearance, or user friendliness between the three groups. Most simulators reached an appropriate level of proportion of sufficient scores for each categor y (>=70%), except for ARTHRO Mentor (intraarticular appearance-50%; instrument appearance- 61.1%) and ArthroSim (external appearance- 50%; user friendliness-68.8%). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that ArthroS has the highest overall face validity of the three current arthroscopic VR simulators. However, only external appearance for ArthroS reached statistical significance when compared to the other simulators. Additionally, each simulator had satisfactory intraarticular quality. This study helps further the understanding of VR simulation and necessary features for accurate arthroscopic representation.

Arthroscopic Training Courses Improve Trainee Arthroscopy Skills: A Simulation-Based Prospective Trial,"Martin, K. D.; Patterson, D. P.; Cameron, K. L.","Purpose To evaluate the correlation between timed task performance on an arthroscopy shoulder simulator and participation in a standardized expert shoulder arthroscopy educational course. Methods Orthopaedic trainees were voluntarily recruited from over 25 residency programs throughout the United States and Canada. Each trainee was tested on arrival at the Arthroscopy Association of North America orthopaedic learning center on a virtual reality arthroscopy shoulder simulator, and his or her performance was objectively scored. Each trainee's postgraduate year level was recorded, as was his or her experience in residency with shoulder arthroscopy as measured by Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case-log totals. After the focused 4-day training curriculum consisting of didactics and cadaveric experience, each trainee was re-evaluated on the same simulator. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if participation in the course was associated with changes in simulation performance from before to after assessment. Results Forty-eight trainees completed the testing. On completion of the course, trainees showed significant improvements in all objective measures recorded by the simulator. Total probe distance needed to complete the task decreased by 42% (from 420.4 mm to 245.3 mm, P <.001), arthroscope tip distance traveled decreased by 59% (from 194.1 mm to 80.2 mm, P <.001), and time to completion decreased by 38% (from 66.8 seconds to 41.6 seconds, P <.001). Highly significant improvements in all 3 measures suggest improved instrument handling, anatomic recognition, and arthroscopy-related visual-spatial ability. Conclusions This study shows objective improvement in orthopaedic trainee basic arthroscopy skill and proficiency after a standardized 4-day arthroscopy training curriculum. The results validate the Arthroscopy Association of North America resident training course and its curriculum with objective evidence of benefit.

Low-cost endoscopy box trainers (BTs) could democratize training; however, their effectiveness has never been compared with higher-cost virtual reality simulators (VRSs). STUDY DESIGN: In this randomized noninferiority trial, endoscopy novices trained either on the VRS used in the Fundamental of Endoscopic Surgery manual skills (FESms) exam or a validated BT-the Basic Endoscopic Skills Training (BEST) box. Trainees were tested at fixed timepoints on the FESms and on standardized ex vivo models. The primary endpoint was FESms improvement at 1 week. Secondary endpoints were FESms improvement at 2 weeks, FESms pass rates, ex vivo tests performance, and trainees' feedback. RESULT(S): Seventy-seven trainees completed the study. VRS and BT trainees showed comparable FESms improvements (25.16 +/- 14.29 vs 25.58 +/- 11.75 FESms points, respectively; p = 0.89), FESms pass rates (76.32% vs 61.54%, respectively; p = 0.16) and total ex vivo tasks completion times (365.76 +/- 237.56 vs 322.68 +/- 186.04 seconds, respectively; p = 0.55) after 1 week.

Trainees were significantly more satisfied with the BT platform (3.97 +/- 1.20 vs 4.81 +/- 0.40 points on a 5-point Likert scale for the VRS and the BT, respectively; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Simulation-based training is an effective means to develop competency in endoscopy, especially at the beginning of the learning curve. Low-cost BTs like the BEST box compare well with high-tech VRSs and could help democratize endoscopy training. Copyright © 2022 by the American College of Surgeons.

A validation study of intraoperative performance metrics for training novice cardiac resynchronization therapy implanters,"Mascheroni, J.; Mont, L.; Stockburger, M.; Patwala, A.; Retzlaff, H.; Gallagher, A. G.","Aims: Pacing/cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implant training currently lacks a common system to objectively assess trainee ability to perform required tasks at predetermined performance levels. The purpose of this study was to primarily examine construct validity and reliability, secondarily discriminative validity of novel intraoperative performance metrics, developed for a reference approach to training novice CRT implanters. Method(s): Fifteen novice and eleven experienced CRT implanters performed a 3-lead implant procedure on a virtual reality simulator. Performances were video-recorded, then independently scored using predefined metrics endorsed by an international panel of experts. First, Novice and Experienced group scores were compared for steps completed and errors made. Secondly, each group was split in two around the median score of the group and subgroup scores were compared. Result(s): The mean number of scored metrics per performance was 108 and the inter-rater reliability for scoring was 0.947. Compared with novices, experienced implanters completed more procedural Steps correctly (mean 87% vs. 73%, p = 0.001), made fewer procedural Errors (6.3 vs. 11.2, p = 0.005), Critical Errors (1.8 vs. 4.4, p = 0.004), and total errors (8.1 vs. 15.6, p = 0.002). Furthermore, the differences between the two Novice subgroups were 25% for steps completed correctly and 94% for total errors made (p < 0.001); the differences between the two Experienced subgroups were respectively 16% and 191% (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The procedure metrics used in this study reliably distinguish novice and experienced CRT implanters' performances. The metrics further differentiated performance levels within a group with similar experience. These performance metrics will underpin quality-assured novice implanter training.

Is virtual reality effective to teach prevention of surgical site infections in the operating room? study protocol for a randomised controlled multicentre trial entitled VIP Room study,"Masson, C.; Birgand, G.; Castro-Sanchez, E.; Eichel, V. M.; Comte, A.; Terrisse, H.; Rubens-Duval, B.; Gillois, P.; Albaladejo, P.; Picard, J.; Bosson, J. L.; Mutters, N. T.; Landelle, C.","Introduction Some surgical site infections (SSI) could be prevented by following adequate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. Poor compliance with IPC measures often occurs due to knowledge gaps and insufficient education of healthcare professionals. The education and training of SSI preventive measures does not usually take place in the operating room (OR), due to safety, and organisational and logistic issues. The proposed study aims to compare virtual reality (VR) as a tool for medical students to learn the SSI prevention measures and adequate behaviours (eg, limit movements...) in the OR, to conventional teaching. Methods and analysis This protocol describes a randomised controlled multicentre trial comparing an educational intervention based on VR simulation to routine education. This multicentre study will be performed in three universities: Grenoble Alpes University (France), Imperial College London (UK) and University of Heidelberg (Germany). Third-year medical students of each university will be randomised in two groups. The students randomised in the intervention group will follow VR teaching. The students randomised in the control group will follow a conventional education programme. Primary outcome will be the difference between scores obtained at the IPC exam at the end of the year between the two groups. The written exam will be the same in the three countries. Secondary outcomes will be satisfaction and students' progression for the VR group. The data will be analysed with intention-to-treat and per protocol.

Predictors of laparoscopic simulation performance among practicing obstetrician gynecologists,"Mathews, S.; Brodman, M.; D'Angelo, D.; Chudnoff, S.; McGovern, P.; Kolev, T.; Bensinger, G.; Mudiraj, S.; Nemes, A.; Feldman, D.; Kischak, P.; Ascher-Walsh, C.","Background While simulation training has been established as an effective method for improving laparoscopic surgical performance in surgical residents, few studies have focused on its use for attending surgeons, particularly in obstetrics and gynecology. Surgical simulation may have a role in improving and maintaining proficiency in the operating room for practicing obstetrician gynecologists. Objective We sought to determine if parameters of performance for validated laparoscopic virtual simulation tasks correlate with surgical volume and characteristics of practicing obstetricians and gynecologists. Study Design All gynecologists with laparoscopic privileges (n = 347) from 5 academic medical centers in New York City were required to complete a laparoscopic surgery simulation assessment. The physicians took a presimulation survey gathering physician self-reported characteristics and then performed 3 basic skills tasks (enforced peg transfer, lifting/grasping, and cutting) on the LapSim virtual reality laparoscopic simulator (Surgical Science Ltd, Gothenburg, Sweden). The association between simulation outcome scores (time, efficiency, and errors) and self-rated clinical skills measures (self-rated laparoscopic skill score or surgical volume category) were examined with regression models. Results The average number of laparoscopic procedures per month was a significant predictor of total time on all 3 tasks (P =.001 for peg transfer; P =.041 for lifting and grasping; P <.001 for cutting). Average monthly laparoscopic surgical volume was a significant predictor of 2 efficiency scores in peg transfer, and all 4 efficiency scores in cutting (P =.001 to P =.015). Surgical volume was a significant predictor of errors in lifting/grasping and cutting (P <.001 for both). Self-rated laparoscopic skill level was a significant predictor of total time in all 3 tasks (P <.0001 for peg transfer; P =.009 for lifting and grasping; P <.001 for cutting) and a significant predictor of nearly all efficiency scores and errors scores in all 3 tasks. Conclusion In addition to total time, there was at least 1 other objective performance measure that significantly correlated with surgical volume for each of the 3 tasks. Higher-volume physicians and those with fellowship training were more confident in their laparoscopic skills. By determining simulation performance as it correlates to active physician practice, further studies may help assess skill and individualize training to maintain skill levels as case volumes fluctuate.

Development and assessment of an educational application for the proper use of ceiling-suspended radiation shielding screens in angiography rooms using augmented reality technology,"Matsuzaki, S.; Moritake, T.; Morota, K.; Nagamoto, K.; Nakagami, K.; Kuriyama, T.; Kunugita, N.","Purpose: An augmented reality (AR) application to help medical staff involved in interventional radiology (IR) learn how to properly use ceiling-suspended radiation shielding screens was created, and its utility was tested from the perspective of learner motivation. Method(s): The distribution of scattered radiation in an angiography room was visualized with an AR application in three settings: when a ceiling-suspended radiation shielding screen is not used (incorrect); when there is a gap between the bottom edge of the shielding screen and the patient's torso (incorrect); and when there is no gap between the bottom edge of the shielding screen and the patient's torso (correct). This AR application was used by 33 medical staff, after which an Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) based on the John Keller's ARCS (four categories of Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction) Motivation Model, consisting of 36-items with responses on a 5-point (1-5) Likert scale, was conducted. Result(s): The overall score was a high 4.67 +/- 0.30 (mean +/- standard deviation). Physician's scores tended to be lower than those of other medical staff in the categories of Attention, Relevance, and Satisfaction (not statistically significant).

Usefulness of virtual reality in assessment of medical student laparoscopic skill,"Matzke, J.; Ziegler, C.; Martin, K.; Crawford, S.; Sutton, E.","Background This study evaluates if undergraduate medical trainees' laparoscopic skills acquisition could be assessed using a virtual reality (VR) simulator and how the resultant metrics correlate with performance of Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) tasks. Our hypothesis is that the VR simulator metrics will correlate with passing results in a competency-based curriculum (FLS). Materials and methods Twenty-eight fourth-year medical students applying for surgical residency were recruited to participate in a VR training curriculum comprised of camera navigation, hand eye coordination, and FLS tasks: circle cutting (CC), ligating loop (LL), peg transfer (PT), and intracorporeal knot tying (IKT). Students were given 8 wk to achieve proficiency goals, after which they were observed performing FLS tasks. The ability of the VR simulator to detect penalties in each of the FLS tasks and correlations of time taken to complete tasks are reported. Results Twenty-five students trained in all components of the curriculum. All students were proficient in camera navigation and hand eye coordination tasks. Proficiency was achieved in CC, LL, PT, and IKT by 21, 19, 23, and one student, respectively. VR simulation showed high specificity for predicting zero penalties on the observed CC, LL, and PT tasks (80%, 75%, and 80%, respectively). Conclusions VR can be used to assess medical student's acquisition of laparoscopic skills. The absence of penalties in the simulator reasonably predicts the absence of penalties in all FLS skills, except IKT. The skills acquired by trainees can be used in residency for further monitoring of progress toward proficiency.

The role of virtual reality in the training for carotid artery stenting: The perspective of trainees,"Mazzaccaro, D.; Miri, R.; Derbel, B.; Righini, P.; Nano, G.","After forming the solid clinical foundations, physicians who perform carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedures begin their frequency in the operating room and gradually approach, with an increasingly effective participation, in the execution of surgical interventions, endovascular or hybrid procedures concerning all the districts. A t this stage, the guidance of the various tutors is of great importance. Naturally, it is always difficult for everyone to go from theory to clinical practice. The training of surgeons who will perform C A S procedures is therefore carried out mainly on patients, with all risks concerning the safety of patients themselves. Simulation has been proposed as a way to improve learning curves in many surgical and endovascular procedures, without any risk of harm to operators or patients. Virtual reality in fact has proved to be of benefit in the acquisition of basic skills by novice operators, as well as in assessing technical skills. Aim of this review was to describe our experience in the use of virtual reality for the training of young surgeons for C A S procedures.

Characteristics and efficacy of digital health education: An overview of systematic reviews,"McCall, M.; Spencer, E.; Owen, H.; Roberts, N.; Heneghan, C.","Objective: The primary aim of this overview was to synthesise results from studies including digital education and its effect on knowledge or learning outcomes, student satisfaction, student enrolment, attendance rate, course completion rate, clinical practice, health outcomes for patients and cost-effectiveness in health-care education. A secondary aim was to report on successful instructional design strategies, and barriers or contextual factors influencing the effectiveness of online learning course delivery in healthcare education. Method(s): We conducted an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) for digital education interventions delivered to health-care students and practitioners. Result(s): We scanned 848 titles, reviewed 247 abstracts and assessed 49 full-text articles against pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This overview includes data collected from 31,730 participants across 16 SRs. The quality of evidence included in the SRs ranged from very low (n = 2), low (n = 6) to moderate (n = 8). The best available SRs were of moderate quality (7.4 of 11 AMSTAR). SR authors did not report other teaching methods as being superior to digital learning. In most cases (n = 9), digital education when used in addition to traditional methods augmented knowledge acquisition. Other SRs (n = 7) did not show statistically significant differences across interventions including digital education as a replacement, or additive resource to traditional intervention. Conclusion(s): Student enrolment, attendance rates, course completion rates, cost-effectiveness and changes in clinical outcomes for patients are underreported in the existing evidence. Although the quality and quantity of data are limited, evidence-based instructional design for digital education is becoming more possible, especially as educators establish learning activities that track to learning objectives for knowledge acquisition in health care.

Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis training and non-rhexis related vitreous loss: The specificity of virtual reality simulator surgical training (an American ophthalmological society thesis),"McCannel, C. A.","Purpose: To assess the specificity of simulation-based virtual reality ophthalmic cataract surgery training on the Eyesi ophthalmic virtual reality surgical simulator, and test the hypothesis that microsurgical motor learning is highly specific. Method(s): Retrospective educational interventional case series. The rates of vitreous loss and retained lens material, and vitreous loss and retained lens material associated with an errant continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) were assessed among 1037 consecutive cataract surgeries performed during four consecutive academic years at a teaching hospital. The data were grouped by Eyesi use and capsulorhexis intensive training curriculum (CITC) completion. The main intervention was the completion of the CITC on the Eyesi. Result(s): In the Eyesi simulator experience-based stratification, the vitreous loss rate was similar in each group (chi square p=0.95) and was not preceded by an errant CCC in 86.2% for ""CITC done at least once"", 57.1% for ""CITC not done, but some Eyesi use"", and 48.9% for ""none"" training groups (p=4X10-5). Retained lens material overall and occurring among the errant CCC cases was similar among training groups (p=0.82 and p=0.71, respectively). Conclusion(s): Eyesi capsulorhexis training was not associated with lower vitreous loss rates overall. However, non-errant CCC associated vitreous loss was higher among those who underwent Eyesi capsulorhexis training. Training focused on the CCC portion of cataract surgery may not reduce vitreous loss unassociated with an errant CCC. It is likely that surgical training is highly specific to the task being trained. Residents may need to be trained for all surgical steps with adequate intensity to minimize overall complication rates.

Hands-on laboratories to teach entry-level skills have traditionally used anesthetized laboratory dogs (live dog laboratory [LDL]).Virtual-reality endoscopy trainers (VRET) are used for this purpose in human medicine with the clear benefits of avoiding live animal use, decreasing trainee stress, and allowing repeated, independent training sessions. However, there are currently no commercially available veterinary endoscopy simulators.The purpose of the study was to determine whether a human VRET can be a reasonable alternative to a LDL for teaching early veterinary endoscopy skills. Twelve veterinarians with limited or no endoscopy experience underwent training with a VRET (n = 6) or a LDL (n = 6), performed two recorded esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) on anesthetized dogs for evaluation purposes (outcomes laboratory), and then underwent training with the alternative method. Participants completed questionnaires before any training and following each training session. No significant differences were found between training methods based on: measured parameters from the outcomes laboratory, including duration of time to perform EGD; evaluators' assessment of skills; and, assessment of skills through blinded review of the esophageal portion of EGD recordings.TheVRET was less stressful for participants than the LDL (p = .02).

Ineffective communication between such individuals and doctors remains an important barrier. There is a need to provide medical students with a deeper understanding of such challenges. Increasingly, simulation is being used to develop empathy skills. In this study, we aimed to seek a deep understanding of medical students' experiences of being placed in the role of a hearing-impaired patient by means of a virtual reality (VR) simulation. Methods A multidisciplinary group developed a 360degree VR video-learning experience. This experience portrayed a consultation with a doctor from a hearing-impaired individual's perspective. A qualitative study approach, using hermeneutic phenomenology, was conducted. Following the VR experience, students were interviewed, and transcripts of interviews were analysed using a Template Analysis approach. Results Analysis yielded four main themes: (1) a much more than just watching a video': a VR experience of hearing impairment; (2) a hearing through their ears': experiencing a person's world with hearing impairment; (3) a not just what you can't hear..but how it makes you feel': reactions evoked by a VR hearing impairment experience and (4) redirecting my future professional self?

On the effectiveness of virtual reality-based training for surgical robot setup,"Mehrfard, A.; Fotouhi, J.; Forster, T.; Taylor, G.; Fer, D.; Nagle, D.; Armand, M.; Navab, N.; Fuerst, B.","Virtual Reality (VR) is rapidly increasing in popularity as a teaching tool. It allows the creation of a highly immersive, three-dimensional virtual environment. With more robots saturating the industry, there is a need to train end-users on how to set up, operate, tear down, and troubleshoot the robot. While VR has become widely used in training surgeons on the psychomotor skills associated with operating the robot, little research has been done to see how the benefits of VR could translate to teaching the bedside staff, tasked with supporting the robot during the surgical procedure. We trained 30 participants on how to set up a robotic arm in an environment mimicking clinical setup. We divided these participants into three groups with one group trained with paper-based instructions, one with video-based instructions and one with VR-based instructions. We then compared these three different training methods. VR and paper were highly favoured training mediums over video. VR-trained participants achieved slightly higher fidelity of robotic joint angles, suggesting better comprehension of the spatial awareness skills necessary to achieve desired arm positioning.

Virtual reality technologies for clinical education: evaluation metrics and comparative analysis,"Mehrfard, A.; Fotouhi, J.; Taylor, G.; Forster, T.; Armand, M.; Navab, N.; Fuerst, B.","With recent advances of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, the deployment of such will dramatically increase in non-entertainment environments, such as professional education and training, manufacturing, service, or low frequency/high-risk scenarios. Clinical education is an area that especially stands to benefit from VR technology due to the complexity, high cost, and difficult logistics. The effectiveness of the deployment of VR systems in healthcare environments is subject to factors that may not be necessarily considered for devices targeting the entertainment market. In this work, we systematically compare a wide range of VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) technologies and designs by defining a new set of metrics that are 1) relevant to medical VR solutions and 2) are of paramount importance for VR-based education and training. We evaluated 10 technologies based on various criteria, including neck strain, heat development, cleanability, and colour accuracy. Other metrics such as text readability, comfort, and contrast perception were evaluated in a multi-user study on three selected technologies, namely the ones offered by Oculus Rift S, HTC Vive Pro and Samsung Odyssey+. Results indicate that the HTC Vive Pro performs best with regards to comfort, display quality and compatibility with glasses.

See like an Expert: Gaze-Augmented Training Enhances Skill Acquisition in a Virtual Reality Robotic Suturing Task,"Melnyk, R.; Campbell, T.; Holler, T.; Cameron, K.; Saba, P.; Witthaus, M. W.; Joseph, J.; Ghazi, A.","Introduction: The da Vinci Skills Simulator (DVSS) is an effective platform for robotic skills training. Novel training methods using expert gaze patterns to guide trainees have demonstrated superiority to traditional instruction. Portable head-mounted eye-trackers (HMET) offer the opportunity for eye tracking technology to enhance surgical robotic simulation training. Objective(s): To evaluate if training guided by expert gaze patterns can improve trainee performance over standard movement training techniques during robotic simulation. Method(s): Medical students were recruited and randomized into gaze training (GT, n = 9) and movement training (MT, n = 8) groups. First, the participants reviewed an instructional video, with the GT group emulating expert gaze patterns and the MT group (n = 8) standard movement-based instruction. Training consisted of 10 repetitions of ""Suture Sponge 3""on the DVSS while wearing HMET; the first three repetitions were followed by group-appropriate video coaching (gaze vs movement feedback), while the remaining repetitions were without feedback. Finally, two multitasking repetitions with a secondary bell-counting task were completed. Primary outcomes included DVSS scores during training and multitasking. Secondary outcomes included metrics collected from the HMET (gaze patterns and gaze entropy). Result(s): Total score, efficiency, and penalties improved significantly over the training in both groups; the GT group achieved higher scores on every attempt. Total scores in the GT group were higher than the MT group postvideo review (20.3 +/- 21.8 vs 3.0 +/- 6.2, p = 0.047), after coaching repetitions (61.8 +/- 18.8 vs 30.1 +/- 26.2, p = 0.01), and at the last training attempt (73.0 +/- 16.5 vs 63.1 +/- 17.4, p = 0.247). During multitasking, the GT group maintained higher total scores (75 +/- 10.1 vs 63.3 +/- 15.3, p = 0.01), efficiency (86.3 +/- 7.4 vs 77.4 +/- 11.2, p = 0.009), and superior secondary task performance (error: 6.3% +/- 0.06 vs 10.7% +/- 0.11, p = 0.20). Gaze entropy (cognitive-load indicator) and gaze pattern analysis showed similar trends. Conclusion(s): Gaze-augmented training leads to more efficient movements through adoption of expert gaze patterns that withstand additional stressors. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.",2021,March,Journal of Endourology,35(3),,376-382,634504588,,,#3400,Melnyk 2021,,

What do speech pathology students gain from virtual patient interviewing? A WHO International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) analysis,"Miles, A.; Hayden, S.; Carnell, S.; Halan, S.; Lok, B.","Background Virtual patients have an established place in medical education but do virtual patient interviews train holistic clinicians or just diagnosticians? This study explored speech pathology students' virtual patient interviews using WHO International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF). Methods Eighteen speech pathology students in their final year of training participated. Students interviewed virtual patients with dysphagia (swallowing difficulties) as part of their curriculum. Student questions and patient responses were coded using established ICF coding. Codes were tallied and compared under categories of body structures, body functions, activities/participation and environmental factors. Flesch Reading Ease was calculated as a measure of health literacy. Results Conversational turns primarily focused on the ICF component-activity and participation in both student questions and virtual patient responses: 0.03% body structures, 30% body functions-swallowing, 7% body functions-associated, 43% activities/participation and 19% environmental factors. Personal factors such as gender, ethnicity, age or socio-economic situation were not mentioned by student or patient. Patients commented on social impact on self and/or family, sometimes in the absence of targeted student questions. Student and virtual patient Flesch Reading Ease scores were congruent. Conclusion Speech pathology students naturally matched their virtual patient's health-literacy level and asked a range of medical and daily living questions. Virtual patients readily offered social impact information to student questions. Computer science: healthcare teams should consider creating virtual patients who challenge students to practise asking sensitive questions and in doing so develop holistic thinkers with competent communication skills.

The virtual operative assistant: An explainable artificial intelligence tool for simulation-based training in surgery and medicine,"Mirchi, N.; Bissonnette, V.; Yilmaz, R.; Ledwos, N.; Winkler-Schwartz, A.; Del Maestro, R. F.","Simulation-based training is increasingly being used for assessment and training of psychomotor skills involved in medicine. The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has provided new methodologies to utilize large amounts of data for educational purposes. A significant criticism of the use of artificial intelligence in education has been a lack of transparency in the algorithms' decision-making processes. This study aims to 1) introduce a new framework using explainable artificial intelligence for simulation-based training in surgery, and 2) validate the framework by creating the Virtual Operative Assistant, an automated educational feedback platform. Twenty-eight skilled participants (14 staff neurosurgeons, 4 fellows, 10 PGY 4-6 residents) and 22 novice participants (10 PGY 1-3 residents, 12 medical students) took part in this study. Participants performed a virtual reality subpial brain tumor resection task on the NeuroVR simulator using a simulated ultrasonic aspirator and bipolar. Metrics of performance were developed, and leave-one-out cross validation was employed to train and validate a support vector machine in Matlab. The classifier was combined with a unique educational system to build the Virtual Operative Assistant which provides users with automated feedback on their metric performance with regards to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The Virtual Operative Assistant successfully classified skilled and novice participants using 4 metrics with an accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 92, 82 and 100%, respectively. A 2-step feedback system was developed to provide participants with an immediate visual representation of their standing related to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The educational system outlined establishes a basis for the potential role of integrating artificial intelligence and virtual reality simulation into surgical educational teaching. The potential of linking expertise classification, objective feedback based on proficiency benchmarks, and instructor input creates a novel educational tool by integrating these three components into a formative educational paradigm.

The use of mobile-aided learning in education of local anesthesia for the inferior alveolar nerve block,"Mladenovic, R.; Pereira, L.; Djordjevic, F.; Vlahovic, Z.; Mladenovic, K.; Cvetkovic, A.; Martinovic, B.; Mladenovic, J.; Popovski, J.","Background/Aim. Dental education has developed over the years, and various technologies have been included. Considering the fact that mobile devices are an imperative of modern time, the aim of our research was to evaluate effectiveness of Mobile-Aided Learning on practical administering the inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB). Methods. This prospective study involved 34 students who were randomly divided into two groups: G1 (control) group with 16 students and G2 (study) group with 18 students. Students of both groups previously successfully completed theoretical and practical training provided by the curriculum. For the purpose of additional education, students of the G2 group used a mobile application for 3D simulation of local anesthesia (Mobile-Aided Learning) outside the dental office for a period of one semester. After that, all students completed a post-clinical questionnaire. Results. The average time for performing anesthesia by participants in the G1 group was 70.54 +/- 20.16 seconds, while in the G2 group it was 57.13 +/- 17.45 seconds, which was significantly shorter (p < 0.05). A successful anesthesia application was higher in the G2 group (83.3%) compared to the G1 group (75%). The results of the post-clinical test questionnaire also indicated difference in the mean values of the responses to all questions, which was in favor of the G2 group participants. Conclusion.

Can a virtual reality assessment of fine motor skill predict successful central line insertion?,"Mohamadipanah, H.; Parthiban, C.; Nathwani, J.; Rutherford, D.; DiMarco, S.; Pugh, C.","Background Due to the increased use of peripherally inserted central catheter lines, central lines are not performed as frequently. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a virtual reality (VR)-based assessment of fine motor skills can be used as a valid and objective assessment of central line skills. Methods Surgical residents (N = 43) from 7 general surgery programs performed a subclavian central line in a simulated setting. Then, they participated in a force discrimination task in a VR environment. Hand movements from the subclavian central line simulation were tracked by electromagnetic sensors. Gross movements as monitored by the electromagnetic sensors were compared with the fine motor metrics calculated from the force discrimination tasks in the VR environment. Results Long periods of inactivity (idle time) during needle insertion and lack of smooth movements, as detected by the electromagnetic sensors, showed a significant correlation with poor force discrimination in the VR environment. Also, long periods of needle insertion time correlated to the poor performance in force discrimination in the VR environment. Conclusions This study shows that force discrimination in a defined VR environment correlates to needle insertion time, idle time, and hand smoothness when performing subclavian central line placement. Fine motor force discrimination may serve as a valid and objective assessment of the skills required for successful needle insertion when placing central lines.

Can Virtual Reality Be Used to Track Skills Decay During the Research Years?,"Mohamadipanah, H.; Perrone, K.; Peterson, K.; Garren, M.; Parthiban, C.; Sunkara, A.; Zinn, M.; Pugh, C.","Background: Time away from surgical practice can lead to skills decay. Research residents are thought to be prone to skills decay, given their limited experience and reduced exposure to clinical activities during their research training years. This study takes a cross-sectional approach to assess differences in residents' skills at the beginning and end of their research years using virtual reality. We hypothesized that research residents will have measurable decay in psychomotor skills when evaluated using virtual reality. Method(s): Surgical residents (n = 28) were divided into two groups; the first group was just beginning their research time (clinical residents: n = 19) and the second group (research residents: n = 9) had just finished at least 2 y of research. All participants were asked to perform a target-tracking task using a haptic device, and their performance was compared using Welch's t-test. Result(s): Research residents showed a higher level of ""tracking error"" (1.69 +/- 0.44 cm versus 1.40 +/- 0.19 cm; P = 0.04) and a similar level of ""path length"" (62.5 +/- 10.5 cm versus 62.1 +/- 5.2 cm; P = 0.92) when compared with clinical residents. Conclusion(s): The increased ""tracking error"" among residents at the end of their research time suggests fine psychomotor skills decay in residents who spend time away from clinical duties during laboratory time. This decay demonstrates the need for research residents to regularly participate in clinical activities, simulation, or assessments to minimize and monitor skills decay while away from clinical practice. Additional longitudinal studies may help better map learning and decay curves for residents who spend time away from clinical practice.

Screening surgical residents' laparoscopic skills using virtual reality tasks: Who needs more time in the sim lab?,"Mohamadipanah, H.; Perrone, K. H.; Nathwani, J.; Parthiban, C.; Peterson, K.; Wise, B.; Garren, A.; Pugh, C.","Background: This study investigated the possibility of using virtual reality perceptual-motor tasks as a screening tool for laparoscopic ability. We hypothesized that perceptual-motor skills assessed using virtual reality will correlate with the quality of simulated laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. Material(s) and Method(s): Surgical residents (N = 37), performed 2 virtual reality perceptual-motor tasks: (1) force matching and (2) target tracking. Participants also performed a laparoscopic ventral hernia repair on a simulator and final product quality score, and endoscopic visualization errors were calculated. Correlational analysis was performed to assess the relationship between performance on virtual reality tasks and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. Result(s): Residents with poor performance on force matching in virtual reality-""peak deflection"" (r = -0.34, P <.05) and ""summation distance"" (r = -0.36, P <.05)-had lower final product quality scores. Likewise, poor performance in virtual reality-based target tracking-""path length"" (r = -0.49, P <.05) and ""maximum distance"" (r = -0.37, P <.05)-correlated with a lower final product quality score. Conclusion(s): Our findings support the notion that virtual reality could be used as a screening tool for perceptual-motor skill.

Virtual reality as a teaching method for resuscitation training in undergraduate first year medical students during COVID-19 pandemic: a randomised controlled trial,"Moll-Khosrawi, P.; Falb, A.; Pinnschmidt, H.; Zollner, C.; Issleib, M.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is a computer-generated simulation technique which yields plenty of benefits and its application in medical education is growing. This study explored the effectiveness of a VR Basic Life Support (BLS) training compared to a web-based training during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which face-to-face trainings were disrupted or reduced. METHOD(S): This randomised, double-blinded, controlled study, enrolled 1st year medical students. The control group took part in web-based BLS training, the intervention group received an additional individual VR BLS training. The primary endpoint was the no-flow time-an indicator for the quality of BLS-, assessed during a structural clinical examination, in which also the overall quality of BLS (secondary outcome) was rated. The tertiary outcome was the learning gain of the undergraduates, assessed with a comparative self-assessment (CSA). RESULT(S): Data from 88 undergraduates (n=46 intervention- and n=42 control group) were analysed. The intervention group had a significant lower no-flow time (p=.009) with a difference between the two groups of 28% (95%-CI [8%;43%]). The overall BLS performance of the intervention group was also significantly better than the control group with a mean difference of 15.44 points (95%-CI [21.049.83]), p<.001. In the CSA the undergraduates of the intervention group reported a significant higher learning gain. CONCLUSION(S): VR proved to be effective in enhancing process quality of BLS, therefore, the integration of VR into resuscitation trainings should be considered. Further research needs to explore which combination of instructional designs leads to deliberate practice and mastery learning of BLS. Copyright © 2022.

"A high-fidelity, virtual reality, transurethral resection of bladder tumor simulator: Validation as a tool for training","Moore, J.; Whalen, S.; Rowe, N.; Lee, J.; Ordon, M.; Lantz-Powers, A.","Introduction: Simulation-based training is used to help trainees learn surgical procedures in a safe environment. The objective of our study was to test the face, content, and construct validity of the transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) module built on the Simbionix TURP Mentor simulator. Method(s): Participants performed five standardized cases on the simulator. Domains of the simulator were evaluated on a five-point Likert scale to establish face and content validity. Construct validity was assessed through the simulator's built-in scoring metrics, as well as video recordings of the simulator screen and an anonymized view of participants' hands and feet, which were evaluated using an objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) tool. Result(s): Ten experienced operators and 15 novices participated. Face validity was somewhat acceptable (mean realism 3.8/5+/-1.03 standard deviation [SD]; mean appearance 4.1/5+/-0.57), as was content validity, represented by simulation of key steps (mean 3.9+/-0.57). The simulator failed to achieve construct validity. There was no difference in mean simulator scores or OSATS scoring between experienced operators and novices. Novices significantly improved their mean simulator scores (305.9 vs. 332.4, p=0.006) and OSATS scoring (15.8 vs. 18.1, p=0.001), while 87% felt their confidence to perform TURBT improved. Overall, 92% of participants agreed that the simulator should be incorporated into residency training. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests a role for the TURBT module of the Simbionix TURP Mentor simulator as an introduction to TURBT for urology trainees.

Validation of a novel virtual reality simulation system with the focus on training for surgical dissection during laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy,"Mori, T.; Ikeda, K.; Takeshita, N.; Teramura, K.; Ito, M.","BACKGROUND: Mastery of technical skills is one of the fundamental goals of surgical training for novices. Meanwhile, performing laparoscopic procedures requires exceptional surgical skills compared to open surgery. However, it is often difficult for trainees to learn through observation and practice only. Virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation is expanding and rapidly advancing. A major obstacle for laparoscopic trainees is the difficulty of well-performed dissection. Therefore, we developed a new VR simulation system, Lap-PASS LP-100, which focuses on training to create proper tension on the tissue in laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy dissection. This study aimed to validate this new VR simulation system. METHOD(S): A total of 50 participants were asked to perform medial dissection of the meso-sigmoid colon on the VR simulator. Forty-four surgeons and six non-medical professionals working in the National Cancer Center Hospital East, Japan, were enrolled in this study. The surgeons were: laparoscopic surgery experts with>100 laparoscopic surgeries (LS), 21 were novices with experience<100 LS, and five without previous experience in LS. The participants' surgical performance was evaluated by three blinded raters using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS). RESULT(S): There were significant differences (P-values<0.044) in all GOALS items between the non-medical professionals and surgeons. The experts were significantly superior to the novices in one item of GOALS: efficiency ([4(4-5) vs. 4(3-4)], with a 95% confidence interval, p=0.042). However, both bimanual dexterity and total score in the experts were not statistically different but tended to be higher than in the novices. CONCLUSION(S): Our study demonstrated a full validation of our new system. This could detect the surgeons' ability to perform surgical dissection and suggest that this VR simulator could be an effective training tool. This surgical VR simulator might have tremendous potential to enhance training for surgeons. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).",2022,8-Jan,BMC surgery,22(1),,12,,,,#3548,Mori 2022,,

Result(s): Experts highly rated the realism and usefulness of our simulator, reflected by the average face validity score of 4.39 and content validity score of 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale. Comparisons with a Mann-Whitney U test revealed significant differences (p< 0.05) in performances between the experts and novices on 6 out of 7 evaluation metrics, demonstrating strong construct validity. Furthermore, a paired T-test indicated significant performance improvements (p< 0.05) of the novices in both objective and subjective evaluation after training with our simulator. Conclusion(s): Our cost-effective, flexible, and easily customizable AR training simulator can provide opportunities for trainees to acquire basic skills of US-guided PCA in a safe and stress-free environment. The effectiveness of our simulator is demonstrated through strong face, content, and construct validity, indicating its value as a novel training tool.

Augmented reality system for digital rectal examination training and assessment: System validation,"Muangpoon, T.; Osgouei, R. H.; Escobar-Castillejos, D.; Kontovounisios, C.; Bello, F.","Background: Digital rectal examination is a difficult examination to learn and teach because of limited opportunities for practice; however, the main challenge is that students and tutors cannot see the finger when it is palpating the anal canal and prostate gland inside the patients. Objective(s): This paper presents an augmented reality system to be used with benchtop models commonly available in medical schools with the aim of addressing the problem of lack of visualization. The system enables visualization of the examining finger, as well as of the internal organs when performing digital rectal examinations. Magnetic tracking sensors are used to track the movement of the finger, and a pressure sensor is used to monitor the applied pressure. By overlaying a virtual finger on the real finger and a virtual model on the benchtop model, students can see through the examination and finger maneuvers. Method(s): The system was implemented in the Unity game engine (Unity Technologies) and uses a first-generation HoloLens (Microsoft Inc) as an augmented reality device. To evaluate the system, 19 participants (9 clinicians who routinely performed digital rectal examinations and 10 medical students) were asked to use the system and answer 12 questions regarding the usefulness of the system. Result(s): The system showed the movement of an examining finger in real time with a frame rate of 60 fps on the HoloLens and accurately aligned the virtual and real models with a mean error of 3.9 mm. Users found the movement of the finger was realistic (mean 3.9, SD 1.2); moreover, they found the visualization of the finger and internal organs were useful for teaching, learning, and assessment of digital rectal examinations (finger: Mean 4.1, SD 1.1; organs: Mean 4.6, SD 0.8), mainly targeting a novice group. Conclusion(s): The proposed augmented reality system was designed to improve teaching and learning of digital rectal examination skills by providing visualization of the finger and internal organs. The initial user study proved its applicability and usefulness. Copyright © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

"Validity evidence for a new portable, lower-cost platform for the fundamentals of endoscopic surgery skills test","Mueller, C. L.; Kaneva, P.; Fried, G. M.; Mellinger, J. D.; Marks, J. M.; Dunkin, B. J.; van Sickle, K.; Vassiliou, M. C.","Background: The fundamentals of endoscopic surgery (FES) examination measures the knowledge and skills required to perform safe flexible endoscopy. A potential limitation of the FESTM skills test is the size and cost of the simulator on which it was developed (GI MentorTM II virtual reality endoscopy simulator; Simbionix LTD, Israel). A more compact and lower-cost alternative (GI MentorTM Express) was developed to address this issue. The purpose of this study was to obtain evidence for the validity of scores obtained on the Express platform, so that it can be used for testing. Study design: General surgery residents at various levels of training and practicing endoscopists at five institutions participated. Each completed the five FES tasks on both simulator platforms in random order, with 3-14 days between tests. Scores were calculated using the same standardized computer-generated algorithm and compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Result(s): There were 58 participants (mean age 32; 76 % male) with a broad range of endoscopic experience. The mean (95 % confidence interval) FES scores were 72 (67:77) on the GI MentorTM II and 66 (60:71) on the Express. The correlation between scores on the two platforms was 0.86 (0.77:0.91; p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): There is a high correlation between FES manual skills scores measured on the original platform and the new Express, providing evidence to support the use of the GI MentorTM Express for FES testing.

Transferable Global Rating Scales in the Validation of the ArthroSimTM Virtual Reality Arthroscopy Simulator,"Mulligan, A.; Vaghela, K. R.; Jeyaseelan, L.; Lee, J.; Akhtar, K.","INTRODUCTION: Virtual reality arthroscopic simulators are becoming increasingly prevalent in the orthopaedic training environment. The construct validity of the ArthroSim virtual reality simulator (TolTech Touch of Life Technologies, Aurora, Colorado) has been established based on time to completion comparison between candidates of differing levels of surgical experience. This study aims to establish the construct validity of the ArthroSim virtual reality simulator using validated global rating scales that allow direct comparison with intraoperative performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight novices (medical students), eight intermediates (registrars), and seven experts (consultants) were assessed using the Imperial Global Arthroscopy Rating Scale (IGARS) and the Arthroscopic Surgical Skills Evaluation Tool (ASSET) scoring systems while carrying out a standardised basic diagnostic knee arthroscopy using linked and anonymised recordings of both the arthroscopy video output and candidate's hand posture and position. Time to completion was recorded and the expert group also filled out questionnaires assessing the face and content validity of the simulator. RESULT(S): The mean IGARS/ASSET scores for the novice, intermediate and expert groups were 14/11, 29/22, and 46/36 respectively. The difference in score between each of the groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). The average time to completion was 257 seconds, 305 seconds, and 204 seconds respectively. The time to completion was not significantly different between the groups (p=0.6). CONCLUSION(S): The ArthroSim virtual reality simulator could effectively distinguish between candidates of differing experience levels using validated global rating scales and therefore demonstrated construct validity.",2020,28-Nov,Surgical technology international,37,,306-311,632385664,,,#3595,Mulligan 2020,,
Virtual reality simulation as a tool to monitor surgical performance indicators: VIRESI observational study,"Muralha, N.; Oliveira, M.; Ferreira, M. A.; Costa-Maia, J.","Introduction: Virtual reality simulation is a topic of discussion as a complementary tool to traditional laparoscopic surgical training in the operating room. However, it is unclear whether virtual reality training can have an impact on the surgical performance of advanced laparoscopic procedures. Our objective was to assess the ability of the virtual reality simulator LAP Mentor to identify and quantify changes in surgical performance indicators, after LAP Mentor training for digestive anastomosis. Material(s) and Method(s): Twelve surgeons from Centro Hospitalar de Sao Joao in Porto (Portugal) performed two sessions of advanced task 5: anastomosis in LAP Mentor, before and after completing the tutorial, and were evaluated on 34 surgical performance indicators. Result(s): The results show that six surgical performance indicators significantly changed after LAP Mentor training. The surgeons performed the task significantly faster as the median 'total time' significantly reduced (p < 0.05) from 759.5 to 523.5 seconds. Significant decreases (p < 0.05) were also found in median 'total needle loading time' (303.3 to 107.8 seconds), 'average needle loading time' (38.5 to 31.0 seconds), 'number of passages in which the needle passed precisely through the entrance dots' (2.5 to 1.0), 'time the needle was held outside the visible field' (20.9 to 2.4 seconds), and 'total time the needle-holders' ends are kept outside the predefined operative field' (88.2 to 49.6 seconds). Discussion(s): This study raises the possibility of using virtual reality training simulation as a benchmark tool to assess the surgical performance of Portuguese surgeons. Conclusion(s): LAP Mentor is able to identify variations in surgical performance indicators of digestive anastomosis.

'Evaluation of the introduction of a dental virtual simulator on the performance of undergraduate dental students in the pre-clinical operative dentistry course',"Murbay, S.; Neelakantan, P.; Chang, J. W. W.; Yeung, S.","INTRODUCTION: Virtual reality-based platforms are becoming increasingly popular in education. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of undergraduate dental students with the introduction of the Moog Simodont dental trainer (VR) within the pre-clinical curriculum in the direct restoration module of the operative dentistry course using manual and digital methods. METHOD(S): Thirty-two randomly selected year 2 undergraduate students were divided into two groups: group 1, exposed to the Moog Simodont dental trainer (VR) and group 2, no exposure to VR. All students were then evaluated in carrying out a Class I preparation in a single-blinded fashion. All preparations were evaluated by three assessors using a traditional manual approach and a digital software. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using chi-square test (alpha = 0.05). RESULT(S): The number of students who performed satisfactory preparations was more in group 1 (12/16), compared to group 2 (7/16). The percentage of satisfactory domains was significantly higher in group 1, compared to group 2, both in the manual evaluation (83.9% (94/112) and 59.8% (67/112) in groups 1 and 2, respectively) and in the digital evaluation (85.7% (96/112) and 55.4% (62/112) in groups 1 and 2, respectively) (P < .05). There was no significant difference between the manual and digital methods of evaluation with regard to the percentage of satisfactory or unsatisfactory preparations (P > .05). CONCLUSION(S): The use of the Moog Simodont dental trainer (VR) significantly improved the satisfactory performance of students. The virtual reality simulator may be a valuable adjunct in the undergraduate direct restorations course and for remedial student. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A Novel Suture Training System for Open Surgery Replicating Procedures Performed by Experts Using Augmented Reality,"Nagayo, Y.; Saito, T.; Oyama, H.","The surgical education environment has been changing significantly due to restricted work hours, limited resources, and increasing public concern for safety and quality, leading to the evolution of simulation-based training in surgery. Of the various simulators, low-fidelity simulators are widely used to practice surgical skills such as sutures because they are portable, inexpensive, and easy to use without requiring complicated settings. However, since low-fidelity simulators do not offer any teaching information, trainees do self-practice with them, referring to textbooks or videos, which are insufficient to learn open surgical procedures. This study aimed to develop a new suture training system for open surgery that provides trainees with the three-dimensional information of exemplary procedures performed by experts and allows them to observe and imitate the procedures during self-practice. The proposed system consists of a motion capture system of surgical instruments and a three-dimensional replication system of captured procedures on the surgical field. Motion capture of surgical instruments was achieved inexpensively by using cylindrical augmented reality (AR) markers, and replication of captured procedures was realized by visualizing them three-dimensionally at the same position and orientation as captured, using an AR device. For subcuticular interrupted suture, it was confirmed that the proposed system enabled users to observe experts' procedures from any angle and imitate them by manipulating the actual surgical instruments during self-practice. We expect that this training system will contribute to developing a novel surgical training method that enables trainees to learn surgical skills by themselves in the absence of experts.

Augmented reality self-training system for suturing in open surgery: A randomized controlled trial,"Nagayo, Y.; Saito, T.; Oyama, H.","Background: Existing self-training materials are insufficient to learn open surgical procedures, and a new self-training system that provides three-dimensional procedural information is needed. The effectiveness and usability of a self-training system providing three-dimensional information by augmented reality (AR) were compared to those of an existing self-training system, instructional video, in self-learning of suturing in open surgery. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a prospective, evaluator-blinded, randomized, controlled study. Medical students who were suturing novices were randomized into 2 groups: practice with the AR training system (AR group) or an instructional video (video group). Participants were instructed in subcuticular interrupted suture and each training system and watched the instructional video once. They then completed a pretest performing the suture on a skin pad. Participants in each group practiced the procedure 10 times using each training system, followed by a posttest. The pretest and posttest were video-recorded and graded by blinded evaluators using a validated scoring form composed of global rating (GR) and task-specific (TS) subscales. Students completed a post-study questionnaire assessing system usability, each system's usefulness, and their confidence and interest in surgery. Result(s): Nineteen participants in each group completed the trial. No significant difference was found between the AR and video groups on the improvement of the scores from pretest to posttest (GR: p = 0.54, TS: p = 0.91). The posttest scores of both GR and TS improved significantly from pretest in both groups (GR: both p < 0.001, TS: both p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the groups in the system usability scale scores (p = 0.38). The motion provided in the AR system was more helpful for manipulating surgical instruments than the video (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): The AR system was considered as understandable and easy to use as the instructional video in learning suture technique in open surgery for novices.

Anatomy education for medical students in a virtual reality workspace: A pilot study,"Nakai, K.; Terada, S.; Takahara, A.; Hage, D.; Tubbs, R. S.; Iwanaga, J.","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a challenge for many medical schools, as they have had to adjust their curricula into an online format. This was particularly problematic for anatomy courses as in person dissections have historically been preferred for providing students with a three-dimensional learning environment. In this study, we aim to share our experience with conducting anatomy lectures for medical student using a virtual reality (VR) workspace. Additionally, we discuss the advantages of using VR and expand on how it may be used to improve students' understanding of anatomy in comparison to various other online lecture formats. To do this, we utilized a post-lecture survey to gain feedback from the medical students that participated in a VR anatomy workspace. We found that many of our participants expressed that having access to their course material from anywhere and anytime via a virtual space, and being able to manipulate anatomical structures by moving and modifying them provided the student with a strong advantage. Although there are still limitations, we hope that our experience will assist other anatomy teachers with improving their lecture methods, especially during the pandemic.

Y.; Lozanoff, S.","Purpose: Extended reality (XR) technology enhances learning in medical education. The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a case-based approach for teaching radiological anatomy utilizing XR technology for improved student exploration and engagement. Method(s): The workflow consisted of MRI scanning cadavers followed by radiological, pathological, and anatomical assessment, and finally case presentation based on XR visualizations and student interaction. Case information (Subject, History, and Physical Exam) was presented to student groups who generated and recorded hypotheses using Google Forms. Result(s): Use of all components of the system was voluntary and a total of 74 students responded to the survey request (response rate = 95%). Assessment of the experience was conducted through a qualitative survey comprising four Likert scale questions (1-5, 1 lowest), three binary questions, and open-ended comments. Mean, standard deviation, and overall agreement (mean +/- SD, OA) showed that students found MRI scans of cadavers to be helpful for dissections (4.14 +/- 1.1, 74.3%) and provided an understanding of relevant anatomy (4.32 +/- 0.9, 79.7%), while 78.4% of students used the DICOM viewer to visualize scans of cadavers. The difficulty of use was found to be average (2.90 +/- 1.0, 23%). zSpace visualizations were used by 40.5% of students, generally agreeing that an understanding of spatial relationships improved as a result (3.60 +/- 1.0, 43.2%). More case-based sessions were favored by 97.3% of students.

A novel interactive educational system in the operating room--the IE system,"Nakayama, T.; Numao, N.; Yoshida, S.; Ishioka, J.; Matsuoka, Y.; Saito, K.; Fujii, Y.; Kihara, K.","BACKGROUND: The shortage of surgeon is one of the serious problems in Japan. To solve the problem, various efforts have been undertaken to improve surgical education and training. However, appropriate teaching methods in the operating room have not been well established. The aim of this study is to assess the utility of a novel interactive educational (IE) system for surgical education on urologic surgeries in the operating room. METHODS: A total of 20 Japanese medical students were educated on urologic surgery using the IE system in the operating room. The IE system consists of two parts. The first is three-dimensional (3D) magnified vision of the operative field using a 3D head-mounted display and a 3D endoscope. The second is interactive educative communication between medical students and surgeons using a small-sized wireless communication device. The satisfaction level with the IE system and the physical burden on medical students was examined via questionnaire. RESULTS: All students utilized the IE system in urologic surgery and responded to the survey. Most students were satisfied with the IE system. They also felt more welcomed by the surgeon when using the IE system than when not using it. No major unpleasant symptoms were observed but five students (25 %) experienced mild eye fatigue as a result of viewing the medical images. CONCLUSIONS: The IE system has the potential to motivate students to become interested in surgery and could be an efficient method of surgical education in the operating room.",2016,2-Feb,BMC medical education,16,,44,616094919,,,#3630,Nakayama 2016,,
Optimal combination of chest compression depth and rate in virtual reality resuscitation training: A post hoc analysis of the randomized lowlands saves lives trial,"Nas, J.; Thannhauser, J.; Van Geuns, R. J. M.; Van Royen, N.; Bonnes, J. L.; Brouwer, M. A.","BACKGROUND: Dissemination of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills is essential for cardiac arrest survival. Virtual reality (VR)-training methods are low cost and easily available, but to meet depth requirements adaptations are required, as con-firmed in a recent randomized study on currently prevailing CPR quality criteria. Recently, the promising clinical performance of new CPR quality criteria was demonstrated, based on the optimal combination of compression depth and rate. We now study compliance with these newly proposed CPR quality criteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Post hoc analysis of a randomized trial compared standardized 20-minute face-to-face CPR training with VR training using the Lifesaver VR smartphone application. During a posttraining test, compression depth and rate were measured using CPR mannequins. We assessed compliance with the newly proposed CPR criteria, that is, compression rate within +/-20% of 107/minute and depth within +/-20% of 47 mm. We studied 352 participants, age 26 (22-31) years, 56% female, and 15% with CPR training <2 years. Among VR-trained participants, there was a statistically significant difference between the proportions complying with newly proposed versus the currently prevailing quality criteria (52% versus 23%, P<0.001). The difference in proportions complying with rate requirements was statistically significant (96% for the new versus 50% for current criteria, P<0.001), whereas there was no significant difference with regard to the depth requirements (55% versus 51%, P=0.45). CONCLUSION(S): Lifesaver VR training, although previously found to be inferior to face-to-face training, may lead to CPR quality compliant with recently proposed, new quality criteria. If the prognostic importance of these new criteria is confirmed in additional studies, Lifesaver VR in its current form would be an easily available vector to disseminate CPR skills.

A.","Importance: Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is crucial for survival after cardiac arrest but not performed in most cases. New, low-cost, and easily accessible training methods, such as virtual reality (VR), may reach broader target populations, but data on achieved CPR skills are lacking. Objective(s): To compare CPR quality between VR and face-to-face CPR training. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Randomized noninferiority trial with a prospective randomized open blinded end point design. Participants were adult attendees from the science section of the Lowlands Music Festival (August 16 to 18, 2019) in the Netherlands. Analysis began September 2019. Intervention(s): Two standardized 20-minute protocols on CPR and automated external defibrillator use: Instructor-led face-to-face training or VR training using a smartphone app endorsed by the Resuscitation Council (United Kingdom). Main Outcomes and Measures: During a standardized CPR scenario following the training, we assessed the primary outcome CPR quality, measured as chest compression depth and rate using CPR manikins. Overall CPR performance was assessed by examiners, blinded for study groups, using a European Resuscitation Council-endorsed checklist (maximum score, 13). Additional secondary outcomes were chest compression fraction, proportions of participants with mean depth (50 mm-60 mm) or rate (100 min<sup>-1</sup>-120 min<sup>-1</sup>) within guideline ranges, and proportions compressions with full release. Result(s): A total of 381 participants were randomized: 216 women (57%); median (interquartile range [IQR]) age, 26 (22-31) years. The VR app (n = 190 [49.9%]) was inferior to face-to-face training (n = 191 [50.1%]) for chest compression depth (mean [SD], VR: 49 [10] mm vs face to face: 57 [5] mm; mean [95% CI] difference,-8 [-9 to-6] mm), and noninferior for chest compression rate (mean [SD]: VR: 114 [12] min<sup>-1</sup> vs face to face: 109 [12] min<sup>-1</sup>; mean [95% CI] difference, 6 [3 to 8] min<sup>-1</sup>). The VR group had lower overall CPR performance scores (median [IQR], 10 [8-12] vs 12 [12-13]; P <.001). Chest compression fraction (median [IQR], 61% [52%-66%] vs 67% [62%-71%]; P <.001) and proportions of participants fulfilling depth (51% [n = 89] vs 75% [n = 133], P <.001) and rate (50% [n = 87] vs 63% [n = 111], P =.01) requirements were also lower in the VR group. The proportion of compressions with full release was higher in the VR group (median [IQR], 98% [59%-100%] vs 88% [55%-99%]; P =.002). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized noninferiority trial, VR training resulted in comparable chest compression rate but inferior compression depth compared with face-to-face training. Given the potential of VR training to reach a larger target population, further development is needed to achieve the compression depth and overall CPR skills acquired by face-to-face training.

J.; Van Royen, N.; Bonnes, J. L.; Brouwer, M. A.","Introduction Layperson cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a key aspect in the chain of survival after cardiac arrest. New, low-cost, easily accessible training methods such as virtual reality (VR) training with a smartphone application may reach broader populations, but data on CPR performance are scarce. Methods and analysis The Lowlands Saves Lives trial is a prospective randomised open-blinded end-point evaluation study, comparing two 20 min CPR training protocols: standardised, certified instructor-led face-to-face training complying with current education guidelines (using Laerdal Little Anne manikins), and VR training, using the UK Resuscitation Council endorsed Lifesaver VR app. In the latter, chest compressions are practiced on a pillow. During VR training, participants learn to resuscitate by completing a filmed CPR scenario while wearing VR goggles and headphones. Eligible for inclusion are adult attendees of Lowlands Science, a specific section of the 3-day Lowlands music festival (50 000 attendees), dedicated exclusively to science. Following the training, all participants will perform a CPR test on a Laerdal Resusci Anne QCPR manikin. Primary outcome measures are depth and rate of chest compressions, measured using CPR manikins. The key secondary outcome is overall CPR performance, with real-time examination (blinded for study group) of all items of a European Resuscitation Council endorsed checklist, and evaluation of a sample of videotaped CPR tests by a blinded event committee. Given the unique setting of a festival, the primary additional analysis will address the impact of alcohol levels on CPR quality parameters and overall performance. Follow-up questionnaires will evaluate the attitude towards performing CPR. This unique study may provide important insights into innovative CPR training methods, factors that impact CPR performance and the impact on long-term attitude towards resuscitation.

Validation of a virtual reality laparoscopic appendicectomy simulator: a novel process using cognitive task analysis,"Nayar, S. K.; Musto, L.; Fernandes, R.; Bharathan, R.","Background: Virtual reality (VR) simulation is a vital component of surgical training with demonstrated improvements in surgical quality and clinical outcome. Aim(s): To validate the LAP Mentor (SimbionixTM) laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) VR simulator with inclusion of a novel tool, Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA). Method(s): Thirty-two novices and nine experienced surgeons performed two simulated LAs. An expert-consensus questionnaire guided face validity assessment. Content validity was assessed using CTA-derived questions encompassing eight operative steps and four decision points. Construct validity was evaluated using dexterity metrics, masked assessment of surgical quality using the OSATS global rating scale, and mental workload from two validated tools: the NASA-TLX and SMEQ. Ten novices performed eight further LAs for learning curve assessment. Result(s): Face validity was demonstrated across all domains. Considering content validity, the essential technical and non-technical steps were evident. The experienced group performed the procedure quicker (median time 361 vs. 538 s, P = 0.0039) with fewer total movements (426 vs. 641, P < 0.0001) and shorter idle time (131 vs. 199 s, P = 0.0006). This correlated with higher OSATS scores (median 33.5 vs. 22.2, P < 0.0001) and lower mental demand (NASA-TLX: 9.0 vs. 13.75, P = 0.012; SMEQ: 60 vs. 80, P = 0.0025), indicating construct validity. Learning curve data showed statistically significant improvements after the 7th session for procedure time, total movements and idle time, which correlated with reduction in mental demand. Conclusion(s): The LAP Mentor demonstrates face, content and construct validity for LA; thus, it can be used as an effective tool in surgical training.

Two databases, PubMed and Scopus, were systematically searched, and 20 articles were determined to meet the study inclusion criteria (full-length articles written in English). Of these, 11 studies examined construct validity, and 9 studies examined predictive validity. Although the construct validity of some VR simulators is yet to be established by multiple studies, many of the modules within the EyeSi simulator have been repeatedly validated. Furthermore, several studies have shown that VR simulator training improves overall cataract surgery performance. This review demonstrated the ability of cataract surgery VR simulators to differentiate surgical experience levels and improve operating room performance, which supports the use of VR simulators in ophthalmology residency training.

A virtual reality simulator for training the surgical reduction of patient-specific supracondylar humerus fractures,"Negrillo-Cardenas, J.; Jimenez-Perez, J. R.; Madeira, J.; Feito, F. R.","Purpose: Virtual reality has been used as a training platform in medicine, allowing the repetition of a situation/scenario as many times as needed and making it patient-specific prior to an operation. Of special interest is the minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO). It represents a novel technique for orthopedic trauma surgery, but requires intensive training to acquire the required skills. In this paper, we propose a virtual reality platform for training the surgical reduction of supracondylar fractures of the humerus using MIPO. The system presents a detailed surgical theater where the surgeon has to place the bone fragments properly. Method(s): Seven experienced users were selected to perform a surgical reduction using our proposal. Two paired humeri were scanned from a dataset obtained from the Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen. A virtual fracture was performed in one side of the pair, using the other as contralateral part. Users have to simulate a reduction for each case and fill out a survey about usability, using a five-option Likert scale. Result(s): The subjects have obtained excellent scores in both simulations. The users have notably reduced the time employed in the second experiment, being 60% less in average. Subjects have valued the usability (5.0), the intuitiveness (4.6), comfort (4.5), and realism (4.9) in a 1-5 Likert scale. The mean score of the usability survey was 4.66. Conclusion(s): The system has shown a high learning rate, and it is expected that the trainees will reach an expert level after additional runs. By focusing on the movement of bone fragments, specialists acquire motor skills to avoid the malrotation of MIPO-treated fractures. A future study can fulfill the requirements needed to include this training system into the protocol of real surgeries. Therefore, we expect the system to increase the confidence of the trainees as well as to improve their decision making.

Evaluation of the HystSimTM-virtual reality trainer: an essential additional tool to train hysteroscopic skills outside the operation theater,"Neis, F.; Brucker, S.; Henes, M.; Taran, F. A.; Hoffmann, S.; Wallwiener, M.; Schonfisch, B.; Ziegler, N.; Larbig, A.; De Wilde, R. L.","Background: Minimally invasive surgery is a major pillar of gynecological surgery. However, there are very few training opportunities outside the operation theater (OR) due to the cost and equipment requirements of organ simulators, virtual reality trainers (VRT) are promising tools to fill this gap. Method(s): Experienced and inexperienced participants of a minimally invasive surgery course followed the standardized HystSimTM-VRT training program. Result(s): Performance of 39 Participants (15 inexperienced and 24 experienced) was evaluated in the standardized hysteroscopic program HystSimTM. Tasks included three rounds of both a polyp and a myoma resection. Primary measurements were improvement in resection time, cumulative resection path length, and distention media use. Conclusion(s): The HystSimTM-VRT is an effective tool to improve the psychomotor skills needed in hysteroscopic surgery for experienced and inexperienced surgeons prior to OR exposure.

Video-based self-assessment enhances laparoscopic skills on a virtual reality simulator: a randomized controlled trial,"Netter, A.; Schmitt, A.; Agostini, A.; Crochet, P.","Background: Hysterectomy rates are decreasing in many countries, and virtual reality (VR) simulators bring new training opportunities for residents. As coaching interventions while training on a simulated complex procedure represents a resource challenge, alternative strategies to improve surgical skills must be investigated. We sought to determine whether self-guided learning using a video-based self-assessment (SA) leads to improved surgical skills in laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) on a VR simulator. Method(s): Twenty-four gynecology residents from two university hospitals were randomized into an SA group (n = 12) and a Control group (n = 12). Each participant's baseline performance on a validated VR basic task was assessed. Both groups then performed three virtually simulated LHs during which the participants received no guidance nor feedback. Following each LH, the SA group participants rated the video of their own performance using a generic and a procedure-specific rating scale, while the Control group participants watched an LH video demonstration. The LH videos of both groups' participants were blindly reviewed and rated by expert surgeons, using modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills scores (OSATS). Objective metrics recorded by the VR simulator were also compared. Result(s): There was no difference between the groups' baseline performances on the VR basic task. For the first LH, the OSATS-derived scores did not differ between SA and Control groups (9 [7-13] versus 9 [8-14]; p = 0.728). For the third LH, the OSATS-derived scores were higher for the SA group than for the Control group (17 [15-21] versus 15 [11-17], p = 0.039). Between the two groups, the objective metrics did not differ from the first to the third LH. Conclusion(s): The use of a structured video-based SA leads to improved procedural skills in LH on a VR simulator compared to watching benchmark expert performance, in a population of residents with moderate experience in the operating room.

Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumors: Next-generation Virtual Reality Training for Surgeons,"Neumann, E.; Mayer, J.; Russo, G. I.; Amend, B.; Rausch, S.; Deininger, S.; Harland, N.; da Costa, I. A.; Hennenlotter, J.; Stenzl, A.; Kruck, S.; Bedke, J.","Background: The number of virtual reality (VR) simulators is increasing. The aim of this prospective trial was to determine the benefit of VR cystoscopy (UC) and transurethral bladder tumor resection (TURBT) training in students. Design, setting, and participants: Medical students without endoscopic experience (n = 51, median age = 25 yr, median 4th academic year) were prospectively randomized into groups A and B. After an initial VR-UC and VR-TURBT task, group A (n = 25) underwent a video-based tutorial by a skilled expert. Group B (n = 26) was trained using a VR training program (Uro-Trainer). Following the training, every participant performed a final VR-UC and VR-TURBT task. Performance indicators were recorded via the simulator. Data was analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. Intervention(s): VR cystoscopy and TURBT. Results and limitations: No baseline and post-training differences were found for VR-UC between groups. During baseline, VR-TURBT group A showed higher inspected bladder surface than group B (56% vs 73%, p = 0.03). Subgroup analysis detected differences related to sex before training (male: 31.2% decreased procedure time; 38.1% decreased resectoscope movement; p = 0.02). After training, significant differences in procedure time (3.9 min vs 2.7 min, p = 0.007), resectoscope movement (857 mm vs 529 mm, p = 0.005), and accidental bladder injury (n = 3.0 vs n = 0.88, p = 0.003) were found. Male participants showed reduced blood loss (males: 3.92 ml vs females: 10.12 ml; p = 0.03) after training. Conclusion(s): Measuring endoscopic skills within a virtual environment can be done easily. Short training improved efficacy and safety of VR-TURBT. Nevertheless, transfer of improved VR performance into real world surgery needs further clarification. Patient Summary: We investigated how students without endoscopic experience profit from simulation-based training. The safe environment and repeated simulations can improve the surgical training. It may be possible to enhance patient's safety and the training of surgeons in long term. Simulator training teaches endourological interventions under controlled conditions. Students without endoscopic experience profit from simulation-based training. In conclusion, a simulation-based training is very useful to push the surgical learning curve of future urologist 2.0.

Telestration in the Teaching of Basic Surgical Skills: A Randomized Trial,"Neves Lopes, V.; Dantas, I.; Barbosa, J. P.; Barbosa, J.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how an affordable course using telestration with augmented reality can be compared to the traditional teaching of basic surgical skills. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized and blinded study. SETTING: Faculty of Medicine of Porto University. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Twenty medical students without any experience in basic surgical skills were randomized into two different learning groups: telestration and traditional teaching (on-site mentoring) groups. Five different types of sutures were taught: the single interrupted, the cruciate mattress, the horizontal mattress, the vertical mattress and the simple continuous sutures. Data was obtained on the time taken to learn each of the techniques and to perform each exercise without any support from the faculty, tension of the suture, quality of the procedure using a modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills and participants' answers to a Likert questionnaire in terms of their learning experience, confidence, and self-evaluation. RESULT(S): Trainees in the telestration group were globally faster when performing independently (1393.40 [SD 288.89] vs 1679.00 [SD 328.22] seconds, p = 0.04) particularly during the cruciate mattress suture (235.50 [SD 61.81] vs 290.00 [SD 68.77] seconds, p = 0.05) and the simple continuous suture (492.40 [SD 87.49] vs 630.30 [SD 132.34] seconds, p = 0.01).Time needed for students to learn the procedures was similar between the groups. There were also no statistically significant differences in terms of the quality of the surgical gesture, tension of the suture, self-evaluation or confidence. CONCLUSION(S): A basic surgical skills course using telestration through a head-mounted device with augmented reality capabilities can be a viable alternative to traditional teaching, considering time and quality of the gesture. Though costs can discourage from using this technology in basic procedures, the use of free software may turn it into an affordable option in the context of distant learning.

Impact of virtual reality simulation on learning barriers of phacoemulsification perceived by residents,"Ng, D. S. C.; Sun, Z.; Young, A. L.; Ko, S. T. C.; Lok, J. K. H.; Lai, T. Y. Y.; Sikder, S.; Tham, C. C.","Objective: To identify residents' perceived barriers to learning phacoemulsification surgical procedures and to evaluate whether virtual reality simulation training changed these perceptions. Design(s): The ophthalmology residents undertook a simulation phacoemulsification course and proficiency assessment on the Eyesi system using the previously validated training modules of intracapsular navigation, anti-tremor, capsulorrhexis, and cracking/chopping. A cross-sectional, multicenter survey on the perceived difficulties in performing phacoemulsification tasks on patients, based on the validated International Council of Ophthalmology's Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubric (ICO-OSCAR), using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = least and 5 = most difficulty), was conducted among residents with or without prior simulation training. Mann-Whitney U tests were carried out to compare the mean scores, and multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association of lower scores with the following potential predictors: 1) higher level trainee, 2) can complete phacoemulsification most of the time (>90%) without supervisor's intervention, and 3) prior simulation training. Setting(s): The study was conducted in ophthalmology residency training programs in five regional hospitals in Hong Kong. Result(s): Of the 22 residents, 19 responded (86.3%), of which 13 (68.4%) had completed simulation training. Nucleus cracking/chopping was ranked highest in difficulty by all respondents followed by capsulorrhexis completion and nucleus rotation/manipulation. Respondents with prior simulation training had significantly lower difficulty scores on these three tasks (nucleus cracking/chopping 3.85 vs 4.75, P = 0.03; capsulorrhexis completion 3.31 vs 4.40, P = 0.02; and nucleus rotation/manipulation 3.00 vs 4.75, P = 0.01). In multivariate analyses, simulation training was significantly associated with lower difficulty scores on these three tasks. Conclusion(s): Residents who had completed Eyesi simulation training had higher confidence in performing the most difficult tasks perceived during phacoemulsification.

Simulation-based camera navigation training in laparoscopy-a randomized trial,"Nilsson, C.; Sorensen, J. L.; Konge, L.; Westen, M.; Stadeager, M.; Ottesen, B.; Bjerrum, F.","Background: Inexperienced operating assistants are often tasked with the important role of handling camera navigation during laparoscopic surgery. Incorrect handling can lead to poor visualization, increased operating time, and frustration for the operating surgeon-all of which can compromise patient safety. The objectives of this trial were to examine how to train laparoscopic camera navigation and to explore the transfer of skills to the operating room. Material(s) and Method(s): A randomized, single-center superiority trial with three groups: The first group practiced simulation-based camera navigation tasks (camera group), the second group practiced performing a simulation-based cholecystectomy (procedure group), and the third group received no training (control group). Participants were surgical novices without prior laparoscopic experience. The primary outcome was assessment of camera navigation skills during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The secondary outcome was technical skills after training, using a previously developed model for testing camera navigational skills. The exploratory outcome measured participants' motivation toward the task as an operating assistant. Result(s): Thirty-six participants were randomized. No significant difference was found in the primary outcome between the three groups (p = 0.279). The secondary outcome showed no significant difference between the interventions groups, total time 167 s (95% CI, 118-217) and 194 s (95% CI, 152-236) for the camera group and the procedure group, respectively (p = 0.369). Both interventions groups were significantly faster than the control group, 307 s (95% CI, 202-412), p = 0.018 and p = 0.045, respectively. On the exploratory outcome, the control group for two dimensions, interest/enjoyment (p = 0.030) and perceived choice (p = 0.033), had a higher score. Conclusion(s): Simulation-based training improves the technical skills required for camera navigation, regardless of practicing camera navigation or the procedure itself. Transfer to the clinical setting could, however, not be demonstrated. The control group demonstrated higher interest/enjoyment and perceived choice than the camera group.

Simulation for percutaneous renal access: where are we?,"Noureldin, Y. A.; Andonian, S.","Objectives: Percutaneous renal access (PCA) is a challenging step during percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The aim of this study is to review the literature for different types of simulators described for PCA. Method(s): Databases of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, OvidSP, and Google Scholar were systematically searched until May 2016. The studies were analyzed regarding the type of simulator (nonbiologic, biologic, live animal, and virtual reality [VR]), type of validity (face, content, construct, and predictive), cost-effectiveness, and whether these simulators have been used for training and/or assessment of PCA. In addition, the study looked at the educational impact of these simulators in terms of the transfer of PCA skills to the operating room. Result(s): Several bench, animal, and VR simulators for training in PCA were identified. Only few studies were found on assessment of PCA skills. Biological bench models used porcine or bovine kidneys wrapped within foam, silicone, chicken carcass, or full-thickness skin flap alone. Other biological models used additional subcutaneous fascia, muscle, or ribs. Nonbiological models used prototypes, including 3D printing. Only one study reported the use of anesthetized live pig for training. The PERC MentorTM was the only VR simulator, which has been validated for training and assessment of PCA skills. However, none of these studies assessed the educational impact of PCA simulators. Furthermore, most of the studies did not address the validity and the cost of the simulator. Conclusion(s): While several biological and nonbiological PCA models exist, there is paucity of literature regarding the validity and educational impact of these simulators. The PERC Mentor simulator is the sole validated simulator for training and assessment of PCA skills. However, it is expensive and there is little evidence of its educational impact.

3D virtual reality simulation in radiography education: The students' experience,"O'Connor, M.; Stowe, J.; Potocnik, J.; Giannotti, N.; Murphy, S.; Rainford, L.","Introduction: Simulation forms a key element of undergraduate Radiography education as it enables students to develop their clinical skills in a safe environment. In this study, an immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual radiography simulation tool was piloted in an undergraduate Radiography curriculum and user feedback retrieved. Method(s): The 3D virtual simulation tool by Virtual Medical Coaching Ltd was introduced to first year radiography students (n = 105). This technology guided students through a comprehensive process of learning anatomy, radiographic positioning and pathology. Students then X-rayed a virtual patient in the VR suite using HTC Vive ProTM headsets and hand controllers. Instant feedback was provided. An online survey was later disseminated to students to gather user feedback. Thematic and descriptive statistical analyses were applied. Result(s): A response rate of 79% (n = 83) was achieved. Most respondents (58%) reported enjoying VR simulation, whilst some felt indifferent towards it (27%). Ninety-four percent would recommend this tool to other students. The mean length of time it took for students to feel comfortable using the technology was 60 min (10-240 min). Most respondents (58%) desired more VR access. Students attributed enhanced confidence in the areas of beam collimation (75%), anatomical marker placement (63%), centring of the X-ray tube (64%) and exposure parameter selection (56%) to their VR practice. Many students (55%) advocated the use of VR in formative or low stakes assessments. Issues flagged included technical glitches, inability to palpate patient and lack of constructive feedback. Conclusion(s): Student feedback indicates that 3D virtual radiography simulation is a valuable pedagogical tool in radiography education Implications for practice: 3D immersive VR simulation is perceived by radiography students to be a valuable learning resource.

This new immersive video type may be of particular usefulness in procedure-based healthcare settings. We hypothesized that VR echocardiography was non-inferior to live demonstration. Our aim was to assess the usefulness of a VR echocardiographic approach in teaching echocardiography to pediatric trainees compared to live demonstration. This was a single center, cross-sectional observational design. We used a Garmin VIRB 360 and a head-mount display to record live echocardiography exams in a pediatric population. An Oculus GoTM was used to view the 360degree immersive/VR videos. Trainees responded to a written questionnaire afterwards. Fifteen trainees participated in the study, each of whom had previously seen echocardiography through live demonstration teaching. Eleven respondents had previous hands-on echocardiography experience. All 15 participants confirmed that VR echocardiography is a useful teaching tool with 87% (n = 13) rating it as good or very good on a 5-point Likert scale. When asked to compare VR to live demonstration, 67% (n = 10) rated VR echocardiography as the same or better than live demonstration.

Development and Usability of a Virtual Reality-Based Filler Injection Training System,"Oh, S. M.; Kim, J. Y.; Han, S.; Lee, W.; Kim, I.; Hong, G.; Oh, W.; Moon, H.; Seo, C.","PURPOSE: As filler procedures have increased in popularity, serious injection-related complications (e.g., blindness and stroke) have also increased in number. Proper and effective training is important for filler procedure safety; however, limitations exist in traditional training methods (i.e. anatomical illustrations and cadaver studies). We aimed to describe the development process and evaluate the usability of a virtual reality (VR)-based aesthetic filler injection training system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the virtual reality hardware for the training system and a short guide, with a lecture regarding safe filler injection techniques. One hundred clinicians who attended a conference tested the training system. Participants completed system usability scale (SUS) and satisfaction questionnaires. RESULT(S): Nearly half of the participants were aged 35-50 years, and 38% had more than 5 years of aesthetic experience. The mean SUS score was 59.8 (standard deviation, 12.23), with no significant differences among the evaluated subgroups. Approximately 76% of participants provided SUS scores of more than 51, indicating acceptable usability. Participants aged 35-50 years were more likely to rate the system as having poor usability than were those aged<35 years (odds ratio=5.20, 95% confidence interval: 1.35-20.08).

There were no significant differences in the total A (autonomy), B (bimanual dexterity), D (depth perception), or T (tissue handling) GOALS scores. However, the total E (efficiency) score in the training group was higher than that in the non-training group (P = .030). The final LN score with LapPASS was significantly higher than the baseline (P = .004). CONCLUSION(S): The results of this study demonstrated that VR LN training improved performance in an actual operation. VR-based procedural simulation could become a vital part of the laparoscopic training program for residents. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

The impact of teacher's presence on learning basic surgical tasks with virtual reality headset among medical students,"Ojala, S.; Sirola, J.; Nykopp, T.; Kroger, H.; Nuutinen, H.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the presence of a teacher affects learning related outcomes in teaching basic surgical tasks with a Virtual Reality (VR) headset. METHOD(S): 26 fourth-year medical studentsparticipated in a voluntary exercise. Students practiced basic surgical procedure exercises using the VR4HEALTHCARE application in VR with OCULUS Rift S glasses. 12 students performed the exercises under the guidance of a teacher and 14 without the teacher present. After the exercise, the groups filled out a feedback form. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 software using the Mann-Whitney U test and multivariate analysis of variance. RESULT(S): The most important data collected related to whether the student learned something new and whether VR adds value to medical education. Ratings were based on a scale of 0-10 (0 = worst, 10 = best). When the teacher was present, on average, the students felt that they were learning something new and gave an average rating of 7.8 +/- 1.8, and when the teacher was not present 5.3 +/- 2.6 (p = 0.003). VR added value to teaching with a rating of 7.8 +/- 1.7 when the teacher was present and 5.5 +/- 3.0 when not present (p = 0.045). This study also analyzed specific use of VR for abscess incision, suturing and insertion of a suprapubic catheter. DISCUSSION: When a teacher was present VR added value to teaching and the usefulness and usability of VR was experienced more positively. The student should also have adequate knowledge of the subject to be taught before VR training. CONCLUSION(S): VR adds value to teaching, but VR exercises may not completely replace high-quality traditional teaching methods. Consequently, it is important to determine the differences between VR and traditional teaching methods and how to combine these methods in the future.",2022,1-Dec,Medical education online,27(1),,2050345,637465245,,,#3787,Ojala 2022,,
"Long experience with a web-based, interactive, conversational virtual patient case simulation for medical students' evaluation: comparison with oral examination","Oliven, A.; Nave, R.; Baruch, A.","Virtual patients (VP) have been advocated as reliable tools for teaching and evaluating clinical skills and competence. We have developed an internet-based, OSCE-like, conversational VP system designed both for training and assessment of medical students. The system, that encompasses complete patient management from H&P to diagnostic procedures and treatment, has now been used regularly during the clerkship of internal medicine. The present article describes the system and compares assessments undertaken with the VP-system over the last five years, to traditional bed-side oral exams. All students practiced on their own exercise VP cases, while preparing for the final exam. A total of 586 students were evaluated simultaneously with both assessment modalities. The alphaCronbach of the VP exam averaged 0.86. No correlation was found between the grades obtained in the two exams, indicating that the VP exam evaluated different parameters than those assessed by the examiners in the oral examinations. We conclude that a VP system can be utilized as a valid and reliable examination tool. It is also most useful for independent training by students during their ward-based learning, as well as when not studying in classes, wards or clinics, when social distancing is required.",2021,1-Dec,Medical education online,26(1),,1946896,635470614,,,#3801,Oliven 2021,,
Comparison of immersive and non-immersive virtual reality videos as substitute for in-hospital teaching during coronavirus lockdown: a survey with graduate medical students in Germany,"Omlor, A. J.; Schwarzel, L. S.; Bewarder, M.; Casper, M.; Damm, E.; Danziger, G.; Mahfoud, F.; Rentz, K.; Sester, U.; Bals, R.; Lepper, P. M.","As a consequence of the continued Covid-19 lockdown in Germany, in-hospital teaching for medical students was impossible. While lectures and other theoretical training were relatively easily converted into online sessions using platforms such as Moodle, Zoom and Microsoft Teams, this was not the case for practical skills and clinical interventions, such as bronchoscopy or colonoscopy. This study describes a workaround that was implemented at the Saarland University Hospital utilizing virtual reality equipment to convey the impressions of shadowing clinical procedures to the students without physical presence. To achieve this, 3D 180degree videos of key clinical interventions of various internal medicine specialities were recorded, cut, and censored. The videos were uploaded to the e-learning YouTube channel of our institution and shared with the students via the private share function. The students could choose whether to use a VR-viewer to watch the videos immersively or to watch them without a viewer on a screen non-immersively. At the end of the course after 1 week, the students completed a questionnaire anonymously focusing on learning-success regarding the presented topics, a self-assessment, and an evaluation of the course. A total of 27 students watched the videos with a VR-Viewer and 74 watched non-immersively. Although the VR-viewer group self-assessed their expertise higher, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the learning-success test score. However, students in the VR-viewer group rated the learning atmosphere, comprehensibility, and overall recommendation of the course significantly higher. They also agreed significantly more to the statement, that they gained a better conception of the presented procedures, and that virtual reality might be an appropriate tool for online teaching.

Virtual reality as a Learning Tool for Improving Infection Control Procedures,"Omori, K.; Shigemoto, N.; Kitagawa, H.; Nomura, T.; Kaiki, Y.; Miyaji, K.; Akita, T.; Kobayashi, T.; Hattori, M.; Hasunuma, N.; Tanaka, J.; Ohge, H.","BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene and donning personal protective equipment (PPE) are essential techniques for infection control; however, low compliance is an issue. The effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) in learning infection-control procedures is unknown. METHOD(S): To verify the effectiveness of VR, medical students were categorized into VR or lecture groups (n=21 each). Each group was given the same curricular content; one group received the training through VR learning using a fully-immersive 360-degree video and the other was conventional lecture-style learning. Before and after the training, they were evaluated for the implementation of hand hygiene and PPE using an Objective Structured Clinical Examination method. Post-test questionnaires were administered. RESULT(S): The scores for hand hygiene, donning PPE, and the total score increased after learning in both groups. There was no difference between the pre-test total scores of the two groups (7 [5-9] vs. 6 [5-7.5], p=0.352); however, the VR group had significantly higher post-test total scores than the lecture group (12 [9.5-12] vs. 9 [8-12], p=0.024). More students in the VR group responded that they enjoyed the training and would like to use the same learning method next time. CONCLUSION(S): VR can be a useful tool for learning and practicing appropriate infection-control procedures. Copyright © 2022.

Does Virtual Reality Improve Procedural Completion and Accuracy in an Intramedullary Tibial Nail Procedure? A Randomized Control Trial,"Orland, M. D.; Patetta, M. J.; Wieser, M.; Kayupov, E.; Gonzalez, M. H.","BackgroundArtificial reality technologies are currently being explored as potential options to improve surgical education. Previous studies have primarily examined the efficacy of artificial reality in laparoscopic procedures, but to our knowledge, none have been performed in orthopaedically relevant procedures such as intramedullary tibial nailing, which calls for more versatile large-scale movements.Questions/purposesDoes a virtual reality simulator with or without a standard technique guide result in (1) a higher proportion of participants who completed the insertion of an intramedullary tibial nail in a synthetic bones model and (2) greater procedural accuracy than does training with a technique guide alone?MethodsTwenty-five first- and second-year medical students without prior exposure to intramedullary tibial nail insertion were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to the technique guide control group (n = 8), the virtual reality group (n = 8), or the virtual reality and technique guide group (n = 9). The technique guide was adapted from a commercially available technique guide, which participants in the assigned groups could use to prepare as much as desired. The virtual reality simulation was based on the same procedure, and we used a commercially available virtual reality simulator that we purchased for this task. Participants in the virtual reality experimental groups completed the simulation on three separate sessions, at a set interval of 3 to 4 days apart. After 10 to 14 days of preparation, all participants attempted to insert an intramedullary nail into an intact, compact bone-model tibia that lacked surrounding soft tissue. Participants were given written hints if requested, but no other assistance was given. A procedure was considered complete if the nail and screw were properly placed. Procedural accuracy was defined as the number of incorrect steps normalized out of the 16 possible performed. After the procedure, one orthopaedic surgeon assessed a blinded video of the participant performing it so the assessor could not recognize the individual or that individual's gender. Additionally, the assessor was unaware of which group each participant had been randomized to during the evaluation.ResultsA higher proportion of participants in the virtual reality group (6 of 8) and the virtual reality and technique guide group (7 of 9) completed the intramedullary nail than did participants in the technique guide group (2 of 8; p = 0.01). There was no difference in completion between the virtual reality groups (p = 0.89). Participants in the virtual reality and virtual reality and technique guide had fewer normalized incorrect steps than did participants in the technique guide group (3.2 +/- 0.1 of 16 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 of 16 versus 5.7 +/- 0.2 of 16, respectively; p = 0.02 for comparisons of virtual reality groups to technique guide, p = 0.63 between the virtual reality group).ConclusionsVirtual reality increased both procedural accuracy and the completion proportion compared with a technique guide in medical students. Based on our findings, virtual reality may help residents learn the procedural workflow and movements required to perform surgical procedures. Future studies should examine how and when exactly the technology can be applied to residencies and its impact on residents.Level of EvidenceLevel I, therapeutic study.

This study aims to give an overview of different types of virtual-reality simulators for use in abdominal diagnostic ultrasound training in radiology. Fifteen specialized radiologists and radiological residents were presented with two similar cases on four different simulators for abdominal ultrasound training. A feedback sheet for each individual simulator and for an overall comparison was filled out by all participants. All means of scores were compared, and simulators were ranked from least to most favorable. One simulator was ranked most favorable in seven out of nine questions, but none of the mean scores had statistically significant differences. All simulators were recommended for training radiologists, and all simulators were perceived to benefit trainees more than experienced ultra-sonographers. Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

Baseline characteristics in laparoscopic simulator performance: The impact of personal computer (PC)-gaming experience and visuospatial ability,"Oussi, N.; Renman, P.; Georgiou, K.; Enochsson, L.","Background: Learning via simulators is under constant development, and it is important to further optimize simulator training curricula. This study investigates the impact of personal computer-gaming experience, visuospatial skills, and repetitive training on laparoscopic simulator performance and specifically on the constituent parameters of the simulator score. Method(s): Forty-seven medical students completed 3 consecutive Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality simulator trials. Previously, they performed a visuospatial test and completed a questionnaire regarding baseline characteristics and personal computer-gaming experience. Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between simulator performance and type of personal computer-gaming experience and visuospatial ability. Result(s): During the first 2 Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality simulation tasks, there was an association between personal computer-gaming experience and the coordination parameters of the score (eg, EconDiath task 1: P = .0047; EconDiath task 2: P = .0102; EconDiath task 3: P = .0836). The type of game category played seemed to have an impact on the coordination parameters (eg, EconDiath task 1-3 for sport games versus no-sport games: P = .01, P = .0013, and P = .01, respectively). In the first Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer task, visuospatial ability correlated with Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer simulator performance but was abolished with repetitive training (overall Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer score task 1-3: P = .0122, P = .0991, and P = .3506, respectively). Sex-specific differences were noted initially but were abolished with training. Conclusion(s): Sport games versus no-sport games demonstrated a significantly better Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer performance. Furthermore, repetitive laparoscopic simulator training may compensate for a previous lack of personal computer-gaming experience, low visuospatial ability, and sex differences.

Setting Two tertiary teaching hospitals. Participants Obstetrics and gynaecology residents postgraduate year 1 to 6 (n = 59) from several European countries. Results Subjects (n = 59) were divided into 2 groups based on laparoscopic experience: Group A (n = 38) and Group B (n = 21). The realism of different aspects of the game received mean scores around 3 on a 5-point Likert scale. The hand-eye coordination was regarded most useful for training with a mean of 3.92 (standard deviation 0.93) and the game was considered most suitable for residents in the first part of their postgraduate training with a mean of 3.73 (standard deviation 0.97). Both groups differed especially concerning their opinion of the usefulness of the game as a training tool. Conclusions Most residents liked the new serious game for the Nintendo Wii-U.

The responses of medical general practitioners to unreasonable patient demand for antibiotics - A study of medical ethics using immersive virtual reality,"Pan, X.; Slater, M.; Beacco, A.; Navarro, X.; Rivas, A. I. B.; Swapp, D.; Hale, J.; Forbes, P. A. G.; Denvir, C.; Hamilton, A. F. D. C.; Delacroix, S.","Background: Dealing with insistent patient demand for antibiotics is an all too common part of a General Practitioner's daily routine. This study explores the extent to which portable Immersive Virtual Reality technology can help us gain an accurate understanding of the factors that influence a doctor's response to the ethical challenge underlying such tenacious requests for antibiotics (given the threat posed by growing anti-bacterial resistance worldwide). It also considers the potential of such technology to train doctors to face such dilemmas. Experiment: Twelve experienced GPs and nine trainees were confronted with an increasingly angry demand by a woman to prescribe antibiotics to her mother in the face of inconclusive evidence that such antibiotic prescription is necessary. The daughter and mother were virtual characters displayed in immersive virtual reality. The specific purposes of the study were twofold: first, whether experienced GPs would be more resistant to patient demands than the trainees, and second, to investigate whether medical doctors would take the virtual situation seriously. Result(s): Eight out of the 9 trainees prescribed the antibiotics, whereas 7 out of the 12 GPs did so. On the basis of a Bayesian analysis, these results yield reasonable statistical evidence in favor of the notion that experienced GPs are more likely to withstand the pressure to prescribe antibiotics than trainee doctors, thus answering our first question positively. As for the second question, a post experience questionnaire assessing the participants' level of presence (together with participants' feedback and body language) suggested that overall participants did tend towards the illusion of being in the consultation room depicted in the virtual reality and that the virtual consultation taking place was really happening.

Hysteroscopic resection on virtual reality simulator: What do we measure?,"Panel, P.; Neveu, M. E.; Villain, C.; Debras, F.; Fernandez, H.; Debras, E.","Objective: The objective was to compare results of two groups of population (novices and experts) on a virtual reality simulator of hysteroscopy resection for different metrics and for a multimetric score to assess its construct validity. Material(s) and Method(s): Nineteen gynecologist who had at least 5 years of experience with hysteroscopy and self-evaluated their expertise at 4/5 or 5/5 were included as expert population. Twenty first-year gynecology residents in Paris were included as novice population. A standardized set of 4 hysteroscopy resection cases (polypectomy, myomectomy, roller ball endometrial ablation and septum resection) was performed on a virtual reality simulator (HystSimTM) by the group of novices and experts. Results obtained on the simulator for overall score and for the parameters were compared by applying the Mann-Whitney test. Result(s): Overall score of novices and experts were significantly different for three resection cases (polypectomy P < 0.001, myomectomy P < 0.001, roller ball endometrial ablation <0.001). The overall score was not different in the septum resection (P = 0.456). For the four cases, the economy score (included cumulative path length, procedure time and camera alignment) were statistically different between novices and experts (polypectomy P < 0.001, myomectomy P = 0.001, roller ball endometrial ablation P < 0.001, septum resection P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The overall score on HystSimTM was able to discriminate novices between experts on polypectomy, myomectomy and roller ball endometrial ablation cases but not on septum resection. The economy score was the more reliable to reflect the surgeon experience. It could be used to evaluate and to train students on hysteroscopic resection on a virtual reality simulator.

HoloMentor: A Novel Mixed Reality Surgical Anatomy Curriculum for Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy,"Papalois, Z. A.; Aydln, A.; Khan, A.; Mazaris, E.; Rathnasamy Muthusamy, A. S.; Dor, F. J. M. F.; Dasgupta, P.; Ahmed, K.","Objectives: The disruption to surgical training and medical education caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for realistic, reliable, and engaging educational opportunities available outside of the operating theatre and accessible for trainees of all levels. This article presents the design and development of a virtual reality curriculum which simulates the surgical mentorship experience outside of the operating theatre, with a focus on surgical anatomy and surgical decision-making. Method(s): This was a multi-institutional study between London's King's College and Imperial College. The index procedure selected for the module was robotic radical prostatectomy. For each stage of the surgical procedure, subject-matter experts (N = 3) at King's College London, identified (1) the critical surgical-decision making points, (2) critical anatomical landmarks, and (3) tips and techniques for overcoming intraoperative challenges. Content validity was determined by an independent panel of subject-matter experts (N = 8) at Imperial College, London, using Fleiss' kappa statistic. The experts' teaching points were combined with operative footage and illustrative animations, and projected onto a virtual reality headset. The module was piloted to surgical science students (N = 15). Quantitative analysis compared participants' confidence regarding their anatomical knowledge before and after taking the module. Qualitative data were gathered from students regarding their views on using the virtual reality model. Result(s): Multi-rater agreement between experts was above the 70.0% threshold for all steps of the procedure. Seventy-three percentage of pilot study participants ""agreed""or ""strongly agreed""that they achieved a better understanding of surgical anatomy and the rationale behind each procedural step.

Pilot Assessment of Immersive Virtual Reality Renal Models as an Educational and Preoperative Planning Tool for Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy,"Parkhomenko, E.; O'Leary, M.; Safiullah, S.; Walia, S.; Owyong, M.; Lin, C.; James, R.; Okhunov, Z.; Patel, R. M.; Kaler, K. S.; Landman, J.; Clayman, R.","Background: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) requires the urologist to have detailed knowledge of the stone and its relationship with the renal anatomy. Immersive virtual reality (iVR) provides patient-specific three-dimensional models that might be beneficial in this regard. Our objective is to present the initial experience with iVR in surgeon planning and patient preoperative education for PCNL. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2017 to 2018 four surgeons, each of whom had varying expertise in PCNL, used iVR models to acquaint themselves with the renal anatomy before PCNL among 25 patients. iVR renderings were also viewed by patients using the same head-mounted Oculus rift display. Surgeons rated their understanding of the anatomy with CT alone and then after CT+iVR; patients also recorded their experience with iVR. To assess the impact on outcomes, the 25 iVR study patients were compared with 25 retrospective matched-paired non-iVR patients. Student's t-test was used to analyze collected data. Result(s): iVR improved surgeons' understanding of the optimal calix of entry and the stone's location, size, and orientation (p < 0.01). iVR altered the surgical approach in 10 (40%) cases. Patients strongly agreed that iVR improved their understanding of their stone disease and reduced their preoperative anxiety. In the retrospective matched-paired analysis, the iVR group had a statistically significant decrease in fluoroscopy time and blood loss as well as a trend toward fewer nephrostomy tracts and a higher stone-free rate. Conclusion(s): iVR improved urologists' understanding of the renal anatomy and altered the operative approach in 40% of cases. In addition, iVR improved patient comprehension of their surgery. Clinically, iVR had benefits with regard to decreased fluoroscopy time and less blood loss along with a trend toward fewer access tracts and higher stone-free rates.

Stereoscopic virtual reality does not improve knowledge acquisition of congenital heart disease,"Patel, N.; Costa, A.; Sanders, S. P.; Ezon, D.","Advances in virtual reality have made it possible for clinicians and trainees to interact with 3D renderings of hearts with congenital heart disease in 3D stereoscopic vision. No study to date has assessed whether this technology improved instruction compared to standard 2D interfaces. The purpose of this study was to assess whether stereoscopic virtual reality improves congenital heart disease anatomy education. Subjects in a prospective, blinded, randomized trial completed a pre-test assessing factual and visuospatial knowledge of common atrioventricular canal and were randomized to an intervention or control group based on their score. The intervention group used a 3D virtual reality (VR) headset to visualize a lecture with 3D heart models while the control group used a desktop (DT) computer interface with the same models. Subjects took a post-test and provided subjective feedback. 51 subjects were enrolled, 24 in the VR group & 27 in the DT group. The median score difference for VR subjects was 12 (IQR 9-13.3), compared to 10 (IQR 7.5-12) in the DT group. No difference in score improvement was found (p = 0.11). VR subjects' impression of the ease of use of their interface was higher than DT subjects (median 8 vs 7, respectively, p = 0.01). VR subjects' impression of their understanding of the subject matter was higher than desktop subjects (median 7 vs 5, respectively, p = 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the knowledge acquisition observed between the stereoscopic virtual reality group and the monoscopic desktop-based group. Participants in virtual reality reported a better learning experience and self-assessment suggesting virtual reality may increase learner engagement in understanding congenital heart disease.

This study proposes and validates a method for workspace configuration of a surgical simulator which utilizes a haptic device for interaction with a virtual model and a bench model to provide additional tactile feedback based on planned surgical manoeuvers. Numerical analyses were completed to determine the workspace and position of a haptic device, relative to the bench model, used in the surgical simulator, and the determined configuration was validated using device limitations and user data from surgical and nonsurgical users. For the validation, surgeons performed an identical surgery on a cadaver prior to using the simulator, and their trajectories were then compared to the determined workspace for the haptic device. The configuration of the simulator was determined appropriate through workspace analysis and the collected user trajectories. Statistical analyses suggest differences in trajectories between the participating surgeons which were not affected by the imposed haptic workspace. This study, therefore, demonstrates a method to optimally position a haptic device with respect to a bench model while meeting the manoeuverability needs of a surgical procedure. The validation method identified workspace position and user trajectory towards ideal configuration of a mixed reality simulator.

The use of head-mounted display eyeglasses for teaching surgical skills: A prospective randomised study,"Peden, R. G.; Mercer, R.; Tatham, A. J.","Purpose To investigate whether 'surgeon's eye view' videos provided via head-mounted displays can improve skill acquisition and satisfaction in basic surgical training compared with conventional wet-lab teaching. Methods A prospective randomised study of 14 medical students with no prior suturing experience, randomised to 3 groups: 1) conventional teaching; 2) head-mounted display-assisted teaching and 3) head-mounted display self-learning. All were instructed in interrupted suturing followed by 15 minutes' practice. Head-mounted displays provided a 'surgeon's eye view' video demonstrating the technique, available during practice. Subsequently students undertook a practical assessment, where suturing was videoed and graded by masked assessors using a 10-point surgical skill score (1 = very poor technique, 10 = very good technique). Students completed a questionnaire assessing confidence and satisfaction. Results Suturing ability after teaching was similar between groups (P = 0.229, Kruskal-Wallis test). Median surgical skill scores were 7.5 (range 6-10), 6 (range 3-8) and 7 (range 1-7) following head-mounted display-assisted teaching, conventional teaching, and head-mounted display self-learning respectively. There was good agreement between graders regarding surgical skill scores (rho.c = 0.599, r = 0.603), and no difference in number of sutures placed between groups (P = 0.120). The head-mounted display-assisted teaching group reported greater enjoyment than those attending conventional teaching (P = 0.033). Head-mounted display self-learning was regarded as least useful (7.4 vs 9.0 for conventional teaching, P = 0.021), but more enjoyable than conventional teaching (9.6 vs 8.0, P = 0.050). Conclusions Teaching augmented with head-mounted displays was significantly more enjoyable than conventional teaching. Students undertaking self-directed learning using head-mounted displays with pre-recorded videos had comparable skill acquisition to those attending traditional wet-lab tutorials.

Impact of Virtual Dementia Tour on empathy level of nursing students: A quasi-experimental study,"Peng, X.; Wu, L.; Xie, X.; Dai, M.; Wang, D.","Objective: As a developable ability, empathy is significantly associated with patient-centered care. The authors intended to evaluate the effect of Virtual Dementia Tour (VDT) upon nursing students' empathy level and propose practical rationales for optimizing future dementia care. Method(s): A total of 45 second-year undergraduate nursing students were organized to watch a theme movie entitled Still Alice and participate in an 8-min VDT. Jefferson Scale of Empathy-Health Professional Students (JSE-HPS) was employed for evaluating the empathy level of nursing students. After VDT, all nursing students participated in a structured interview. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were performed using SPSS 24.0. Result(s): Their empathy levels demonstrated significant overall improvements (106.69 +/- 9.49 vs 115.51 +/- 10.16, P < 0.01). During the course of VDT, nursing students experienced varying levels of anxiety and frustration. All of them were satisfied with the program since they had gained a deeper understanding of demented patients and the program could change their attitudes toward demented elders. Conclusion(s): Watching a specially selected movie and participating in VDT may be an effective method for enhancing empathy and caring during nursing student education.

Training Surgical Residents With a Haptic Robotic Central Venous Catheterization Simulator,"Pepley, D. F.; Gordon, A. B.; Yovanoff, M. A.; Mirkin, K. A.; Miller, S. R.; Han, D. C.; Moore, J. Z.","Ojective Ultrasound guided central venous catheterization (CVC) is a common surgical procedure with complication rates ranging from 5 to 21 percent. Training is typically performed using manikins that do not simulate anatomical variations such as obesity and abnormal vessel positioning. The goal of this study was to develop and validate the effectiveness of a new virtual reality and force haptic based simulation platform for CVC of the right internal jugular vein. Design A CVC simulation platform was developed using a haptic robotic arm, 3D position tracker, and computer visualization. The haptic robotic arm simulated needle insertion force that was based on cadaver experiments. The 3D position tracker was used as a mock ultrasound device with realistic visualization on a computer screen. Upon completion of a practice simulation, performance feedback is given to the user through a graphical user interface including scoring factors based on good CVC practice. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated by training 13 first year surgical residents using the virtual reality haptic based training system over a 3 month period. Results The participants' performance increased from 52% to 96% on the baseline training scenario, approaching the average score of an expert surgeon: 98%. This also resulted in improvement in positive CVC practices including a 61% decrease between final needle tip position and vein center, a decrease in mean insertion attempts from 1.92 to 1.23, and a 12% increase in time spent aspirating the syringe throughout the procedure. Conclusions A virtual reality haptic robotic simulator for CVC was successfully developed. Surgical residents training on the simulation improved to near expert levels after three robotic training sessions. This suggests that this system could act as an effective training device for CVC.

Application field of VOXEL-MAN Tempo 3D virtual reality simulator in surgery of pars petrosa of temporal bone. [Hungarian],"Perenyi, A.; Posta, B.; Szabo, L.; Tobias, Z.; Dimak, B.; Nagy, R.; Jonas, G.; Bere, Z.; Kiss, J. G.; Rovo, L.; Csanady, M.","Introduction: The pars petrosa of the human temporal bone is a structure of complex and diverse anatomy. Prior to surgical interventions, in order to prevent surgical complications, it is essential to acquire sound anatomical knowledge and dexterity as well as to practice each surgical step and movement. The VOXEL-MAN Tempo 3D simulator uses virtual reality and robotics to provide an opportunity to practice. Objective(s): In 2019, the University of Szeged installed a VOXEL-MAN Virtual Reality simulator at the Medical Skills Development Center. After learning about the VOXEL-MAN Tempo simulator, the authors present the device and articulate their need for interventions with the simulator. Method(s): The VOXEL-MAN Tempo simulator is evaluated according to the formulated criteria and the role assigned to it in the practical training is determined. Result(s): The simulator shows the anatomical structure of the temporal bone virtually, yet realistically, the real spatial location of the important anatomical structures and their distance from each other and from the surgical instrument. The system allows ear surgery to be performed realistically (two-handed bone work with a drill and suction) with tactile (vibration) and visual (bleeding) feedback. One can improve surgical skills with one- or two-handed tasks. Bone work in ear surgeries can be performed in a reproducible manner from routine, high-resolution computer tomography of the temporal bone of a real patient. Conclusion(s): With reference to our experience, the simulator is excellent for practicing each surgical step. In the future, we intend to use this virtual system in undergraduate and postgraduate training in otolaryngology. Copyright © 2021 Akademiai Kiado Rt..

Resuscitating cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in a virtual reality: Prospective interventional study,"Perron, J. E.; Coffey, M. J.; Lovell-Simons, A.; Dominguez, L.; King, M. E.; Ooi, C. Y.","Background: Simulation-based technologies are emerging to enhance medical education in the digital era. However, there is limited data for the use of virtual reality simulation in pediatric medical education. We developed Virtual Doc as a highly immersive virtual reality simulation to teach pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills to medical students. Objective(s): The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate participant satisfaction and perceived educational efficacy of Virtual Doc. The secondary aim of this study was to assess the game play features of Virtual Doc. Method(s): We conducted a prospective closed beta-testing study at the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) in 2018. All medical students from the 6-year undergraduate program were eligible to participate and were recruited through voluntary convenience sampling. Participants attended a 1-hour testing session and attempted at least one full resuscitation case using the virtual reality simulator. Following this, participants were asked to complete an anonymous postsession questionnaire. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Result(s): A total of 26 participants were recruited, consented to participate in this study, and attended a 1-hour in-person closed beta-testing session, and 88% (23/26) of participants completed the anonymous questionnaire and were included in this study. Regarding participant satisfaction, Virtual Doc was enjoyed by 91% (21/23) of participants, with 74% (17/23) intending to recommend the simulation to a colleague and 66% (15/23) intending to recommend the simulation to a friend. In assessment of the perceived educational value of Virtual Doc, 70% (16/23) of participants agreed they had an improved understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 78% (18/23) agreed that Virtual Doc will help prepare for and deal with real-life clinical scenarios. Furthermore, 91% (21/23) of participants agreed with the development of additional Virtual Doc cases as beneficial for learning. An evaluation of the game play features as our secondary objective revealed that 70% (16/23) of participants agreed with ease in understanding how to use Virtual Doc, and 74% (17/23) found the game play elements useful in understanding cardiopulmonary resuscitation. One-third (7/23, 30%) found it easy to work with the interactive elements. In addition, 74% (17/23) were interested in interacting with other students within the simulation. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates a positive response regarding trainee satisfaction and perceived educational efficacy of Virtual Doc. The simulation was widely accepted by the majority of users and may have the potential to improve educational learning objectives.

Getting to the Root of Fine Motor Skill Performance in Dentistry: Brain Activity During Dental Tasks in a Virtual Reality Haptic Simulation,"Perry, S.; Bridges, S. M.; Zhu, F.; Leung, W. K.; Burrow, M. F.; Poolton, J.; Masters, R. S.","BACKGROUND: There is little evidence considering the relationship between movement-specific reinvestment (a dimension of personality which refers to the propensity for individuals to consciously monitor and control their movements) and working memory during motor skill performance. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measuring oxyhemoglobin demands in the frontal cortex during performance of virtual reality (VR) psychomotor tasks can be used to examine this research gap. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the potential relationship between the propensity to reinvest and blood flow to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of the brain. A secondary aim was to determine the propensity to reinvest and performance during 2 dental tasks carried out using haptic VR simulators. METHODS: We used fNIRS to assess oxygen demands in 24 undergraduate dental students during 2 dental tasks (clinical, nonclinical) on a VR haptic simulator. We used the Movement-Specific Reinvestment Scale questionnaire to assess the students' propensity to reinvest. RESULTS: Students with a high propensity for movement-specific reinvestment displayed significantly greater oxyhemoglobin demands in an area associated with working memory during the nonclinical task (Spearman correlation, rs=.49, P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This small-scale study suggests that neurophysiological differences are evident between high and low reinvesters during a dental VR task in terms of oxyhemoglobin demands in an area associated with working memory.

Internet Versus Virtual Reality Settings for Genomics Information Provision,"Persky, S.; Kistler, W. D.; Klein, W. M. P.; Ferrer, R. A.","Current models of genomic information provision will be unable to handle large-scale clinical integration of genomic information, as may occur in primary care settings. Therefore, adoption of digital tools for genetic and genomic information provision is anticipated, primarily using Internet-based, distributed approaches. The emerging consumer communication platform of virtual reality (VR) is another potential intermediate approach between face-to-face and distributed Internet platforms to engage in genomics education and information provision. This exploratory study assessed whether provision of genomics information about body weight in a simulated, VR-based consultation (relative to a distributed, Internet platform) would be associated with differences in health behavior-related attitudes and beliefs, and interpersonal reactions to the avatar-physician. We also assessed whether outcomes differed depending upon whether genomic versus lifestyle-oriented information was conveyed. There were significant differences between communication platforms for all health behavior-oriented outcomes. Following communication in the VR setting, participants reported greater self-efficacy, dietary behavioral intentions, and exercise behavioral intentions than in the Internet-based setting. There were no differences in trust of the physician by setting, and no interaction between setting effects and the content of the information. This study was a first attempt to examine the potential capabilities of a VR-based communication setting for conveying genomic content in the context of weight management. There may be benefits to use of VR settings for communication about genomics, as well as more traditional health information, when it comes to influencing the attitudes and beliefs that underlie healthy lifestyle behaviors.",2019,1-Jan,"Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",22(1),,14-Jul,625990792,,,#4013,Persky 2019,,
Mixed-Reality Simulation for a Pediatric Transport Team: A Pilot Study,"Peterson, E.; Porter, M.; Calhoun, A.","Objective: Transport medicine requires a complex set of skills including fast-paced medical decision making, in-depth medical knowledge, procedural competence, interpersonal and communication skills, leadership, and professionalism. There has been a call for more training in these areas. Simulation-based training can be a way to acquire these necessary skills and bridge the gap to higher-quality transport care. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel mixed-reality simulation program to enhance medical and communication skills for a pediatric transport team. Method(s): A mixed-reality simulation program using standardized patients portraying family members and high-fidelity manikins to simulate a medical emergency was developed and implemented for a pediatric transport team. Ten nurses, 9 respiratory therapists, and 8 emergency medical technicians participated. Pre-post self-perceptions of skill and program quality were assessed prospectively. Result(s): Team members rated the overall program quality highly, with a median 5 on a 5-point Likert scale. There was a statistically significant change in pre- versus postprogram self-perceptions of skill in the areas of communication (premedian = 3 vs. postmedian = 4, 5-point Likert scale, P < .001). Conclusion(s): Mixed-reality simulation programs can enhance standard technical skills training by providing an additional relational element. Such programs are translatable to other institutions.

Being present in a real or virtual world: A EEG study,"Petukhov, I. V.; Glazyrin, A. E.; Gorokhov, A. V.; Steshina, L. A.; Tanryverdiev, I. O.","Background and objective: This study proposes an approach to evaluation and measuring of presence for man-machine interaction in the virtual reality based on electroencephalographic data. Material(s) and Method(s): It analyzes stable electroencephalographic patterns that allow us to trace a connection between a brain activity and purposeful actions of an individual in various environments. The subjects of the study were experienced downhill skiers equipped with electroencephalographs, who performed real-life skiing on a downhill course, after which they were offered a virtual simulation of downhill skiing using an HTCVive headset and a programmed 2D or desktop simulator. Result(s): The results of measurement showed neuropatterns similar in the cases of virtual reality simulation and physical downhill skiing (in part of changes in space and power parameters of electroencephalograms in the different frequency ranges) and different from a 2D simulator. This observation enables us to make an assumption of realism of a virtual reality simulator in the context of reproduction of the subjects' similar cognitive and semantic connections and motor programs. Discussion(s): Further research work will focus on evaluation of efficiency in performing psychophysiological tests (time response to a mobile object) in the virtual reality and 2D desktop application.

Effect of Preoperative Warm-up Exercise before Laparoscopic Gynecological Surgery: A Randomized Trial,"Polterauer, S.; Husslein, H.; Kranawetter, M.; Schwameis, R.; Reinthaller, A.; Heinze, G.; Grimm, C.","Background Laparoscopic surgical procedures require a high level of cognitive and psychomotoric skills. Thus, effective training methods to acquire an adequate level of expertise are crucial. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of preoperative warm up training on surgeon's performance during gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. Materials and Methods In this randomized controlled trial, surgeons performed a preoperative warm up training using a virtual reality simulator before laparoscopic unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Serving as their own controls, each subject performed 2 pairs of laparoscopic cases, each pair consisting of 1 case with and 1 without warm up before surgery. Surgeries were videotaped and psychomotoric skills were rated using objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) and the generic error rating tool by a masked observer. Perioperative complications were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using a mixed model, and mean OSATS scores were compared between both the groups. Results In total, data of 10 surgeons and 17 surgeries were available for analysis. No differences between educational level and surgical experiences were observed between the groups. Mean standard error psychomotoric and task-specific OSATS scores of 19.8 (1.7) and 3.7 (0.2) were observed in the warm up group compared with 18.6 (1.7) and 3.8 (0.2) in the no warm up group, respectively (p = 0.51 and p = 0.29). Using generic error rating tool, the total number of errors was 8.75 (2.15) in the warm up group compared with 10.8 (2.18) in the no warm-up group (p = 0.53). Perioperative complications and operating time did not differ between both the groups. Discussion The present study suggests that warm-up before laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy does not increase psychomotoric skills during surgery. Moreover, it does not influence operating time and complication rates. (Medical University of Vienna-IRB approval number, 1072/2011, ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01712607).

The Simulation Training in Coronary Angiography and Its Impact on Real Life Conduct in the Catheterization Laboratory,"Popovic, B.; Pinelli, S.; Albuisson, E.; Metzdorf, P. A.; Mourer, B.; Tran, N.; Camenzind, E.","Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mentored simulation training (ST) in coronary angiography and to assess the transferability of acquired skills from virtual reality to the real world. Twenty cardiology residents were randomized to ST or control before performing real-life cases in the catheterization laboratory. The control group underwent secondary ST and reperformed real-life cases in the catheterization laboratory. Skill metrics were compared between the ST and the control group, and within the control group between before and after ST. In real-life cases, the procedure time was shorter (p = 0.002), the radiation dose lower (p = 0.001), and the global procedure skill score was higher (p = 0.0001) in the ST group as compared with the control (before ST) group. During virtual ST procedural time (p <0.001), fluoroscopic time (p <0.001), training contrast amount (p <0.001), and global training score (p <0.001) significantly decreased. In the control group, all monitoring procedure parameters were significantly improved after ST, as well as, the global procedure flow score (p <0.0001). In conclusion, simulator-based training in coronary angiography improved operator skills compared with traditional in catheterization laboratory mentor-based training. ST should be incorporated in the curriculum of the interventionalist to improve learning in coronary angiography.

Virtual reality training compared with apprenticeship training in laparoscopic surgery: a meta-analysis,"Portelli, M.; Bianco, S. F.; Bezzina, T.; Abela, J. E.","INTRODUCTION: Since its inception, laparoscopic surgery has evolved and new techniques have been developed due to technological advances. This requires a different and more complex skill set in comparison with open surgery. Reduced working hours, less training time and patient safety factors demand that such skills need to be achieved outside the operating theatre environment. Several studies have been published and have determined the effectiveness of virtual reality training. We aimed to compare virtual reality training with the traditional apprenticeship method of training and determine whether it can supplement or replace the traditional apprenticeship model. We also aimed to perform a meta-analysis of the literature and develop conclusions with respect to the benefits achieved by adding virtual reality training on a regular basis to surgical training programmes. METHOD(S): A literature search was carried out on PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar academic search engines using the MESH terms 'randomised controlled trials', 'virtual reality', 'laparoscopy', 'surgical education' and 'surgical training'. All randomised controlled trials published to January 2018 comparing virtual reality training to apprenticeship training were included. Data were collected on improved dexterity, operative performance and operating times. Each outcome was calculated with 95% confidence intervals and with intention-to-treat analysis; 24 randomised controlled trials were analysed. FINDINGS: Meta-analytical data were extracted for time, path length, instrument handling, tissue handling, error scores and objective structure assessment of technical skills scoring. There was significant improvement in individual trainee skill in all meta-analyses (p < 0.0002).

M.","Background. The purpose of this study was to examine the face and construct validity of a custom-developed bimanual laparoscopic force-skills trainer with haptics feedback. The study also examined the effect of handedness on fundamental and complex tasks. Methods. Residents (n = 25) and surgeons (n = 25) performed virtual reality-based bimanual fundamental and complex tasks. Tool-tissue reaction forces were summed, recorded, and analysed. Seven different force-based measures and a 1-time measure were used as metrics. Subsequently, participants filled out face validity and demographic questionnaires. Results. Residents and surgeons were positive on the design, workspace, and usefulness of the simulator. Construct validity results showed significant differences between residents and experts during the execution of fundamental and complex tasks. In both tasks, residents applied large forces with higher coefficient of variation and force jerks (P <.001). Experts, with their dominant hand, applied lower forces in complex tasks and higher forces in fundamental tasks (P <.001). The coefficients of force variation (CoV) of residents and experts were higher in complex tasks (P <.001). Strong correlations were observed between CoV and task time for fundamental (r = 0.70) and complex tasks (r = 0.85). Range of smoothness of force was higher for the non-dominant hand in both fundamental and complex tasks. Conclusions. The simulator was able to differentiate the force-skills of residents and surgeons, and objectively evaluate the effects of handedness on laparoscopic force-skills. Competency-based laparoscopic skills assessment curriculum should be updated to meet the requirements of bimanual force-based training.

An innovative virtual reality training tool for orthognathic surgery,"Pulijala, Y.; Ma, M.; Pears, M.; Peebles, D.; Ayoub, A.","Virtual reality (VR) surgery using Oculus Rift and Leap Motion devices is a multi-sensory, holistic surgical training experience. A multimedia combination including 360degree videos, three-dimensional interaction, and stereoscopic videos in VR has been developed to enable trainees to experience a realistic surgery environment. The innovation allows trainees to interact with the individual components of the maxillofacial anatomy and apply surgical instruments while watching close-up stereoscopic three-dimensional videos of the surgery. In this study, a novel training tool for Le Fort I osteotomy based on immersive virtual reality (iVR) was developed and validated. Seven consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeons evaluated the application for face and content validity. Using a structured assessment process, the surgeons commented on the content of the developed training tool, its realism and usability, and the applicability of VR surgery for orthognathic surgical training. The results confirmed the clinical applicability of VR for delivering training in orthognathic surgery. Modifications were suggested to improve the user experience and interactions with the surgical instruments. This training tool is ready for testing with surgical trainees.

Effectiveness of Immersive Virtual Reality in Surgical Training-A Randomized Control Trial,"Pulijala, Y.; Ma, M.; Pears, M.; Peebles, D.; Ayoub, A.","Purpose: Surgical training methods are evolving with the technological advancements, including the application of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality. However, 28 to 40% of novice residents are not confident in performing a major surgical procedure. VR surgery, an immersive VR (iVR) experience, was developed using Oculus Rift and Leap Motion devices (Leap Motion, Inc, San Francisco, CA) to address this challenge. Our iVR is a multisensory, holistic surgical training application that demonstrates a maxillofacial surgical technique, the Le Fort I osteotomy. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of using VR surgery on the self-confidence and knowledge of surgical residents. Material(s) and Method(s): A multisite, single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed. The participants were novice surgical residents with limited experience in performing the Le Fort I osteotomy. The primary outcome measures were the self-assessment scores of trainee confidence using a Likert scale and an objective assessment of the cognitive skills. Ninety-five residents from 7 dental schools were included in the RCT. The participants were randomly divided into a study group of 51 residents and a control group of 44. Participants in the study group used the VR surgery application on an Oculus Rift with Leap Motion device. The control group participants used similar content in a standard PowerPoint presentation on a laptop. Repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was applied to the data to assess the overall effect of the intervention on the confidence of the residents. Result(s): The study group participants showed significantly greater perceived self-confidence levels compared with those in the control group (P =.034; alpha = 0.05). Novices in the first year of their training showed the greatest improvement in their confidence compared with those in their second and third year.

Virtual interactive suturing for the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS),"Qi, D.; Panneerselvam, K.; Ahn, W.; Arikatla, V.; Enquobahrie, A.; De, S.","Background Suturing with intracorporeal knot-tying is one of the five tasks of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS), which is a pre-requisite for board certification in general surgery. This task involves placing a short suture through two marks in a penrose drain and then tying a double-throw knot followed by two single-throw knots using two needle graspers operated by both hands. A virtual basic laparoscopic skill trainer (VBLaST©) is being developed to represent the virtual versions of the FLS tasks, including automated, real time performance measurement and feedback. In this paper, we present the development of a VBLaST suturing simulator (VBLaST-SS©). Developing such a simulator involves solving multiple challenges associated with fast collision detection, response and force feedback. Methods In this paper, we present a novel projection-intersection based knot detection method, which can identify the validity of different types of knots at haptic update rates. A simple and robust edge-edge based collision detection algorithm is introduced to support interactive knot tying and needle insertion operations. A bimanual hardware interface integrates actual surgical instruments with haptic devices enabling not only interactive rendering of force feedback but also realistic sensation of needle grasping, which realizes an immersive surgical suturing environment. Results Experiments on performing the FLS intracorporeal suturing task show that the simulator is able to run on a standard personal computer at interactive rates. Conclusions VBLaST-SS© is a computer-based interactive virtual simulation system for FLS intracorporeal knot-tying suturing task that can provide real-time objective assessment for the user's performance.

Surgeons With Five or More Actual Cricothyrotomies Perform Significantly Better on a VR Simulator,"Qi, D.; Petrusa, E.; Kruger, U.; Milef, N.; Abu-Nuwar, M. R.; Haque, M.; Lim, R.; Jones, D. B.; Turkseven, M.; Demirel, D.; Halic, T.; De, S.; Saillant, N.","Background: Discriminating performance of learners with varying experience is essential to developing and validating a surgical simulator. For rare and emergent procedures such as cricothyrotomy (CCT), the criteria to establish such groups are unclear. This study is to investigate the impact of surgeons' actual CCT experience on their virtual reality simulator performance and to determine the minimum number of actual CCTs that significantly discriminates simulator scores. Our hypothesis is that surgeons who performed more actual CCT cases would perform better on a virtual reality CCT simulator. Method(s): 47 clinicians were recruited to participate in this study at the 2018 annual conference of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons. We established groups based on three different experience thresholds, that is, the minimal number of CCT cases performed (1, 5, and 10), and compared simulator performance between these groups. Result(s): Participants who had performed more clinical cases manifested higher mean scores in completing CCT simulation tasks, and those reporting at least 5 actual CCTs had significantly higher (P = 0.014) simulator scores than those who had performed fewer cases. Another interesting finding was that classifying participants based on experience level, that is, attendings, fellows, and residents, did not yield statistically significant differences in skills related to CCT. Conclusion(s): The simulator was sensitive to prior experience at a threshold of 5 actual CCTs performed.

Virtual reality operating room with AI guidance: design and validation of a fire scenario,"Qi, D.; Ryason, A.; Milef, N.; Alfred, S.; Abu-Nuwar, M. R.; Kappus, M.; De, S.; Jones, D. B.","Background: Operating room (OR) fires are uncommon but disastrous events. Inappropriate handling of OR fires can result in injuries, even death. Aiming to simulate OR fire emergencies and effectively train clinicians to react appropriately, we have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based OR fire virtual trainer based on the principle of the ""fire triangle"" and SAGES FUSE curriculum. The simulator can predict the user's actions in the virtual OR and provide them with timely feedback to assist with training. We conducted a study investigating the validity of the AI-assisted OR fire trainer at the 2019 SAGES Learning Center. Method(s): Fifty-three participants with varying medical experience were voluntarily recruited to participate in our Institutional Review Board approved study. All participants were asked to contain a fire within the virtual OR. Participants were then asked to fill out a 7-point Likert questionnaire consisting of ten questions regarding the face validation of the AI-assisted OR fire simulator. Shapiro-Wilk tests were conducted to test normality of the scores for each trial. A Friedman's ANOVA with post hoc tests was used to evaluate the effect of multiple trials on performance. Result(s): On a 7-point scale, eight of the ten questions were rated a mean of 6 or greater (72.73%), especially those relating to the usefulness of the simulator for OR fire-containing training. 79.25% of the participants rated the degree of usefulness of AI guidance over 6 out of 7. The performance of individuals improved significantly over the five trials, chi<sup>2</sup>(4) = 119.89, p <.001, and there was a significant linear trend of performance r =.97, p = 0.006. A pairwise analysis showed that only after the introduction of AI did performance improve significantly. Conclusion(s): The AI-guided OR fire trainer offers the potential to assess OR personnel and teach the proper response to an iatrogenic fire scenario in a safe, repeatable, immersive environment.

Efficacy of a virtual reality-based basic and clinical fused curriculum for clinical education on the lumbar intervertebral disc,"Qi, F.; Gan, Y.; Wang, S.; Tie, Y.; Chen, J.; Li, C.","OBJECTIVE: Today, minimally invasive procedures have become mainstream surgical procedures. Percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) requires profound knowledge of the laparoscopic lumbar anatomy. Immersive virtual reality (VR) provides three-dimensional patient-specific models to help in the process of preclinical surgical preparation. In this study, the authors investigated the efficacy of VR application in LDH for training orthopedic residents and postgraduates. METHOD(S): VR images of the lumbar anatomy were created with immersive VR and mAnatomy software. The study was conducted among 60 residents and postgraduates. A questionnaire was developed to assess the effect of and satisfaction with this VR-based basic and clinical fused curriculum. The teaching effect was also evaluated through a postlecture test, and the results of the prelecture surgical examination were taken as baselines. RESULT(S): All participants in the VR group agreed that VR-based education is practical, attractive, and easy to operate, compared to traditional teaching, and promotes better understanding of the anatomical structures involved in LDH. Learners in the VR group achieved higher scores on an anatomical and clinical fusion test than learners in the traditional group (84.67 +/- 14.56 vs 76.00 +/- 16.10, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): An immersive VR-based basic and clinical fused curriculum can increase residents' and postgraduates' interest and support them in mastering the structural changes and complicated symptoms of LDH.

VolumetricOR: A New Approach to Simulate Surgical Interventions in Virtual Reality for Training and Education,"Queisner, M.; Pogorzhelskiy, M.; Remde, C.; Pratschke, J.; Sauer, I. M.","Background: Surgical training is primarily carried out through observation during assistance or on-site classes, by watching videos as well as by different formats of simulation. The simulation of physical presence in the operating theatre in virtual reality might complement these necessary experiences. A prerequisite is a new education concept for virtual classes that communicates the unique workflows and decision-making paths of surgical health professions (i.e. surgeons, anesthesiologists and surgical assistants) in an authentic and immersive way. For this project, media scientists, designers and surgeons worked together to develop the foundations for new ways of conveying knowledge using virtual reality in surgery. Material(s) and Method(s): A technical workflow to record and present volumetric videos of surgical interventions in a photorealistic virtual operating room was developed. Situated in the virtual reality demonstrator called VolumetricOR, users can experience and navigate through surgical workflows as if they are physically present. The concept is compared with traditional video-based formats of digital simulation in surgical training. Result(s): VolumetricOR let trainees experience surgical action and workflows (a) three-dimensionally, (b) from any perspective and (c) in real scale. This improves the linking of theoretical expertise and practical application of knowledge and shifts the learning experience from observation to participation. Discussion(s): Volumetric training environments allow trainees to acquire procedural knowledge before going to the operating room and could improve the efficiency and quality of the learning and training process for professional staff by communicating techniques and workflows when the possibilities of training on-site are limited.

Teaching basic fiberoptic intubation skills in a simulator: initial learning and skills decay,"K. Latif R; Bautista, A.; Duan, X.; Neamtu, A.; Wu, D.; Wadhwa, A.; Akca, O.","Purpose: Generally, novices are taught fiberoptic intubation on patients by attending anesthesiologists; however, this approach raises patient safety concerns. Patient safety should improve if novice learners are trained for basic skills on simulators. In this educational study, we assessed the time and number of attempts required to train novices in fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic intubation on simulators. Because decay in skills is inevitable, we also assessed fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic intubation skill decay and the amount of effort required to regain fiberoptic bronchoscopy skill. Method(s): First, we established attempt- and duration-based quantitative norms for reaching skill proficiency for fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic intubation by experienced anesthesiologists (n = 8) and prepared an 11-step checklist and a 5-point global rating scale for assessment. Novice learners (n = 15) were trained to reach the established skill proficiency in a Virtual Reality simulator for fiberoptic bronchoscopy skills and a Human Airway Anatomy Simulator for fiberoptic intubation skills. Two months later, novices were reassessed to determine decay in learned skills and the required time to retrain them to fiberoptic bronchoscopy proficiency level. Result(s): Proficiency in fiberoptic bronchoscopy skill level was achieved with 11 +/- 5 attempts and after 658 +/- 351 s. After 2 months without practice, the time taken by the novices to successful fiberoptic bronchoscopy on the Virtual Reality simulator increased from 41 +/- 8 to 68 +/- 31 s (P = 0.0138). Time and attempts required to retrain them were 424 +/- 230 s and 9.1 +/- 4.6 attempts, respectively. Conclusion(s): Novices were successfully trained to proficiency skill level.

Development and Validation of a Virtual Reality Haptic Femoral Nailing Simulator,"Racy, M.; Barrow, A.; Tomlinson, J.; Bello, F.","Objective: To create a virtual reality (VR) femoral nailing simulator combining haptics and image intensifier functionality and then carry out validation studies to assess its educational value. Design(s): The simulator consisted of a 3D virtual environment, a haptic device and 3D printed drill handle and a VR headset. The environment was created using a video game development engine, interfaced with plugins to allow haptic feedback and image intensifier functionality. Two tasks were created within the simulator as part of an antegrade femoral intramedullary (IM) nail procedure: proximal guidewire entry and distal locking.For the validation study, participants performed the above tasks on the simulator. Metrics were collected including time taken, number of X-rays and tool distance travelled and used to assess construct validity. A questionnaire was then completed to assess authenticity and content validity. Setting(s): Simulator development in centre for simulation and engagement science laboratory. Validation study in a teaching hospital environment. Participant(s): Orthopedic specialist trainees and consultants. Result(s): Surgeon experience (number of IM nails performed/postgraduate year) correlated with significantly improved task performance. More experienced surgeons took less time, used fewer X-rays and had greater economy of movement than less experienced surgeons. Authenticity and content validity were well rated, with criticisms primarily due to hardware limitations. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the first orthopedic simulator to combine immersive VR with haptics and full image intensifier functionality. By combining multiple aspects of surgical practice within a single device, we aimed to improve participant immersion and educational value.

J.; Sankaranarayanan, G.; Nagaraj, M. B.; Hogg, M. E.; Zeh, H. J.; Polanco, P. M.","Background: The annual number of robotic surgical procedures is on the rise. Robotic surgery requires unique skills compared to other surgical approaches. Simulation allows basic robot skill acquisition and enhances patient safety. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and transferability of a mastery-based curriculum using a new virtual reality (VR) robotic simulator for surgery resident training. Method(s): Nineteen PGY2s and 22 PGY4s were enrolled. Residents completed a pretest and posttest consisting of five VR and three previously validated inanimate tasks. Training included practicing 33 VR tasks until a total score >= 90% (""mastery"") was achieved using automated metrics (time, economy of motion). Inanimate performance was evaluated by two trained, blinded raters using video review metrics (time, errors, and modified OSATS). Outcomes were defined as: curriculum feasibility (completion rate, training time, repetitions), training effectiveness (pre/post training skill improvement), and skill transferability (skill transfer to validated inanimate drills). Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney U tests were used; median (IQR) reported. Result(s): Thirty-four of 41 residents (83%) achieved mastery on all 33 VR tasks; median training time was 7 h (IQR: 5'26-8'52). Pretest vs. post-test performance improved (all p < 0.001) according to all VR and Inanimate metrics for both PGY2 and PGY4 residents. Significant pretest performance differences were observed between PGY2 and PGY4 residents for VR but not inanimate tasks; no PGY2 vs. PGY4 posttest performance differences were observed for both VR and inanimate tasks. Conclusion(s): This mastery-based VR curriculum was associated with a high completion rate and excellent feasibility. Significant performance improvements were noted for both the VR and inanimate tasks, supporting training effectiveness and skill transferability.

Efficacy of standardized training on a virtual reality simulator to advance knee and shoulder arthroscopic motor skills,"Rahm, S.; Wieser, K.; Bauer, D. E.; Waibel, F. W.; Meyer, D. C.; Gerber, C.; Fucentese, S. F.","Background: Most studies demonstrated, that training on a virtual reality based arthroscopy simulator leads to an improvement of technical skills in orthopaedic surgery. However, how long and what kind of training is optimal for young residents is unknown. In this study we tested the efficacy of a standardized, competency based training protocol on a validated virtual reality based knee- and shoulder arthroscopy simulator. Method(s): Twenty residents and five experts in arthroscopy were included. All participants performed a test including knee -and shoulder arthroscopy tasks on a virtual reality knee- and shoulder arthroscopy simulator. The residents had to complete a competency based training program. Thereafter, the previously completed test was retaken. We evaluated the metric data of the simulator using a z-score and the Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET) to assess training effects in residents and performance levels in experts. Result(s): The residents significantly improved from pre- to post training in the overall z-score: - 9.82 (range, - 20.35 to - 1.64) to - 2.61 (range, - 6.25 to 1.5); p < 0.001. The overall ASSET score improved from 55 (27 to 84) percent to 75 (48 to 92) percent; p < 0.001. The experts, however, achieved a significantly higher z-score in the shoulder tasks (p < 0.001 and a statistically insignificantly higher z-score in the knee tasks with a p = 0.921. The experts mean overall ASSET score (knee and shoulder) was significantly higher in the therapeutic tasks (p < 0.001) compared to the residents post training result. Conclusion(s): The use of a competency based simulator training with this specific device for 3-5 h is an effective tool to advance basic arthroscopic skills of resident in training from 0 to 5 years based on simulator measures and simulator based ASSET testing. Therefore, we conclude that this sort of training method appears useful to learn the handling of the camera, basic anatomy and the triangulation with instruments.

Benchmark scores for all general performance metrics generated by the simulator were calculated. Assessment exercises were selected by expert consensus and through learning-curve analysis. Three basic skill and two advanced skill exercises were identified. Result(s): Benchmark scores based on expert performance offered viable targets for novice and intermediate trainees in robotic surgery. Novice participants met the competency standards for most basic skill exercises; however, advanced exercises were significantly more challenging. Intermediate participants performed better across the seven metrics but still did not achieve the benchmark standard in the more difficult exercises. Conclusion(s): Benchmark scores derived from expert performances offer relevant and challenging scores for trainees to achieve during VR simulation training. Objective feedback allows both participants and trainers to monitor educational progress and ensures that training remains effective. Furthermore, the well-defined goals set through benchmarking offer clear targets for trainees and enable training to move to a more efficient competency based curriculum.

Virtually Competent: A Comparative Analysis of Virtual Reality and Dry-Lab Robotic Simulation Training,"Raison, N.; Gavazzi, A.; Abe, T.; Ahmed, K.; Dasgupta, P.","Background: Virtual reality (VR) and dry-lab simulation have been widely validated for robotic surgical training. Both modalities are used during the early stages of the learning curve, yet, no comparative analysis of the two modalities has been undertaken. This study compares the effectiveness of VR and dry-lab simulation for basic robotic surgical skill training. Method(s): A comparative study of 43 robotic novices was undertaken at two centers in the United Kingdom and Italy. Participants were allocated to either VR or dry-lab simulation and completed a robotic simulation training program. On completion, all participants were assessed by performing a urethrovesical anastomosis on a synthetic model. Technical proficiency was measured by two trained raters using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) tool. All participants completed a qualitative posttraining assessment questionnaire. Result(s): Baseline characteristics were equal between the two groups. Both VR and dry-lab training led to a significant improvement in technical proficiency. Overall mean GEARS scores increased by 5.6 and 2.5 following dry-lab and VR simulation training, respectively (p = 0.034). Dry-lab training showed significantly greater improvements than VR simulation, but only after the third training session. Both techniques were highly rated by participants. Conclusion(s): Both VR and dry-lab simulation were effective in improving robotic surgical skill but were not equal. For more advanced skill training, dry-lab training was found to be superior to VR simulation. Dry-lab training offers specific benefits to robotic surgical training and should remain a principal component of the simulation curriculum. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2020,March,Journal of Endourology,34(3),,379-384,631335190,,,#4176,Raison 2020,,
Procedural virtual reality simulation training for robotic surgery: a randomised controlled trial,"Raison, N.; Harrison, P.; Abe, T.; Aydin, A.; Ahmed, K.; Dasgupta, P.","Background: Virtual reality (VR) training is widely used for surgical training, supported by comprehensive, high-quality validation. Technological advances have enabled the development of procedural-based VR training. This study assesses the effectiveness of procedural VR compared to basic skills VR in minimally invasive surgery. Method(s): 26 novice participants were randomised to either procedural VR (n = 13) or basic VR simulation (n = 13). Both cohorts completed a structured training programme. Simulator metric data were used to plot learning curves. All participants then performed parts of a robotic radical prostatectomy (RARP) on a fresh frozen cadaver. Performances were compared against a cohort of 9 control participants without any training experience. Performances were video recorded and assessed blindly using GEARS post hoc. Result(s): Learning curve analysis demonstrated improvements in technical skill for both training modalities although procedural training was associated with greater training effects. Any VR training resulted in significantly higher GEARS scores than no training (GEARS score 11.3 +/- 0.58 vs. 8.8 +/- 2.9, p = 0.002). Procedural VR training was found to be more effective than both basic VR training and no training (GEARS 11.9 +/- 2.9 vs. 10.7 +/- 2.8 vs. 8.8 +/- 1.4, respectively, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): This trial has shown that a structured programme of procedural VR simulation is effective for robotic training with technical skills successfully transferred to a clinical task in cadavers. Further work to evaluate the role of procedural-based VR for more advanced surgical skills training is required.

A virtual reality simulation model of spinal ultrasound: Role in teaching spinal sonoanatomy,"Ramlogan, R.; Niazi, A. U.; Jin, R.; Johnson, J.; Chan, V. W.; Perlas, A.","Background and Objectives: Ultrasound assessment of the lumbar spine improves the success of spinal and epidural anesthesia, especially for patients with underlying difficult anatomy. To assist with the teaching and learning of ultrasound-guided neuraxial anesthesia, we have created an online interactive educational model (http://www.usra.ca/vspine.php and http://pie.med.utoronto.ca/vspine). The aim of the current study was to determine whether the virtual spine model improved the knowledge of neuraxial anatomy and sonoanatomy. Method(s): After obtaining ethics board approval and written participant consent, 14 anesthesia trainees with no prior experience with spine ultrasound imaging were included in this study. Construct validity was assessed using a pretest/posttest design to measure the knowledge acquired from self-study of the virtual spine simulationmodules. Two tests (A and B) with 20 multiple-choice questions were used either for the pretest or posttest, at random in order to account for possible differences in difficulty between the 2 tests. These tests were administered immediately before and after a 1-hour training session using the spine ultrasound model. Result(s): Fourteen anesthesia trainees completed the study. Seven used test A as the pretest (group A), and 7 used test B as the pretest (group B). Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05) in test scores after a 1-hour session with the spine ultrasound model. The mean scores were 55% (SD, 11.2%) on the pretest and 77% (SD, 8.7%) on the posttest. Conclusion(s): The study demonstrated that after 1 hour of self-study by the trainees on the spine ultrasound model test scores improved by 40%.

A Virtual Reality Curriculum for Pediatric Residents Decreases Rates of Influenza Vaccine Refusal,"Real, F. J.; DeBlasio, D.; Beck, A. F.; Ollberding, N. J.; Davis, D.; Cruse, B.; Samaan, Z.; McLinden, D.; Klein, M. D.","Objective Influenza vaccine hesitancy is common in the primary care setting. Though physicians can affect caregivers' attitudes toward vaccination, physicians report uneasiness discussing vaccine hesitancy. Few studies have targeted physician-patient communication training as a means to decrease vaccination refusal. Methods An immersive virtual reality (VR) curriculum was created to teach pediatric residents communication skills when discussing influenza vaccine hesitancy. This pilot curriculum consisted of 3 VR simulations during which residents counseled graphical character representatives (avatars) who expressed vaccine hesitancy. Participants were randomized to the intervention (n = 24) or control (n = 21) group. Only residents in the intervention group underwent the VR curriculum. Impact of the curriculum was assessed through difference in influenza vaccine refusal rates between the intervention and control groups in the 3 months after the VR curriculum. Results Participants included postgraduate level (PL) 2 and PL3 pediatric residents. All eligible residents (n = 45) participated; the survey response rate was 100%. In patients aged 6 to 59 months, residents in the intervention group had a decreased rate of influenza vaccination refusal in the postcurriculum period compared to the control group (27.8% vs 37.1%; P = .03). Conclusions Immersive VR may be an effective modality to teach communication skills to medical trainees. Next steps include evaluation of the curriculum in a larger, multisite trial.

Resident perspectives on communication training that utilizes immersive virtual reality,"Real, F. J.; DeBlasio, D.; Ollberding, N. J.; Davis, D.; Cruse, B.; McLinden, D.; Klein, M. D.","Background: Communication skills can be difficult to teach and assess in busy outpatient settings. These skills are important for effective counseling such as in cases of influenza vaccine hesitancy. It is critical to consider novel educational methods to supplement current strategies aimed at teaching relational skills. Methods: An immersive virtual reality (VR) curriculum on addressing influenza vaccine hesitancy was developed using Kern's six-step approach to curriculum design. The curriculum was meant to teach best-practice communication skills in cases of influenza vaccine hesitancy. Eligible participants included postgraduate level (PL) 2 and PL-3 pediatric residents (n = 24). Immediately following the curriculum, a survey was administered to assess residents' attitudes toward the VR curriculum and perceptions regarding the effectiveness of VR in comparison to other educational modalities. A survey was administered 1 month following the VR curriculum to assess trainee-perceived impact of the curriculum on clinical practice. Results: All eligible residents (n = 24) completed the curriculum. Ninety-two percent (n = 22) agreed or strongly agreed that VR simulations were like real-life patient encounters. Seventy-five percent (n = 18) felt that VR was equally effective to standardized patient (SP) encounters and less effective than bedside teaching (P < 0.001). At 1-month follow-up, 67% of residents (n = 16) agreed or strongly agreed that the VR experience improved how they counseled families in cases of influenza vaccine hesitancy. Discussion: An immersive VR curriculum at our institution was well-received by learners, and residents rated VR as equally effective as SP encounters.

Impact of a Virtual Reality Curriculum on Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: A Pilot Trial,"Real, F. J.; Ollberding, N. J.; Meisman, A. R.; DeBlasio, D. J.; Pero, M. B.; Davis, D.; Cruse, B.; Klein, M. D.; Kahn, J. A.; Rosen, B. L.","Although the strongest predictor of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a high-quality recommendation, physicians often provide weak recommendations. Thus, the authors developed Virtual Immersive Communication Training on Recommending Immunizations (VICTORI), a virtual reality (VR)-based intervention that provided physicians the opportunity to deliberately practice recommendation behaviors. VICTORI included VR simulations during which participants counseled caregiver avatars hesitant to vaccinate. Before participation in VICTORI, participants reviewed a smartphone application on recommendation behaviors. A nonrandomized control trial of VICTORI was conducted with licensed and resident physicians. The intervention group completed the application and VICTORI simulations, whereas a comparison group completed only the application. The hypothesis was that HPV vaccination rates would increase for patients in the intervention group. The preintervention period was defined as the 6 months before allocated training (February 1, 2020-July 31, 2020), and the postintervention period was the 6 months after (October 1, 2020-March 31, 2021). The primary outcome was a change in the rates of human papillomavirus vaccine initiation among eligible patients presenting to clinic before and after. Of 142 eligible physicians, 134 (94%) chose to participate, with 93 of /97 (96%) intervention and 30 of 37 (81%) comparison participants completing study protocols. There was a statistically significant increase in patients' HPV vaccine initiation rates after training within the intervention group (54.3%-72.4%; 18.1% difference [95% CI=11.0, 25.8]; p<0.001) but not within the comparison group (59.5%-63.4%; 3.9% difference [95% CI= -11.0, 19.0]; p=0.609). In conclusion, HPV vaccine initiation increased after VR training, and further study is warranted.

Virtual reality: an effective tool for teaching root canal anatomy to undergraduate dental students - a preliminary study,"Reymus, M.; Liebermann, A.; Diegritz, C.","AIM: To introduce virtual reality (VR) into the endodontic curriculum for teaching root canal anatomy and to evaluate the effectiveness of this new method on third-year undergraduate students. METHODOLOGY: Extracted human teeth were digitized using a CBCT scan and converted into STL files. The corresponding files were either 3D printed or imported into a VR software program. Subsequently, forty-two third-year undergraduate dental students in preclinical training were asked to respond to a questionnaire analysing their ability to detect all the anatomic features of the replica teeth and their comprehension of the underlying root canal anatomy. The investigation was based on three different methods: two-dimensional radiography, CBCT scanning and VR simulation. Data were analysed using McNemar's and binomial test, and the level of significance was set to 0.05 (P = 0.05). RESULT(S): Students reported that CBCT and VR allowed them to detect all anatomic features more than radiography (P < 0.001 - P = 0.049). Because it allowed improved comprehension of root canal anatomy, the VR simulation was considered better than CBCT scanning and radiography. Most of the students adapted well to the VR simulation. CONCLUSION(S): Dental students greatly appreciated the integration of VR simulation into the endodontic curriculum. From a didactic point of view, VR has considerable advantages over three-dimensional reconstructions and two-dimensional radiographs when teaching root canal anatomy. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Resuscitation is more likely to succeed if it is performed properly and at the right time. In this scenario, simulation is an appropriate tool for training and evaluating the abilities of all staff working in the delivery room, as well as students. As simulations require a high degree of immersivity in order to be effective, the use of technologies like Virtual (VR) and mixed reality (MR) have garnered more interest in training. Currently, some VR and MR applications have been developed for adult life support training, but neonatal tools are still missing. To overcome this limitation, we present RiNeo MR, a prototype of a MR simulator for neonatal resuscitation training. The simulator consists of (i) a sensorized physical model of the newborn that allows monitoring chest compressions; (ii) a VR head mounted display that allows visualizing a virtual 3D model of the manikin and scenarios of the delivery and operating rooms. This enables students, and healthcare providers to be immersed in realistic hospital settings while performing life support procedures on the newborn manikin.

Virtual coach: the next tool in functional endoscopic sinus surgery education,"Richards, J. P.; Done, A. J.; Barber, S. R.; Jain, S.; Son, Y. J.; Chang, E. H.","Backgound: Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) can be challenging as novices become accustomed to handling endoscopes and instruments while navigating complex sinonasal anatomy. Experts demonstrate fluid and efficient motions when addressing pathology. The training process from novice to expert relies on hands-on experience in cadaveric laboratories and preceptorship models that require significant time and expense. This study aims to validate the use of a virtual coach to guide users step-by-step through a basic FESS. Method(s): Seventeen surgeons were grouped into novice (n = 10) and expert (n = 7) based on self-reported levels of surgical experience. Users were trained using the maxillary antrostomy module in the Neurorhinological Surgery (NRS) simulator combining the physical craniofacial model with virtual reality (VR)-tracked surgical instruments in the VR operating room. The virtual coach guided the user using surgical videos, auditory, and visual cues. The coach recorded data for each subject including the number of times borders of the nasal cavity were encountered and time to completion. Users graded the usefulness of the virtual coach on a Likert questionnaire. Result(s): Face validity of our NRS simulator was replicated by user questionnaires, and construct validity replicated by differentiation between novice and expert level surgeons (p < 0.01). Novices contacted a significantly higher number of anatomic borders (n = 17) and had a longer operative time (t = 370 seconds). All users reported high scores on the benefit and usefulness of the virtual coach. Conclusion(s): The virtual coach provides a useful tool to enhance FESS education by providing objective real-time data in a novel mixed-reality surgical environment.

Effective instructional design template for virtual simulations in nursing education,"Rim, D.; Shin, H.","BACKGROUND: Virtual-reality simulation (VRS) is an innovative teaching method in nursing education. However, information regarding the educational elements that should be included in the associated instructional design, and the technology necessary for its optimal implementation, is limited. OBJECTIVE(S): To develop an effective template for VRS-based nursing education, and to evaluate its usability. DESIGN: A methodological study. SETTING: Multimedia room in university. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen undergraduate nursing students. METHOD(S): First, we developed a template, which was validated by content experts. The template was then modified based on the experts' feedback, and was then applied in three VRS scenarios. RESULT(S): The developed template consisted of educational elements, virtual elements, and scenario outlines. The educational elements were learning target, learning objectives, instructional design, course flow, feedback strategies, follow-up and evaluation, debriefing structures, and human resources. The virtual elements were virtual framework, degree of virtuality, and virtual resources. The scenario outline included scenario target, learning objectives, evaluation, course flow, associated knowledge and skill, setting, scenario background, protocols, nursing intervention, algorithm and storyboard, documentation forms, mechanical supports, scenario characters, accessory items, and debriefing components. Three VRS scenarios were developed using this template. Students in focus group interviews described their learning experience. CONCLUSION(S): The template can help educators administer effective VRS-based nursing education; however, the technical level of the platform used should be considered. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulation in urological training: Where are we in 2017?,"Robinson, A. J.; Miller, G.; Rukin, N.","Traditional Halstedian principles are no longer compatible with modern day urological training. Changing patterns of healthcare provision and the advanced nature of minimally invasive urological surgery have resulted in trainees receiving reduced exposure to independent operative experience. The drive towards consultant-delivered care, coupled with the introduction of the European working time directive, necessitate the urology trainee to meet end-of-training competencies with fewer learning opportunities compared with previous generations. Simulation provides an opportunity to compensate for reduced operative experience by augmenting both technical and non-technical skills development. A variety of simulation models can be used from cadaveric, synthetic and animal models to advanced virtual reality to aid surgical training. Whilst simulation is not without limitations, it has the potential to significantly enhance procedural competency and non-technical skills in a risk-free environment. Clear benefits, including equipment familiarity and trainee confidence have been demonstrated. However, direct transferability of these benefits to an operating-theatre is not clearly evident. Whilst not a substitute for clinical practice, simulation is likely to prove itself as a valuable adjunct to urological training. In this narrative review, we examine the current literature on simulation training in relation to urological surgery.

However, these present present limitations. Virtual Reality (VR) and haptic simulators have been proposed with promising results and advantages and have showed usefullness in the preclinical training environment. We designed DENTIFY, a multimodal immersive simulator to assist Operative Dentistry learning, which exposes the user to different virtual clinical scenarios while operating a haptic pen to simulate dental drilling. Objective(s): The main objective is to assess DENTIFY's usability, acceptance, and educational usefulness to dentists, in order to make the proper changes and, subsequently, to test DENTIFY with undergraduate preclinical dental students. Method(s): DENTIFY combines an immersive head mounted VR display, a haptic pen in which the pen itself has been replaced by a 3D printed model of a dental turbine and a controller with buttons to adjust and select the scenario of the simulation, along with 3D sounds of real dental drilling. The user's dominant hand operated the virtual turbine on the VR-created scenario, while the non-dominant hand is used to activate the simulator and case selection. The simulation sessions occurred in a controlled virtual environment. We evaluated DENTIFY's usability and acceptance over the course of 13 training sessions with dental professionals, after the users performed a drilling task in virtual dental tissues. Result(s): The conducted user acceptance indicates that DENTIFY shows potencial enhancing learning in operative dentistry as it promotes self-evaluation and multimodal immersion on the dental drilling experience. Conclusion(s): DENTIFY presented significant usability and acceptance from trained dentists. This tool showed to have teaching and learning (hence, pedagogical) potential in operative dentistry.

This study aimed to evaluate VR simulation as a tool to improve the understanding of temporal bone anatomy during Ear, Nose, and Throat residency. The primary goal was to determine whether VR simulation improved written examination performance on temporal bone radiology. Notably, 15 residents were recruited and trained by the VOXEL-MAN Tempo surgical simulator system (UKE-Voxel-man Group, Hamburg, Germany, 2009). The secondary outcome was to determine whether VR simulation improved the surgical skills of the trained residents during cadaveric dissection of temporal bone.

So far, the 3D sources for VR simulation have been derived from medical images, which lack real color. The authors made photographic 3D models from dissected cadavers and integrated them into the VR platform. This study aimed to introduce a method of developing a photograph-integrated VR and to evaluate the educational effect of these models. METHOD(S): A silicone-injected cadaver head was prepared. A CT scan of the specimen was taken, and the soft tissue and skull were segmented to 3D objects. The cadaver was dissected layer by layer, and each layer was 3D scanned by a photogrammetric method. The objects were imported to a free VR application and layered. Using the head-mounted display and controllers, the various neurosurgical approaches were demonstrated to neurosurgical residents. After performing hands-on virtual surgery with photographic 3D models, a feedback survey was collected from 31 participants. RESULT(S): Photographic 3D models were seamlessly integrated into the VR platform. Various skull base approaches were successfully performed with photograph-integrated VR. During virtual dissection, the landmark anatomical structures were identified based on their color and shape. Respondents rated a higher score for photographic 3D models than for conventional 3D models (4.3 +/- 0.8 vs 3.2 +/- 1.1, respectively; p = 0.001). They responded that performing virtual surgery with photographic 3D models would help to improve their surgical skills and to develop and study new surgical approaches.

The dependent variables were placement error, number of focus shifts, and completion time. Furthermore, workspace efficiency was quantified as the number and duration of potential surgeon-tablet collisions avoided by the ARHMD. Result(s):The ARHMD condition yielded smaller placement errors (Task1: 45%, P < 0.001; Task2: 14%, P = 0.01), fewer focus shifts (Task1: 93%, P < 0.001; Task2: 88%, P = 0.0039), and longer completion times (Task1: 31%, P < 0.001; Task2: 24%, P = 0.013). Furthermore, the ARHMD avoided potential tablet collisions (4.8 for 3.2 seconds in Task1; 3.8 for 1.3 seconds in Task2). Conclusion(s):The ARHMD system promises to improve accuracy and to eliminate focus shifts in surgical telementoring. Because ARHMD participants were able to refine their execution of instructions, task completion time increased. Unlike a tablet system, the ARHMD does not require modifying natural motions to avoid collisions. Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Evaluation of an augmented reality platform for austere surgical telementoring: a randomized controlled crossover study in cricothyroidotomies,"Rojas-Munoz, E.; Lin, C.; Sanchez-Tamayo, N.; Cabrera, M. E.; Andersen, D.; Popescu, V.; Barragan, J. A.; Zarzaur, B.; Murphy, P.; Anderson, K.; Douglas, T.; Griffis, C.; McKee, J.; Kirkpatrick, A. W.; Wachs, J. P.","Telementoring platforms can help transfer surgical expertise remotely. However, most telementoring platforms are not designed to assist in austere, pre-hospital settings. This paper evaluates the system for telementoring with augmented reality (STAR), a portable and self-contained telementoring platform based on an augmented reality head-mounted display (ARHMD). The system is designed to assist in austere scenarios: a stabilized first-person view of the operating field is sent to a remote expert, who creates surgical instructions that a local first responder wearing the ARHMD can visualize as three-dimensional models projected onto the patient's body. Our hypothesis evaluated whether remote guidance with STAR could lead to performing a surgical procedure better, as opposed to remote audio-only guidance. Remote expert surgeons guided first responders through training cricothyroidotomies in a simulated austere scenario, and on-site surgeons evaluated the participants using standardized evaluation tools. The evaluation comprehended completion time and technique performance of specific cricothyroidotomy steps. The analyses were also performed considering the participants' years of experience as first responders, and their experience performing cricothyroidotomies. A linear mixed model analysis showed that using STAR was associated with higher procedural and non-procedural scores, and overall better performance. Additionally, a binary logistic regression analysis showed that using STAR was associated to safer and more successful executions of cricothyroidotomies. This work demonstrates that remote mentors can use STAR to provide first responders with guidance and surgical knowledge, and represents a first step towards the adoption of ARHMDs to convey clinical expertise remotely in austere scenarios.

HipSim - hip fracture surgery simulation utilizing the Learning Curve-Cumulative Summation test (LC-CUSUM),"Rolfing, J. D.; Jensen, R. D.; Paltved, C.","Background and purpose - Virtual reality simulation of hip fracture surgery is available for orthopedic residents nationwide in Denmark. Summative assessment of learning applying the learning curve cumulative summation test (LC-CUSUM) has not been utilized in orthopedic simulation training. The strength of the LC-CUSUM is that it assumes incompetency and signals competency based on solid statistics. We investigated the LC-CUSUM characteristics of novices stepwise mastering the simulated dynamic hip screw (DHS) procedure. Material and methods - 32 1st-year orthopedic residents participated in HipSim and its 3 subsequent LC-CUSUM evaluations: placing a Kirschner wire, placing a Kirschner wire in different patients, and performing the entire DHS procedure in different patients. The career status of the participants, i.e., still working in orthopedics or in another specialty was recorded >= 2 years after participation and associated with the simulation performance (passed/failed). Results - 13/14 participants passing HipSim according to LC-CUSUM were still working in orthopedics, while 9/18 participants failing HipSim had quit orthopedics at >= 2 years follow-up. The simulator-generated feedback did not statistically significantly differ between the groups. Interpretation - LC-CUSUM and its summative pass/fail assessment of each simulation was feasible in this formative simulation program. Clinical educators can be reassured that participants passing HipSim are likely to continue to 2nd-5th year of residency, while failing HipSim should raise concerns and trigger career counselling and clinical supervision. The motivational aspect of LC-CUSUM pass/fail assessment when designing formative simulation training warrants further research. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Augmented Reality Microsurgery: A Tool for Training Micromanipulations in Ophthalmic Surgery Using Augmented Reality,"Ropelato, S.; Menozzi, M.; Michel, D.; Siegrist, M.","INTRODUCTION: Current methods of training microsurgical interventions have various limitations, including limited transferability to the human model, economic demands, and ethical concerns. In this article, we show how surgery simulations can overcome these issues and how, combined with the application of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), they can be used to train tasks in ophthalmic surgery more efficiently. METHOD(S): We investigated physician trainee efficiency of learning microsurgical skills using our purpose-built microsurgery simulator that tracks a micromanipulator and displays a three-dimensional representation of the interior of a human eye in an augmented reality (AR) headset. The expertise of ophthalmic surgeons helped define five subtasks corresponding to the steps of internal limiting membrane peeling. Using our AR surgery simulation, 50 participants underwent two training sessions, one using the ITS that dynamically adapts the task sequence to the participant's progress and one using a fixed task sequence. RESULT(S): We found significant improvement in micromanipulation performance in the first training session with both the ITS and classic training. In the second session, however, only the participants training with the ITS had further improvements in performance. CONCLUSION(S): Results of this study demonstrate the usability of AR simulation in training micromanipulation skills and support the claim that simulators can be used in ophthalmic surgery training. This study also extends the existing literature by demonstrating an application of ITS for surgical training. The potential of this method is further analyzed in ongoing studies and discussions with experts in ophthalmic surgery.",2020,1-Apr,Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,15(2),,122-127,630892885,,,#4318,Ropelato 2020,,
Applying an immersive tutorial in virtual reality to learning a new technique,"Ros, M.; Debien, B.; Cyteval, C.; Molinari, N.; Gatto, F.; Lonjon, N.","Objective: The medical world is continuously evolving, with techniques being created or improved almost daily. Immersive virtual reality (VR) is a technology that could be harnessed to develop tools that meet the educational challenges of this changing environment. We previously described the immersive tutorial, a 3D video (filmed from the first-person point of view), displayed on a VR application. This tool offers access to supplementary educational data in addition to the video. Here we attempt to assess improvement in learning a technique using this new educational format. Material(s) and Method(s): We selected a single neurosurgical technique for the study: external ventricular drainage. We wrote a technical note describing this procedure and produced the corresponding immersive tutorial. We conducted a prospective randomized comparative study with students. All participants read the technical note, and one group used the immersive tutorial as a teaching supplement. The students completed a multiple-choice questionnaire immediately after the training and again at six months. Result(s): One hundred seventy-six fourth-year medical students participated in the study; 173 were included in assessing the immediate learning outcomes and 72 were included at the six-month follow-up. The VR group demonstrated significantly better short-term results than the control group (P = 0.01). The same trend was seen at six months. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this study presents one of the largest cohorts for VR. The use of the immersive tutorial could enable a large number of healthcare professionals to be trained without the need for expensive equipment.

From stereoscopic recording to virtual reality headsets: Designing a new way to learn surgery,"Ros, M.; Trives, J. V.; Lonjon, N.","Objective To improve surgical practice, there are several different approaches to simulation. Due to wearable technologies, recording 3D movies is now easy. The development of a virtual reality headset allows imagining a different way of watching these videos: using dedicated software to increase interactivity in a 3D immersive experience. The objective was to record 3D movies via a main surgeon's perspective, to watch files using virtual reality headsets and to validate pedagogic interest. Material and methods Surgical procedures were recorded using a system combining two side-by-side cameras placed on a helmet. We added two LEDs just below the cameras to enhance luminosity. Two files were obtained in mp4 format and edited using dedicated software to create 3D movies. Files obtained were then played using a virtual reality headset. Surgeons who tried the immersive experience completed a questionnaire to evaluate the interest of this procedure for surgical learning. Results Twenty surgical procedures were recorded. The movies capture a scene which is extended 180degree horizontally and 90degree vertically. The immersive experience created by the device conveys a genuine feeling of being in the operating room and seeing the procedure first-hand through the eyes of the main surgeon. All surgeons indicated that they believe in pedagogical interest of this method. Conclusions We succeeded in recording the main surgeon's point of view in 3D and watch it on a virtual reality headset. This new approach enhances the understanding of surgery; most of the surgeons appreciated its pedagogic value. This method could be an effective learning tool in the future.

Development of augmented-reality applications in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery,"Rose, A. S.; Kim, H.; Fuchs, H.; Frahm, J. M.","Objectives/Hypothesis: Augmented reality (AR) allows for the addition of transparent virtual images and video to one's view of a physical environment. Our objective was to develop a head-worn, AR system for accurate, intraoperative localization of pathology and normal anatomic landmarks during open head and neck surgery. Study Design: Face validity and case study. Method(s): A protocol was developed for the creation of three-dimensional (3D) virtual models based on computed tomography scans. Using the HoloLens AR platform, a novel system of registration and tracking was developed. Accuracy was determined in relation to actual physical landmarks. A face validity study was then performed in which otolaryngologists were asked to evaluate the technology and perform a simulated surgical task using AR image guidance. A case study highlighting the potential usefulness of the technology is also presented. Result(s): An AR system was developed for intraoperative 3D visualization and localization. The average error in measurement of accuracy was 2.47 +/- 0.46 millimeters (1.99, 3.30). The face validity study supports the potential of this system to improve safety and efficiency in open head and neck surgical procedures. Conclusion(s): An AR system for accurate localization of pathology and normal anatomic landmarks of the head and neck is feasible with current technology. A face validity study reveals the potential value of the system in intraoperative image guidance. This application of AR, among others in the field of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, promises to improve surgical efficiency and patient safety in the operating room.

Lessons Learned: Raising Awareness of Civility and Incivility Using Semi-Virtual Reality Simulation,"Rose, K. A.; Jenkins, S. D.; Astroth, K.; Woith, W.; Jarvill, M.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of our web-based, semi-virtual reality simulation was to raise baccalaureate nursing students' awareness of civility and incivility. Educators know civility in nursing is crucial to safe and effective patient care. However, nursing students have reported physiological and psychological distress after experiencing incivility. If nurse educators are unable to better promote civility, the quality of nursing education, and ultimately nursing practice, is threatened. METHOD(S): We implemented an innovative civility-related, semi-virtual reality, simulation with senior-level nursing students. After attending a faculty-led discussion on the importance of civility and incivility, students participated in a web-based, semi-virtual reality simulation, followed by a synchronous debriefing session. RESULT(S): Students reported that the intervention raised their awareness of civility and incivility. CONCLUSION(S): This article describes the intervention and shares the lessons learned in implementing it so nurse educators may replicate this innovative strategy to raise awareness of civility in nursing education.

"Clinical Ultrasound Education for Medical Students: Virtual Reality Versus e-Learning, a Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial","Rosenfeldt Nielsen, M.; Kristensen, E. Q.; Jensen, R. O.; Mollerup, A. M.; Pfeiffer, T.; Graumann, O.","The primary aim was to evaluate the effect of immersive virtual reality learning for training medical students in basic clinical ultrasound. Secondary outcomes were to explore if virtual reality learning had an effect on hand-eye coordination skills and if the medical students wanted more virtual reality learning. This pilot study was a double-blind, parallel-group, block-randomized, controlled trial. Participants (n = 20) were blinded and randomized to virtual reality or e-learning for basic ultrasound education. Medical students with no previous ultrasound education were recruited voluntarily from the University of Southern Denmark. Data were collected during introductory courses on ultrasound from March to May 2019. Participants were assessed with Objective Structured Assessment on Ultrasound Skills. Assessing supervisors were blinded. The virtual reality group (n = 11) scored a significantly higher Objective Structured Assessment on Ultrasound Skills score (143 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 135 to 151]) compared with the e-learning group (n = 9; 126 [95% CI, 113 to 138]; mean difference, 17 points [95% CI, 4 to 30]; P < 0.01). No significant effect on the hand-eye score was found (mean difference, 3 points [95 % CI, -3 to 9]; P = 0.32). Ninety-one percent of the virtual reality group wanted more virtual reality learning. Immersive virtual reality learning improved medical students' ultrasound skills significantly compared with e-learning. The hand-eye score was higher in the virtual reality group, although not at a significant level. Students wanted more virtual reality learning.

Effect of virtual reality simulation training on real-life cataract surgery complications: systematic literature review,"Rothschild, P.; Richardson, A.; Beltz, J.; Chakrabarti, R.","Virtual reality simulation has become progressively popular as a training tool in ophthalmology. However, debate continues as to whether VRS has resulted in better outcomes for patients after cataract surgery. Accordingly, a qualitative systematic literature review was conducted to identify whether VRS training results in a reduced complication rate after real-life cataract surgery. Included studies measured the effect of VRS on real-life patient outcomes after cataract surgery. Databases searched included MEDLINE (Ovid), The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and CINAHL. A total of 1917 studies were identified, of which 10 studies were included, spanning from 2011 to 2020. The studies comprised 471 ophthalmological residents, with their complication rates assessed after 30 462 cataract surgery procedures. This systematic literature review indicates that VRS seems to be most helpful in reducing the rate of posterior capsular rupture or errant curvilinear capsulorrhexis and had limited evidence in reducing the rate of other complications.

Incorporating virtual reality in nurse education: A qualitative study of nursing students' perspectives,"Saab, M. M.; Hegarty, J.; Murphy, D.; Landers, M.","BACKGROUND: Recent challenges to nurse education have resulted in an increased use of virtual reality which serves as an immersive and effective medium for skill and knowledge acquisition. Virtual reality technology is being included in nurse curricula at undergraduate level. This technology remains a relatively new experience for many nursing students with limited evidence regarding students' perspectives regarding virtual reality. OBJECTIVE(S): To explore nursing students' perspectives of incorporating virtual reality in nurse education. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study using thematic analysis. SETTING: Public university in Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Undergraduate nursing students were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. METHOD(S): Students (n = 26) participated in face-to-face semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups in January and February 2020. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULT(S): Three themes were constructed from the interviews: captivating, innovative, and empowering nature of virtual reality; contextual transfer; and challenges and threats to actualisation. Participants believed that virtual reality affords a novel, fun, memorable, inclusive, and engaging means of learning. Many believed that virtual reality would complement current teaching and learning approaches, help build learners' confidence, and provide nursing students with a safe space for trial, error, and problem-solving. The use of virtual reality was recommended to practise various nursing skills and learn about human anatomy, physiology, problem-solving, and clinical decision-making. Participants identified the resources incurred by the technology as challenges to implementing virtual reality in nurse education and stressed the need for continuous face-to-face feedback. CONCLUSION(S): Findings suggest that virtual reality technology has the potential to facilitate learning, complement current educational approaches, and provide nurse educators with novel and engaging means of content delivery.

Nursing students' views of using virtual reality in healthcare: A qualitative study,"Saab, M. M.; Landers, M.; Murphy, D.; O'Mahony, B.; Cooke, E.; O'Driscoll, M.; Hegarty, J.","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study explored nursing students' views of using virtual reality in healthcare. BACKGROUND: The popularity and use of virtual reality in healthcare delivery and education is on the rise. Yet, the views of future nurses regarding this technology remain underexplored. DESIGN: This is a qualitative descriptive study guided by a naturalistic inquiry and reported using the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist. METHOD(S): Nursing students (n = 26) were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling. They were first exposed to a virtual reality intervention aimed to enhance men's awareness of testicular diseases. This was attempted to familiarise participants with the technology and initiate conversations around its use in healthcare. Participants were then interviewed face-to-face, either individually or within focus groups. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULT(S): Four themes were identified: (i) positive experiences of virtual reality; (ii) challenges to using virtual reality; (iii) settings where virtual reality can be implemented; and (iv) blue-sky and future applications of virtual reality. Participants described this technology as novel, enjoyable, immersive, memorable and inclusive. They questioned, however, the suitability of virtual reality for older adults, reported minor technical difficulties and stressed the importance of prior preparation in the use of the technology. Virtual reality was recommended for use in outpatient healthcare settings, schools and the community. Participants suggested using virtual reality in health promotion, disease prevention and management, and to promote nurses' empathy towards patients. CONCLUSION(S): Findings highlight the potential role of virtual reality in assisting nurses in promoting health and managing disease. Future research is needed to establish the long-term effect of virtual reality interventions among more diverse participants.

A validation study of a virtual-based haptic system for endoscopic sinus surgery training,"Sadeghnejad, S.; Khadivar, F.; Abdollahi, E.; Moradi, H.; Farahmand, F.; Sadr Hosseini, S. M.; Vossoughi, G.","Background: The development of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) training simulators for clinical environment applications has reduced the existing shortcomings in conventional teaching methods, creating a standard environment for trainers and trainees in a more accurate and repeatable fashion. Material(s) and Method(s): In this research, the validation study of an ESS training simulator has been addressed. It is important to consider components that guide trainees to improve their hand movements control in the orbital floor removal in an ESS operation. Therefore, we defined three tasks to perform: pre-experiment learning, training, and evaluation. In these tasks, the critical regions introduced in the virtual training environment are forbidden to be touched. Recruiting 20 participants, divided into two groups, we investigated the performance metrics: quality (the percentage of the realism for the generated force for orbital floor removal and the usefulness of the proposed training system for the surgical educational curricula.), efficiency (time, path length), and safety (touching the goal and forbidden wall). Result(s): All recruited participants answered a post-evaluation questionnaire regarding their perceptions of training system realism, potential educational benefits, and practiced skills. We investigate the differences between groups' performance metrics by utilizing the analysis of variance-Kruskal-Wallis test. Acquired results indicate that training before the actual process of the surgery has a significant effect on the accuracy and validity of the process for surgeons. Conclusion(s): Utilizing a standardized environment, trainers and trainees are able to carry out a process with regular features. In addition to traditional education methods, trainees can learn the risk of surgical operations. The training simulators can, also, provide a standard method for assessing the skills of surgical and medical students.

P.; Cohen, M. S.; Owens, S. T.","PROBLEM: While bedside training has always presented its own unique challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic era has intensified barriers to suitable provider and trainee experiences for both patient care and medical education. APPROACH: This project introduced an innovative solution with the Extended Reality International Grand Rounds, a collaboration between the University of Michigan Center for Medical and Surgical Extended Reality and Imperial College London. Three complex cases were presented to trainees through a wireless, extended reality (XR) headset and augmented by holographic visual aids and expert commentary. This pilot rounding experience was performed through the first-person view of one clinician at the bedside. OUTCOME(S): In 2020, 140 attendees participated in XR International Grand Rounds, and 82 (59%) and 61 (44%) completed pre- and postsurveys, respectively. Survey analysis showed that the majority of respondents (65, 79.3%) had very little to no baseline experience with XR technologies and nearly all (75, 91.5%) agreed that the development and implementation of XR curricula are important in medical training, indicating an unmet need. Nearly all respondents (59, 96.7%) found value in the ability to visualize patients' clinical findings in the XR rounding experience and 60 (98.4%) found value in the ability to visualize patient-specific imaging and test findings in an XR format. Limiting exposure to high-risk patients and care team members with this innovative format was believed to be important to 79 (96.3%) respondents at baseline and that perception was unchanged following the event.

STELA (Smart TV and smartphone-basEd Laparoscopy TrAiner): a no-cost home-based trainer for beginners,"Sandhu, J. S.; Aggarwal, P.","Background: Proficiency in laparoscopy is gradually achieved. After initial simulation, it is safe to move to real patients. Simulation improves the basic attributes of laparoscopy, and its non-availability hampers training. Virtual reality and commercial simulators are exorbitantly expensive. Cheaper non-commercial latest, mobile phone-based simulators appear ergonomically unsuitable. A need for a no-cost, home-based laparoscopic endotrainer was felt by authors. Method(s): The authors proposed the concept of smart TV and smart phone-based laparoscopy trainer (STELA), an almost zero cost, lightweight indigenous, cable-less box-type endotrainer, with a smart phone housed on the model, projecting to smart TV via Wi-fi direct. The simulation timings on STELA were compared with Universal Beetel endotrainer by a group of surgeons and residents using identical tasks like object transfer (OT) and knot making (KM). Result(s): Data were analysed using SPSS, version 23.There was no significant difference in the mean timings of the residents (p > 0.05) on two endotrainers, for both tasks, and of surgeons for OT. Surgeons took significantly longer time (p < 0.05) in KM on STELA. Highest correlation (r = +.848) (<.05) was seen for KM on both devices by residents. Conclusion(s): STELA is a viable, technologically advanced, no cost alternative to the non-commercial cumbersome simulators especially for beginners.

Association of Suturing Technical Skill Assessment Scores between Virtual Reality Simulation and Live Surgery,"Sanford, D.; Ma, R.; Ghoreifi, A.; Haque, T. F.; Nguyen, J.; Hung, A. J.","Introduction Robotic surgical performance, in particular suturing, has been linked to post-operative clinical outcomes. Prior to attempting live surgery, virtual reality (VR) simulators afford opportunities for training surgeons to learn fundamental technical skills. Herein, we evaluate the association of suturing technical skill assessments between VR simulation and live surgery, and functional clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods 20 surgeons completed a VR suturing exercise on the MimicTM Flex VR simulator and the anterior vesicourethral anastomosis during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Three independent and blinded graders provided technical skill scores using a validated assessment tool. Correlations between VR and live scores were assessed by Spearman's correlation coefficients (rho). In addition, 117 historic RARP cases from participating surgeons were extracted, and the association between VR technical skill scores and urinary continence recovery were assessed by a multi-level mixed-effects model. Results A total of 20 (6 training and 14 expert) surgeons participated. Statistically significant correlations for scores provided between VR simulation and live surgery were found for overall and needle driving scores (rho = 0.555, p = 0.011; rho = 0.570, p = 0.009, respectively). A sub-analysis performed on training surgeons found significant correlations for overall scores between VR simulation and live surgery (rho = 0.828, p = 0.042). Expert cases with high VR needle driving scores had significantly greater continence recovery rates at 24 months following RARP (98.5% vs. 84.9%, p = 0.028). Conclusions Our study found significant correlations in technical scores between VR and live surgery, especially amongst training surgeons. Additionally, we found that VR needle driving scores were associated with continence recovery following RARP.

After training, all groups took a post-test and two weeks later the retention test with and without cognitive load and the transfer task on a pig intestine of 150 cm long under cognitive load. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): Mixed ANOVA analysis showed significant differences between the control and VR and VR + CL groups (p = 0.013, p = 0.009) but no differences between the VR + CL and the VR groups (p = 1.0). GOALS bimanual dexterity score on transfer test show that VR + CL group outperformed both Control and VR groups (p = 0.016, p = 0.03). Training under cognitive load benefitted performance on an actual surgical task under similar conditions.

Simulation for Colorectal Surgery,"Sankaranarayanan, G.; Parker, L.; De, S.; Kapadia, M.; Fichera, A.","Introduction: Colorectal surgery is a highly specialized field in surgery that deals with the surgical intervention of disease processes of the colon, rectum, and anus. Gaining proficiency in this field requires training both inside and outside of the operating room. Simulation plays a key role in training surgeons in colorectal surgery. The goal of this study is to review the currently available simulators for training in the field of colorectal surgery. Method(s): A review of the literature was conducted to identify simulators that are both physical such as benchtop, live animal, and cadaver, as wells as virtual reality (VR) simulators. Any reported validity evidence for these simulators were also presented. Result(s): There are several benchtop physical models made of silicone for training in basic colorectal tasks, such as hand-sewn and stapled anastomosis. To improve realism, explanted animal and cadaveric specimens were also used for training. To improve repeatability, objective assessment, both commercial and VR simulators also exist for training in both open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery and emerging areas such as endoscopic submucosal dissection. Conclusion(s): Simulation-based training in colorectal surgery is here to stay and is going to play a significant role in training, credentialing, and quality improvements. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.",2021,May,Journal of Laparoendoscopic and Advanced Surgical Techniques,31(5),,566-569,635060333,,,#4433,Sankaranarayanan 2021,,
Immersive virtual reality-based training improves response in a simulated operating room fire scenario,"Sankaranarayanan, G.; Wooley, L.; Hogg, D.; Dorozhkin, D.; Olasky, J.; Chauhan, S.; Fleshman, J. W.; De, S.; Scott, D.; Jones, D. B.","Background: SAGES FUSE curriculum provides didactic knowledge on OR fire prevention. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of an immersive virtual reality (VR)-based OR fire training simulation system in combination with FUSE didactics. Method(s): The study compared a control with a simulation group. After a pre-test questionnaire that assessed the baseline knowledge, both groups were given didactic material that consists of a 10-min presentation and reading materials about precautions and stopping an OR fire from the FUSE manual. The simulation group practiced on the OR fire simulation for one session that consisted of five trials within a week from the pre-test. One week later, both groups were reassessed using a questionnaire. A week after the post-test both groups also participated in a simulated OR fire scenario while their performance was videotaped for assessment. Result(s): A total of 20 subjects (ten per group) participated in this IRB approved study. Median test scores for the control group increased from 5.5 to 9.00 (p = 0.011) and for the simulation group it increased from 5.0 to 8.5 (p = 0.005). Both groups started at the same baseline (pre-test, p = 0.529) and reached similar level in cognitive knowledge (post-test, p = 0.853). However, when tested in the mock OR fire scenario, 70% of the simulation group subjects were able to perform the correct sequence of steps in extinguishing the simulated fire whereas only 20% subjects in the control group were able to do so (p = 0.003). The simulation group was better than control group in correctly identifying the oxidizer (p = 0.03) and ignition source (p = 0.014). Conclusion(s): Interactive VR-based hands-on training was found to be a relatively inexpensive and effective mode for teaching OR fire prevention and management scenarios.

Virtual reality versus conventional clinical role-play for radiographic positioning training: A students' perception study,"Sapkaroski, D.; Mundy, M.; Dimmock, M. R.","Introduction: Simulated learning environments (SLEs) are commonly utilised by educational institutions. The aim of this study was to assess if students perceptions varied relating to the effectiveness of either a virtual reality (VR) simulation or traditional clinical role-play scenario in developing radiographic hand positioning skills. Method(s): A split-cohort study was performed with Year 1 Undergraduate Radiography students (n = 76). Students were randomly assigned to undertake training for radiographic hand positioning tasks using either the CETSOL VR Clinic software (Group 1) or traditional clinical role-play (Group 2). Following completion of their positioning training, students' perceived impact of the SLE on developing practical and technical skills were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire and free text option. Result(s): Quantitative student perception scores indicated no significant difference between the two simulation modalities, the mean agreement scores (combined strongly agree + agree) for Groups 1 and 2 were 74.8% and 83.8%, respectively, where chi2 (4, n = 66) = 9.5, p-value = 0.394. Key themes expressed by students following a thematic analysis were ""engagement with the learning environment, positioning practice and comparability to clinical practice. Conclusion(s): The perceptions of novice students in training for radiographic hand positioning tasks, using either a VR SLE or clinical role-play scenario, did not differ. There was a strong similarity in common themes, however, a key point of difference identified was the benefit of repetition afforded by the VR simulation, in contrast to the need for more time using traditional role-play in a constrained laboratory setting. Implications for practice: The lack of difference in student perceptions between VR and clinical role-play training, could offer a different approach to clinical training which is easily accessible and allows users to correct mistakes at their own pace.

Immersive virtual reality simulated learning environment versus role-play for empathic clinical communication training,"Sapkaroski, D.; Mundy, M.; Dimmock, M. R.","Introduction: The use of immersive virtual reality simulated learning environments (VR SLEs) for improving clinical communication can offer desirable qualities including repetition and determinism in a safe environment. The aim of this study was to establish whether the mode of delivery, VR SLE versus clinical role-play, could have a measurable effect on clinical empathic communication skills for MRI scenarios. Method(s): A split-cohort study was performed with trainee practitioners (n = 70) and qualified practitioners (n = 9). Participants were randomly assigned to four groups: clinician VR (CVR), clinician role-play (CRP), trainee VR (TVR), and trainee RP (TRP). Clinical communication skills were assessed using two methods: firstly, a self-reported measure - the SE-12 communication questionnaire and, secondly, a training and assessment tool developed by a panel of experts. Result(s): Participants in the VR trainee (TVR) and clinician (CVR) groups reported 11% (P < 0.05) and 7.2% (P < 0.05) improvements in communication confidence post training, whereas trainees assigned to the role-play (TRP) intervention reported a 4.3% (P < 0.05) improvement. Empirical assessment of communication training scores assessing a participant's ability to select empathic statements showed the TVR group performed 5% better on average than their role-play counterparts (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The accuracy of participant's selection of appropriate empathic responses was shown to differ significantly following the training intervention designed to improve interactions with patients that present for an MRI scan. The results may demonstrate the capacity for immersion into an emotional narrative in a VR environment to increase the user's susceptibility for recalling and selecting empathic terminology.

Visualization improves supraclavicular access to the subclavian vein in a mixed reality simulator,"Sappenfield, J. W.; Smith, W. B.; Cooper, L. A.; Lizdas, D.; Gonsalves, D. B.; Gravenstein, N.; Lampotang, S.; Robinson, A. R.","BACKGROUND: We investigated whether visual augmentation (3D, real-time, color visualization) of a procedural simulator improved performance during training in the supraclavicular approach to the subclavian vein, not as widely known or used as its infraclavicular counterpart. METHOD(S): To train anesthesiology residents to access a central vein, a mixed reality simulator with emulated ultrasound imaging was created using an anatomically authentic, 3D-printed, physical mannequin based on a computed tomographic scan of an actual human. The simulator has a corresponding 3D virtual model of the neck and upper chest anatomy. Hand-held instruments such as a needle, an ultrasound probe, and a virtual camera controller are directly manipulated by the trainee and tracked and recorded with submillimeter resolution via miniature, 6 degrees of freedom magnetic sensors. After Institutional Review Board approval, 69 anesthesiology residents and faculty were enrolled and received scripted instructions on how to perform subclavian venous access using the supraclavicular approach based on anatomic landmarks. The volunteers were randomized into 2 cohorts. The first used real-time 3D visualization concurrently with trial 1, but not during trial 2. The second did not use real-time 3D visualization concurrently with trial 1 or 2. However, after trial 2, they observed a 3D visualization playback of trial 2 before performing trial 3 without visualization. An automated scoring system based on time, success, and errors/complications generated objective performance scores. Nonparametric statistical methods were used to compare the scores between subsequent trials, differences between groups (real-time visualization versus no visualization versus delayed visualization), and improvement in scores between trials within groups. RESULT(S): Although the real-time visualization group demonstrated significantly better performance than the delayed visualization group on trial 1 (P = .01), there was no difference in gain scores, between performance on the first trial and performance on the final trial, that were dependent on group (P = .13). In the delayed visualization group, the difference in performance between trial 1 and trial 2 was not significant (P = .09); reviewing performance on trial 2 before trial 3 resulted in improved performance when compared to trial 1 (P < .0001). There was no significant difference in median scores (P = .13) between the real-time visualization and delayed visualization groups for the last trial after both groups had received visualization. Participants reported a significant improvement in confidence in performing supraclavicular access to the subclavian vein. Standard deviations of scores, a measure of performance variability, decreased in the delayed visualization group after viewing the visualization. CONCLUSION(S): Real-time visual augmentation (3D visualization) in the mixed reality simulator improved performance during supraclavicular access to the subclavian vein. No difference was seen in the final trial of the group that received real-time visualization compared to the group that had delayed visualization playback of their prior attempt. Training with the mixed reality simulator improved participant confidence in performing an unfamiliar technique.

Airway management education: An update. It is high time to realize professional airway training as an art,"Saracoglu, K. T.; Saracoglu, A.","Airway training is one of the key element residents need to master during their anesthesiology teaching program. Airway-related disasters during this training might be prevented by the supervision of highly skilled airway experts as teachers. In the present day, a multimodal blended training approach helps in the planning for airway management teaching including both technical and non-technical skills. ""Difficult Airway Response Team"", advanced airway management rotation, case presentations to learn presenting and augmenting about clinical approaches, formalized airway training certificate based on defined competences, hands-on practices, virtual reality airway simulators, high-fidelity full-scale simulators, fresh cadavers, specific ""Train the Airway Trainer Courses"" resulting in certified ""Airway Teachers"", and ultimate delibrate practice on models and patients are cornerstones of teaching and learning airway management. Even though the working hours of the residents in the operating room are reduced due to legislation, it is still possible to provide high quality anesthesiology training to manage the airway by creating the triangle of airway management, quality improvement and patient safety. Ultimately the provision of higher quality airway training needs to be translated into improved patient safety embedded in high end healthcare organizations.

Role of Simulation in Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) Training: A Preliminary Study,"Saratzis, A.; Calderbank, T.; Sidloff, D.; Bown, M. J.; Davies, R. S.","Background Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) requires a high-level of technical-competency to avoid device-related complications. Virtual reality simulation-based training (SBT) may offer an alternative method of psychomotor skill acquisition; however, its role in EVAR training is undefined. This study aimed to: a) benchmark competency levels using EVAR SBT, and b) investigate the impact of supervised SBT on trainee performance. Methods EVAR procedure-related metrics were benchmarked by six experienced consultants using a Simbionix Angiomentor EVAR simulator. Sixteen vascular surgical trainees performing a comparable EVAR before and after structured SBT (>4 teaching sessions) were assessed utilising a modified Likert-scale score. These were benchmarked for comparison against the standard set by the consultant body. Results Median procedural-time for consultants was 43.5 min (IQR 7.5). A significant improvement in trainee procedural-time following SBT was observed (median procedural time 77 min [IQR 20.75] vs. 56 min [IQR: 7.00], p < .0001). The mean (SD) trainee Likert score pre- and post-SBT improved (16.6 [SD 1.455] vs. 28.63 [SD 2.986], p < .0001). Fewer endoleaks were observed (p = .0063) and trainees chose an appropriately sized device more often after SBT. Conclusion This study suggests that EVAR-SBT should be considered as an adjunct to standard psychomotor skill teaching techniques for EVAR within the vascular surgery training curricula.

Using virtual-reality simulation to ensure basic competence in hysteroscopy,"Savran, M. M.; Nielsen, A. B.; Poulsen, B. B.; Thorsen, P. B.; Konge, L.","Background: Hysteroscopy is a technically challenging procedure. Specialty curricula of obstetrics and gynaecology appraise hysteroscopy for trainees but there is no present evidence-based training program that certifies the fundamental technical skills before performance on patients. The objectives of this study were to develop and gather validity evidence for a simulation-based test that can ensure basic competence in hysteroscopy. Method(s): We used the virtual-reality simulator HystMentorTM. Six experts evaluated the feasibility and clinical relevance of the simulator modules. Six modules were selected for the test and a pilot study was carried out. Subsequently, medical students, residents, and experienced gynaecologists were enrolled for testing. Outcomes were based on generated simulator metrics. Validity evidence was explored for all five sources of evidence (content, response process, internal structure, relations to other variables, consequences of testing). Result(s): Inter-case reliability was high for four out of five metrics (Cronbach's alpha >= 0.80). Significant differences were identified when comparing the three groups' performances (p values < 0.05). Participants' clinical experience was significantly correlated to their simulator test score (Pearson's r = 0.49, p < 0.001). A single medical student managed to achieve the established pass/fail score (6.7% false positive) and three experienced gynaecologists failed the test (27.3% false negative). Conclusion(s): We developed a virtual-reality simulation-based test in hysteroscopy with supporting validity evidence. The test is intended to ensure competency in a mastery learning program where trainees practise on the simulator until they are able to pass before they proceed to supervised training on patients.

Success of Surgical Simulation in Orthopedic Training and Applications in Spine Surgery,"Sayari, A. J.; Chen, O.; Harada, G. K.; Lopez, G. D.","Study Design: This was a narrative review. Objective(s): This study aimed to review the current literature on surgical simulation in orthopedics and its application to spine surgery. Summary of Background Data: As orthopedic surgery increases in complexity, training becomes more relevant. There have been mandates in the United States for training orthopedic residents the fundamentals of surgical skills; however, few studies have examined the various training options available. Lack of funding, availability, and time are major constraints to surgical simulation options. Method(s): A PubMed review of the current literature was performed on all relevant articles that examined orthopedic trainees using surgical simulation options. Studies were examined for their thoroughness and application of simulation options to orthopedic surgery. Result(s): Twenty-three studies have explored orthopedic surgical simulation in a setting that objectively assessed trainee performance, most in the field of trauma and arthroscopy. However, there was a lack of consistency in measurements made and skills tested by these simulators. There has only been one study exploring surgical simulation in spine surgery. Conclusion(s): While there has been a growing number of surgical simulators to train orthopedic residents the fundamentals of surgical skills, most of these simulators are not feasible, reproducible, or available to the majority of training centers. Furthermore, the lack of consistency in the objective measurements of these studies makes interpretation of their results difficult. There is a need for more simulation in spine surgery, and future simulators and their respective studies should be reproducible, affordable, applicable to the surgical setting, and easily assembled by various programs across the world.

Protocol for a randomised trial evaluating the effect of applying gamification to simulation-based endoscopy training,"Scaffidi, M. A.; Khan, R.; Walsh, C. M.; Pearl, M.; Winger, K.; Kalaichandran, R.; Lin, P.; Grover, S. C.","Background Simulation-based training (SBT) provides a safe environment and effective means to enhance skills development. Simulation-based curricula have been developed for a number of procedures, including gastrointestinal endoscopy. Gamification, which is the application of game-design principles to non-game contexts, is an instructional strategy with potential to enhance learning. No studies have investigated the effects of a comprehensive gamification curriculum on the acquisition of endoscopic skills among novice endoscopists. Methods and analysis Thirty-six novice endoscopists will be randomised to one of two endoscopy SBT curricula: (1) the Conventional Curriculum Group, in which participants will receive 6 hours of one-on-one simulation training augmented with expert feedback and interlaced with 4 hours of small group teaching on the theory of colonoscopy or (2) the Gamified Curriculum Group, in which participants will receive the same curriculum with integration of the following game-design elements: A leaderboard summarising participants' performance, game narrative, achievement badges and rewards for top performance. In line with a progressive learning approach, simulation training for participants will progress from low to high complexity simulators, starting with a bench-top model and then moving to the EndoVR virtual reality simulator. Performance will be assessed at three points: Pretraining, immediately post-training and 4-6 weeks after training. Assessments will take place on the simulator at all three time points and transfer of skills will be assessed during two clinical colonoscopies 4-6 weeks post-training. Mixed factorial ANOVAs will be used to determine if there is a performance difference between the two groups during simulated and clinical assessments.

EBUS-STAT Subscore Analysis to Predict the Efficacy and Assess the Validity of Virtual Reality Simulation for EBUS-TBNA Training among Experienced Bronchoscopists,"Scarlata, S.; Palermo, P.; Candoli, P.; Tofani, A.; Petitti, T.; Corbetta, L.","Background: Linear endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) represents a pivotal innovation in interventional pulmonology; determining the best approach to guarantee systematic and efficient training is expected to become a main issue in the forthcoming years. Virtual reality simulators have been proposed as potential EBUS-TBNA training instruments, to avoid unskilled beginners practicing directly in real-life settings. A validated and perfected simulation program could be used before allowing beginners to practice on patients. Our goal was to test the reliability of the EBUSSkills and Task Assessment Tool (STAT) and its subscores for measuring the competence of experienced bronchoscopists approaching EBUS-guided TBNA, using only the virtual reality simulator as both a training and an assessment tool. Method(s): Fifteen experienced bronchoscopists, with poor or no experience in EBUS-TBNA, participated in this study. They were all administered the Italian version of the EBUS-STAT evaluation tool, during a high-fidelity virtual reality simulation. This was followed by a single 7- hour theoretical and practical (on simulators) session on EBUS-TBNA, at the end of which their skills were reassessed by EBUS-STAT. Result(s): An overall, significant improvement in EBUSTBNA skills was observed, thereby confirming that (a) virtual reality simulation can facilitate practical learning among practitioners, and (b) EBUS-STAT is capable of detecting these improvements. The test's overall ability to detect differences was negatively influenced by the minimal variation of the scores relating to items 1 and 2, was not influenced by the training, and improved significantly when the 2 items were not considered. Apart from these 2 items, all the remaining subscores were equally capable of revealing improvements in the learner. Lastly, we found that trainees with presimulation EBUS-STAT scores above 79 did not show any significant improvement after virtual reality training, suggesting that this score represents a cutoff value capable of predicting the likelihood that simulation can be beneficial. Conclusion(s): Virtual reality simulation is capable of providing a practical learning tool for practitioners with previous experience in flexible bronchoscopy, and the EBUS-STAT questionnaire is capable of detecting these changes. A pretraining EBUS-STAT score below 79 is a good indicator of those candidates who will benefit from the simulation training. Further studies are needed to verify whether a modified version of the questionnaire would be capable of improving its performance among experienced bronchoscopists.

The Heidelberg VR Score: development and validation of a composite score for laparoscopic virtual reality training,"Schmidt, M. W.; Kowalewski, K. F.; Schmidt, M. L.; Wennberg, E.; Garrow, C. R.; Paik, S.; Benner, L.; Schijven, M. P.; Muller-Stich, B. P.; Nickel, F.","Introduction: Virtual reality (VR-)trainers are well integrated in laparoscopic surgical training. However, objective feedback is often provided in the form of single parameters, e.g., time or number of movements, making comparisons and evaluation of trainees' overall performance difficult. Therefore, a new standard for reporting outcome data is highly needed. The aim of this study was to create a weighted, expert-based composite score, to offer simple and direct evaluation of laparoscopic performance on common VR-trainers. Material(s) and Method(s): An integrated analytic hierarchy process-Delphi survey was conducted with 14 international experts to achieve a consensus on the importance of different skill categories and parameters in evaluation of laparoscopic performance. A scoring algorithm was established to allow comparability between tasks and VR-trainers. A weighted composite score was calculated for basic skills tasks and peg transfer on the LapMentorTM II and III and validated for both VR-trainers. Result(s): Five major skill categories (time, efficiency, safety, dexterity, and outcome) were identified and weighted in two Delphi rounds. Safety, with a weight of 67%, was determined the most important category, followed by efficiency with 17%. The LapMentorTM-specific score was validated using 15 (14) novices and 9 experts; the score was able to differentiate between both groups for basic skills tasks and peg transfer (LapMentorTM II: Exp: 86.5 +/- 12.7, Nov. 52.8 +/- 18.3; p < 0.001; LapMentorTM III: Exp: 80.8 +/- 7.1, Nov: 50.6 +/- 16.9; p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): An effective and simple performance measurement was established to propose a new standard in analyzing and reporting VR outcome data-the Heidelberg virtual reality (VR) score. The scoring algorithm and the consensus results on the importance of different skill aspects in laparoscopic surgery are universally applicable and can be transferred to any simulator or task. By incorporating specific expert baseline data for the respective task, comparability between tasks, studies, and simulators can be achieved.

Learning laparoscopic skills: Observation or practice?,"Schmitt, F.; Mariani, A.; Eyssartier, E.; Granry, J. C.; Podevin, G.","Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the respective roles of observation and direct practice in the retention of laparoscopic skills. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighteen fifth-year medical students were included in a two-session laparoscopic learning course. During the first session, each participant was given four tasks to complete from the ""Basic skills"" and ""Essential tasks"" modules of the Simbionix LAP MentorTM, and another four tasks for observation only. During the second session, each participant completed all eight tasks. Performance evaluation was assessed using the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) global rating scale and LAP Mentor metrics. Result(s): The mean OSATS score during the first session (S1) was 16.7 +/- 3.2. This increased by 34% during the second session (S2), reaching 21.8 +/- 2.6 in the group of former observer students (S2O, P < .0001), and by 56% (25.1 +/- 1.9) in the group of former practicing students (S2A, P < .0001). The analysis of LAP Mentor metrics showed that 14 of 28 parameters (50%) improved in the S2A group compared to S1, whereas only 25% of the parameters improved in the S2O group, the difference being significant (P = .048). In both groups, the more complex the task, the more the number of improved parameters decreased. Conclusion(s): Although simple observation of laparoscopic skills improved further performance, direct practice on the virtual reality trainer ensured more effective training. This work therefore advocates incorporating personal training on simulators into residents' surgical curricula. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.",2018,January,Journal of Laparoendoscopic and Advanced Surgical Techniques,28(1),,89-94,620284172,,,#4502,Schmitt 2018,,
Introducing augmented reality technology to enhance learning in pharmacy education: A pilot study,"Schneider, J.; Patfield, M.; Croft, H.; Salem, S.; Munro, I.","There is increasing use of augmented reality (AR) technology, which combines the virtual and real world, in the tertiary education sector. AR enables flexibility in student learning, since this technology may be used in the face to face setting and may also be accessed by students at any time outside of this setting. The purpose of this study was to develop an AR tool and investigate its effectiveness for learning about the medication naloxone using AR in a MagicBook; and determine student opinions on its acceptability and usability. Using a sequential explanatory, mixed method design, 25 undergraduate pharmacy students were recruited to participate in the study. Pre-and post-tests were used to measure changes in knowledge and a survey was used to collect information on the usability and acceptability of AR for learning. The findings of the study indicated that AR technology was able to support student learning on the chosen topic, showing 42% improvement in quiz score p < 0.0001, and that students found using AR was stimulating, interactive, engaging and easy to follow. Thus, AR technology could be an effective way to enhance student learning about medicines.

Metric based virtual simulation training for endovascular thrombectomy improves interventional neuroradiologists' simulator performance,"Schneider, M. S.; Sandve, K. O.; Kurz, K. D.; Dalen, I.; Ospel, J.; Goyal, M.; Kurz, M. W.; Fjetland, L.","Objective: Metric based virtual reality simulation training may enhance the capability of interventional neuroradiologists (INR) to perform endovascular thrombectomy. As pilot for a national simulation study we examined the feasibility and utility of simulated endovascular thrombectomy procedures on a virtual reality (VR) simulator. Method(s): Six INR and four residents participated in the thrombectomy skill training on a VR simulator (Mentice VIST 5G). Two different case-scenarios were defined as benchmark-cases, performed before and after VR simulator training. INR performing endovascular thrombectomy clinically were also asked to fill out a questionnaire analyzing their degree of expectation and general attitude towards VR simulator training. Result(s): All participants improved in mean total procedure time for both benchmark-cases. Experts showed significant improvements in handling errors (case 2), a reduction in contrast volume used (case 1 and 2), and fluoroscopy time (case 1 and 2). Novices showed a significant improvement in steps finished (case 2), a reduction in fluoroscopy time (case 1), and radiation used (case 1). Both, before and after having performed simulation training the participating INR had a positive attitude towards VR simulation training. Conclusion(s): VR simulation training enhances the capability of INR to perform endovascular thrombectomy on the VR simulator. INR have generally a positive attitude towards VR simulation training. Whether the VR simulation training translates to enhanced clinical performance will be evaluated in the ongoing Norwegian national simulation study.

Validation of a High-End Virtual Reality Simulator for Training Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumors,"Schulz, G. B.; Grimm, T.; Buchner, A.; Jokisch, F.; Casuscelli, J.; Kretschmer, A.; Mumm, J. N.; Ziegelmuller, B.; Stief, C. G.; Karl, A.","Objective: The oncological outcome in patients with bladder cancer (BC) significantly correlates with the quality of transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TUR-BT). Virtual reality (VR) training simulators have been developed to improve surgical skills. We evaluated the advantages and limitations of the novel Uro Trainer (UT) (Karl Storz GmbH, Germany) with respect to training for TUR-BT. Design(s): Participants underwent VR training based on 4 different TUR-BT cases accompanied by self-assessment and evaluation questionnaires. Results were compared between experienced endourologists and novices, and furthermore, correlated with self-rated capabilities for content and construct validity. Student's t tests, Pearson's correlation, and chi-squared tests were performed for statistical evaluation. Setting(s): The study was performed at the tertiary care urological department of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. Participant(s): A total of 22 urological physicians, including residents and consultants, were included in the study. Result(s): There is a need to improve TUR-BT training as 27.3% of the participants had already experienced overtaxing situations during TUR-BT and only a few reported of high satisfaction with the classical ""see one-do one"" teaching mode. Construct validity was demonstrated, as consultants achieved significantly higher overall scores (p < 0.001) and safety (p = 0.004) and visualization (p = 0.001) subscores. Interestingly, the self-assessed capability to perform a TUR-BT correlated significantly (p = 0.01) with overall UT scores. Significant progress of self-rated abilities was shown for several parameters, including inspection (p = 0.046) and resection (p = 0.026). Although participants indicated improvements in several procedural skills and overall benefit of the VR training with the UT was rated 4.6 on a 5-point scale by consultants, limitations of the UT were demonstrated predominantly for tissue feedback and authenticity of different tissue layers. Conclusion(s): The novel VR simulator showed a high face and construct validity, and therefore has a great potential to complement endourological training.

Benefits and Limitations of Transurethral Resection of the Prostate Training With a Novel Virtual Reality Simulator,"Schulz, G. B.; Grimm, T.; Kretschmer, A.; Stief, C. G.; Jokisch, F.; Karl, A.","PURPOSE: Profound endourological skills are required for optimal postoperative outcome parameters after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). We investigated the Karl Storz (Tuttlingen, Germany) UroTrainer for virtual simulation training of the TURP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty urologists underwent a virtual reality (VR) TURP training. After a needs analysis, performance scores and self-rated surgical skills were compared before and after the curriculum, the realism of the simulator was assessed, and the optimal level of experience for VR training was evaluated. Statistical testing was done with SPSS 25. RESULT(S): Forty percent of participants indicated frequent intraoperative overload during real-life TURP and 80% indicated that VR training might be beneficial for endourological skills development, underlining the need to advance classical endourological training. For the complete cohort, overall VR performance scores (P = 0.022) and completeness of resection (P < 0.001) significantly improved. Self-rated parameters including identification of anatomical structures (P = 0.046), sparing the sphincter (P = 0.002), and handling of the resectoscope (P = 0.033) became significantly better during the VR curriculum. Participants indicated progress regarding handling of the resectoscope (70%), bleeding control (55%), and finding the correct resection depth (50%). Although overall realism and handling of the resectoscope was good, virtual bleeding control and correct tissue feedback should be improved in future VR simulators. Seventy percent of participants indicated 10 to 50 virtual TURP cases to be optimal and 80% junior residents to be the key target group for VR TURP training. CONCLUSION(S): There is a need to improve training the TURP and VR simulators might be a valuable supplement, especially for urologists beginning with the endourological desobstruction of the prostate.",2020,1-Feb,Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,15(1),,14-20,629916545,,,#4525,Schulz 2020,,

Face and content validity of XperienceTM Team Trainer: bed-side assistant training simulator for robotic surgery,"Sessa, L.; Perrenot, C.; Xu, S.; Hubert, J.; Bresler, L.; Brunaud, L.; Perez, M.","In robotic surgery, the coordination between the console-side surgeon and bed-side assistant is crucial, more than in standard surgery or laparoscopy where the surgical team works in close contact. XperienceTM Team Trainer (XTT) is a new optional component for the dv-Trainer platform and simulates the patient-side working environment. We present preliminary results for face, content, and the workload imposed regarding the use of the XTT virtual reality platform for the psychomotor and communication skills training of the bed-side assistant in robot-assisted surgery. Participants were categorized into ""Beginners"" and ""Experts"". They tested a series of exercises (Pick & Place Laparoscopic Demo, Pick & Place 2 and Team Match Board 1) and completed face validity questionnaires. ""Experts"" assessed content validity on another questionnaire. All the participants completed a NASA Task Load Index questionnaire to assess the workload imposed by XTT. Twenty-one consenting participants were included (12 ""Beginners"" and 9 ""Experts""). XTT was shown to possess face and content validity, as evidenced by the rankings given on the simulator's ease of use and realism parameters and on the simulator's usefulness for training. Eight out of nine ""Experts"" judged the visualization of metrics after the exercises useful. However, face validity has shown some weaknesses regarding interactions and instruments. Reasonable workload parameters were registered. XTT demonstrated excellent face and content validity with acceptable workload parameters.

"A methodological, task-based approach to Procedure-Specific Simulations training","Setty, Y.; Salzman, O.","Purpose: Procedure-Specific Simulations (PSS) are 3D realistic simulations that provide a platform to practice complete surgical procedures in a virtual-reality environment. While PSS have the potential to improve surgeons' proficiency, there are no existing standards or guidelines for PSS development in a structured manner. Method(s): We employ a unique platform inspired by game design to develop virtual reality simulations in three dimensions of urethrovesical anastomosis during radical prostatectomy. 3D visualization is supported by a stereo vision, providing a fully realistic view of the simulation. The software can be executed for any robotic surgery platform. Specifically, we tested the simulation under windows environment on the RobotiX Mentor. Result(s): Using urethrovesical anastomosis during radical prostatectomy simulation as a representative example, we present a task-based methodological approach to PSS training. The methodology provides tasks in increasing levels of difficulty from a novice level of basic anatomy identification, to an expert level that permits testing new surgical approaches. Conclusion(s): The modular methodology presented here can be easily extended to support more complex tasks. We foresee this methodology as a tool used to integrate PSS as a complementary training process for surgical procedures.

Reprint of: Computer-Based Simulation Training in Surgery,"Seymour, N. E.","Computer-based simulation training methods have emerged in mainstream residency training in response to evolving educational demands. These methods include surgical virtual reality (VR), computer driven full patient simulation, and screen-based simulations, of which immersive virtual environments reflect the most recent area of development. Over a single decade, surgical VR has progressed from demonstration of concept to a practical training tool, with a body of validation literature for part-task VR trainers that supports their expanded use, as well as the development of more robust and capable systems to satisfy the need for procedural training. Patient simulation is gradually entering surgical residency training for crisis resource management and team training that might not otherwise be feasible outside clinical settings. In the future, simulation of patient care in virtual environments may constitute a similar experience without the resource demands associated with full patient simulation. Collectively, the use of computers to create simulated learning experiences for surgeons is representative of an experiential learning model that has been far more developed in other undertakings, but which will certainly be more relied on in surgical training in the future.

Student perspective on using a virtual radiography simulation,"Shanahan, M.","Aim Virtual radiography allows students to practice a range of radiographic techniques in a safe learning environment. The aim of this pilot study was to introduce Projection VRTM, a software simulation, into the academic environment and harvest user feedback about the application. Methods Purposefully designed worksheets were developed to support the implementation of Projection VRTM into the laboratory component of an undergraduate diagnostic radiography course. Following completion of the course, all enrolled students (N = 86) were invited to complete an online survey to ascertain student perceptions on technical issues and educational value of the software. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied. Results Responses were received from 84 students (response rate 98%). The student cohort had a range of confidence levels in their computer technology ability, with significant relationships observed for gender (p = 0.025) and age group (p = 0.016). Few students (19) had previously used simulation software. Overall students were positive regarding ease of use (83%) and ability to control the equipment as needed (89%). Primary benefits of using the simulation included allowing students to repeat activities until satisfied with the results (95%) and being able to quickly see images and understand if changes needed to be made (94%). Students reported the simulation positively developed their technical (78%), image evaluation (85%), problem solving (85%) and self-evaluation (88%) abilities.

Role of Visuohaptic Surgical Training Simulator in Resident Education of Orthopedic Surgery,"Shi, J.; Hou, Y.; Lin, Y.; Chen, H.; Yuan, W.","Objective: We sought to assess the validity of a virtual surgical training system on lumbar pedicle screw placement for residents. Method(s): Ten inexperienced residents were randomly assigned to the simulation training (ST) group (n = 5) and control group (n = 5). The ST group performed the lumbar pedicle screw placement on the virtual surgical training system, and the control group was given an introductory teaching session before the cadaver test. A total of 8 adult fresh cadavers including 5 males and 3 females were collected and randomly allocated to the 2 groups. Each group performed the bilateral L1-L5 pedicle screw instrumentation in the cadaver specimens, respectively. Accuracy was assessed by computed tomography after instrumentation. The screw penetration rates, acceptable rates, and average screw penetration distance of the 2 groups were compared using statistical analysis. Result(s): The screw penetration rate of the ST group (12.5%) was significantly lower than the control group (37.5%, P < 0.05). The screw acceptable rates in ST and control groups were 100% and 85%, respectively, with statistical differences between each other (P < 0.05). There was also a statistically significant difference of the average screw penetration distance between the ST (1.37 +/- 0.62 mm) group and control group (2.42 +/- 0.51 mm, P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The virtual surgery simulation with greater accuracy is superior to the traditional teaching methods in surgical training of pedicle screw placement and can be used as a promising alternative for training of neurosurgical procedures.

Comparison of effective teaching methods to achieve skill acquisition using a robotic virtual reality simulator Expert proctoring versus an educational video versus independent training,"Shim, J. S.; Kim, J. Y.; Pyun, J. H.; Cho, S.; Oh, M. M.; Kang, S. H.; Lee, J. G.; Kim, J. J.; Cheon, J.; Kang, S. G.","Background: To compare the superiority of teaching methods for acquiring a proficient level of surgical skill in a robotic surgery-naive individual using a robotic virtual reality simulator. Method(s): This study employed a prospective, randomized study design to assess student's learning curve. We divided 45 subjects into 3 groups: those with expert proctoring (group I), those who watched only an educational video (group II), and those with independent training (group III; n = 15 per group). The task used in this study was the Tube 2 and it imitates a vesicourethral anastomosis in robotic prostatectomy. The effects were analyzed by the time to end the task after overcoming the learning curve which is determined by several performance parameters. Result(s): The number of task repetitions required to reach the learning curve plateau was 45, 42, and 37 repetitions in groups I, II, and III, which means that there was continuous improvement in performing the task after 40 repetitions only in groups I and II. The mean time for completing the task during the stabilization period was significantly different between group I and group III and group II and group III, which means that the independent training method was inferior to the other methods (group I vs. group II vs. group III: 187.38 vs. 187.07 vs. 253.47 seconds, P < .001). Conclusion(s): This study's findings showed that an educational video can be as beneficial as expert proctoring, which implies that the development of a standardized educational video would be worthwhile.

Validating a standardized laparoscopy curriculum for gynecology residents: a randomized controlled trial,"Shore, E. M.; Grantcharov, T. P.; Husslein, H.; Shirreff, L.; Dedy, N. J.; McDermott, C. D.; Lefebvre, G. G.","Background Residency programs struggle with integrating simulation training into curricula, despite evidence that simulation leads to improved operating room performance and patient outcomes. Currently, there is no standardized laparoscopic training program available for gynecology residents. Objective The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a comprehensive ex vivo training curriculum for gynecologic laparoscopy. Study Design In a prospective, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force Classification I) postgraduate year 1 and 2 gynecology residents were allocated randomly to receive either conventional residency training or an evidence-based laparoscopy curriculum. The 7-week curriculum consisted of cognitive didactic and interactive sessions, low-fidelity box trainer and high-fidelity virtual reality simulator technical skills, and high-fidelity team simulation. The primary outcome measure was the technical procedure score at laparoscopic salpingectomy with the use of the objective structured assessment of laparoscopic salpingectomy tool. Secondary outcome measures related to performance in multiple-choice questions and technical performance at box trainer and virtual reality simulator tasks. A sample size of 10 residents per group was planned (n = 20). Results are reported as medians (interquartile ranges), and data were compared between groups with the Mann-Whitney U, chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests (P <=.05). Results In July 2013, 27 residents were assigned randomly (14 curriculum, 13 conventional). Both groups were similar at baseline. Twenty-one residents (10 curriculum, 11 conventional) completed the surgical procedure-based assessment in the operating room (September to December 2013). Our primary outcome indicated that curriculum-trained residents displayed superior performance at laparoscopic salpingectomy (P =.043). Secondary outcomes demonstrated that curriculum-trained residents had higher performance scores on the cognitive multiple-choice questions (P <.001), the nontechnical skills multiple-choice questions (P =.016), box trainer task time (P <.001), and all virtual reality simulator parameters. Conclusion Participation in a comprehensive simulation-based training curriculum for gynecologic laparoscopy leads to a superior improvement in knowledge and technical performance in the operating room compared with conventional residency training.

Communication skills training using virtual reality: A descriptive qualitative study,"Shorey, S.; Ang, E.; Ng, E. D.; Yap, J.; Lau, L. S. T.; Chui, C. K.","BACKGROUND: Modern medical pedagogical strategies are shifting toward the use of virtual patient simulations. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to examine students' users' attitudes and experiences and clinical facilitators' perspectives on student performances in the clinical setting post-virtual patient training. DESIGN: A descriptive qualitative study design was used. SETTING: Nursing faculty at a local university in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS: 24 nursing undergraduates and six clinical facilitators. METHOD(S): This study is a follow-up of an experimental study on the Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence (VCAAI). The study took place from the academic year 2017/2018 ended in November 2019. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted. All interviews and focus group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULT(S): Two overarching themes (students' virtual patient user experience and clinical facilitators' evaluations of students' clinical communication skills) comprising six themes were generated. Themes under students' user experience included: 1) attitudes toward virtual patient training, 2) virtual patient's role in student development, and 3) enhanced features and implementation suggestions. Themes under clinical facilitators' evaluations included: 1) insights on students' communication skills and 2) approaches to improve communication skills. An overlapping theme titled 'value of technology in teaching communication' comprised of mutual feedback from both students and clinical facilitators. Early implementation, continued accessibility, enhancing realism and technological improvements to the VCAAI were listed as key areas for program improvement, while increased situational sensitivity and language training are recommended to further enhance students' communication skills. CONCLUSION(S): The mixed attitudes toward virtual patient interactions and recognitions of the benefits of virtual patient simulations suggest the potential effectiveness of the use of virtual patients in teaching effective nursing communication skills. However, the lack of authenticity and other limitations need to be addressed before official implementations of such trainings with virtual patients to undergraduate nursing curricula.

A Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence for Communication Skills Training in Nursing Education: Development Study,"Shorey, S.; Ang, E.; Yap, J.; Ng, E. D.; Lau, S. T.; Chui, C. K.","BACKGROUND: The ability of nursing undergraduates to communicate effectively with health care providers, patients, and their family members is crucial to their nursing professions as these can affect patient outcomes. However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. METHOD(S): The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. RESULT(S): The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. CONCLUSION(S): The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.

N.; Mehta, N.","BACKGROUND: Urogynecologic surgery, transvaginal pelvic floor surgery in particular, requires learning by feel and high-volume pattern recognition. In the era of limited duty hours and case numbers, we sought to develop a curriculum, one that can be self-guided, to help trainees develop a spatial understanding of the relationships of pelvic floor musculature, ligamentous supports, and surrounding neurovasculature outside of the operating room. INSTRUMENT: We created and piloted an innovative interactive holographic using an augmented reality headset to teach surgical anatomy, procedural steps, recognition, and management of the uterosacral ligament suspension and sacrospinous ligament fixation, the two most common native tissue vaginal prolapse repairs. EXPERIENCE: Our curriculum was independently trialed by obstetrics and gynecology residents and subspecialty fellows and was widely accepted by trainees, postgraduate levels 1-6. As compared with usual self-study, 88% ranked the modules as ""much"" or ""very much better"" and 81% would be ""likely"" or ""very likely"" to use mixed reality smartglasses to prepare for surgery.

Design(s): Retrospective analysis of VR Simulation metrics. Setting(s): Two training institutions. Patients or participants: Residents, fellows and practicing surgeons. Intervention(s): Analysis of the Mimic robotic Virtual Reality (VR)-Simulation database of over 600,000 sessions was utilized to calculate Mean scores for each exercise. Those Mean scores were then normalized to 100. Subject's scores were also averaged and normalized to 100. We called this Index score the MScore Proficiency Index (MPI<sup>©</sup>). Scores above 100 were better than average; Less than 100 were worse than average. Measurements and Main Results: Seventeen thousand six hundred and forty eight sessions were analyzed (2017-2020) comparing 77 students (residents to practicing surgeons) working in 7 different curriculums. On average, each student spent 8 h and 24 min on simulation, attempted 26.5 different exercises, and became proficient in 20.6 exercises per user. The MPI<sup>©</sup> mean score for all participants in all curricula was an MPI<sup>©</sup> of 104.9 (SD: 15.5).

The aim was to develop a step-wise structured virtual reality (VR) curriculum for LA to allow junior surgeons to hone their skills in a safe and controlled environment. Method(s): A prospective randomized study was designed using a high-fidelity VR simulator. Thirty-five novices and 25 experts participated in the assessment and their performances were compared to assess construct validity. Learning curve analysis was performed. Result(s): Five of the psychomotor tasks and all appendicectomy tasks showed construct validity. Learning was demonstrated in the majority of construct-valid tasks. A novel goal-directed VR curriculum for LA was constructed. Conclusion(s): A step-wise structured VR curriculum for LA is proposed with a framework which includes computer generated metrics and supports deliberate practice, spacing intervals, human instruction/feedback and assessment. Future study should test the feasibility of its implementation and transferability of acquired skill.

Development of a proficiency-based virtual reality simulation training curriculum for laparoscopic appendicectomy,"Sirimanna, P.; Gladman, M. A.","BACKGROUND: Proficiency-based virtual reality (VR) training curricula improve intraoperative performance, but have not been developed for laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA). This study aimed to develop an evidence-based training curriculum for LA. METHODS: A total of 10 experienced (>50 LAs), eight intermediate (10-30 LAs) and 20 inexperienced (<10 LAs) operators performed guided and unguided LA tasks on a high-fidelity VR simulator using internationally relevant techniques. The ability to differentiate levels of experience (construct validity) was measured using simulator-derived metrics. Learning curves were analysed. Proficiency benchmarks were defined by the performance of the experienced group. Intermediate and experienced participants completed a questionnaire to evaluate the realism (face validity) and relevance (content validity). RESULTS: Of 18 surgeons, 16 (89%) considered the VR model to be visually realistic and 17 (95%) believed that it was representative of actual practice. All 'guided' modules demonstrated construct validity (P < 0.05), with learning curves that plateaued between sessions 6 and 9 (P < 0.01). When comparing inexperienced to intermediates to experienced, the 'unguided' LA module demonstrated construct validity for economy of motion (5.00 versus 7.17 versus 7.84, respectively; P < 0.01) and task time (864.5 s versus 477.2 s versus 352.1 s, respectively, P < 0.01). Construct validity was also confirmed for number of movements, path length and idle time. Validated modules were used for curriculum construction, with proficiency benchmarks used as performance goals. CONCLUSION: A VR LA model was realistic and representative of actual practice and was validated as a training and assessment tool. Consequently, the first evidence-based internationally applicable training curriculum for LA was constructed, which facilitates skill acquisition to proficiency.

Adaptive Virtual Reality Training to Optimize Military Medical Skills Acquisition and Retention,"Siu, K. C.; Best, B. J.; Kim, J. W.; Oleynikov, D.; Ritter, F. E.","The Department of Defense has pursued the integration of virtual reality simulation into medical training and applications to fulfill the need to train 100,000 military health care personnel annually. Medical personnel transitions, both when entering an operational area and returning to the civilian theater, are characterized by the need to rapidly reacquire skills that are essential but have decayed through disuse or infrequent use. Improved efficiency in reacquiring such skills is critical to avoid the likelihood of mistakes that may result in mortality and morbidity. We focus here on a study testing a theory of how the skills required for minimally invasive surgery for military surgeons are learned and retained. Our adaptive virtual reality surgical training system will incorporate an intelligent mechanism for tracking performance that will recognize skill deficiencies and generate an optimal adaptive training schedule. Our design is modeling skill acquisition based on a skill retention theory. The complexity of appropriate training tasks is adjusted according to the level of retention and/or surgical experience. Based on preliminary work, our system will improve the capability to interactively assess the level of skills learning and decay, optimizes skill relearning across levels of surgical experience, and positively impact skill maintenance. Our system could eventually reduce mortality and morbidity by providing trainees with the reexperience they need to help make a transition between operating theaters. This article reports some data that will support adaptive tutoring of minimally invasive surgery and similar surgical skills.

Machine learning distinguishes neurosurgical skill levels in a virtual reality tumor resection task,"Siyar, S.; Azarnoush, H.; Rashidi, S.; Winkler-Schwartz, A.; Bissonnette, V.; Ponnudurai, N.; Del Maestro, R. F.","This study outlines the first investigation of application of machine learning to distinguish ""skilled"" and ""novice"" psychomotor performance during a virtual reality (VR) brain tumor resection task. Tumor resection task participants included 23 neurosurgeons and senior neurosurgery residents as the ""skilled"" group and 92 junior neurosurgery residents and medical students as the ""novice"" group. The task involved removing a series of virtual brain tumors without causing injury to surrounding tissue. Originally, 150 features were extracted followed by statistical and forward feature selection. The selected features were provided to 4 classifiers, namely, K-Nearest Neighbors, Parzen Window, Support Vector Machine, and Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbors. Sets of 5 to 30 selected features were provided to the classifiers. A working point of 15 premium features resulted in accuracy values as high as 90% using the Supprt Vector Machine. The obtained results highlight the potentials of machine learning, applied to VR simulation data, to help realign the traditional apprenticeship educational paradigm to a more objective model, based on proven performance standards.

Virtual simulation training: Imaged experience of dementia,"Slater, P.; Hasson, F.; Gillen, P.; Gallen, A.; Parlour, R.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The need to provide an empathic response to the care of people with dementia has long been advocated. Virtual reality-based programmes continue to gain momentum across health sectors, becoming an innovative tool that provides staff with the opportunity to experience a dementia-like experience within a relatively short time frame. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of an interactive training experience on moral, emotive, behavioural and cognitive elements of empathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative exploratory design was adopted employing purposive sampling to identify participants, aged over 18 years, who participated in the Virtual Dementia Tour (VDT) programme. Interviews were conducted over a two-month period, and qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULT(S): The four components (moral, emotive, behavioural and cognitive) of empathy were reflected in findings. Overall the interactive training programme was perceived as useful, and emotionally, it provided an opportunity to ""imagine what it is to live with dementia,"" enabling a cognitive, moral and behavioural reflection to occur, enhancing the empathic state. DISCUSSION: In this study, the VDT provides a different way of learning, with participants reporting the emergence of an empathic response. Results suggest that the emotional response laid the foundations to the behavioural or cognitive (objective and subjective) reaction which was underpinned by a moral reaction. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Virtual reality programmes are one step in the process for healthcare professionals caring empathetically for people with dementia; however, further research is required.

Development and use of augmented reality models to teach medicinal chemistry,"Smith, C.; Friel, C. J.","Background and purpose: Students in the doctor of pharmacy curriculum have varied backgrounds in their chemical training and also their ability to make mental conversions from two-dimensional chemical representations, on lecture slides or textbook images, to three-dimensional cognitive understanding. In order to bridge the gap, augmented reality (AR) models were developed to provide an alternative learning medium for the students. AR was selected to take advantage of the ubiquitous presence of smartphones, without incurring the expense of Virtual Reality hardware. Educational Activity and Setting: AR models were developed and introduced in the classroom in three phases. Student survey responses were used to improve the utility of the models in between phases. Active learning exercises were developed that required both individual and group interactions to complete. Finding(s): An optimized AR model creation workflow was developed that allowed each AR model to be created and posted in about 30 min. Depending on the phase of the study, 69% to 88% of the students found the AR models easy to use and 58% to 83% wanted to see more AR models used in future lectures. A majority (76%) of the students viewed the AR models on their smartphones. Augmented reality modules were created for use in medicinal chemistry courses in the pharmacy curriculum. Models were introduced in phases and included iterative improvements based on student feedback. The AR exercises provided active learning opportunities and were well received. The majority of students would like additional AR modules used in the course.

Utilization of a virtual patient for advanced assessment of student performance in pain management,"Smith, M. A.; Waite, L. H.","Background and purpose To assess student performance and achievement of course objectives following the integration of a virtual patient case designed to promote active, patient-centered learning in a required pharmacy course. Educational activity and setting DecisionSimTM (Kynectiv, Inc., Chadsford, PA), a dynamic virtual patient platform, was used to implement an interactive patient case to augment pain management material presented during a didactic session in a pharmacotherapy course. Simulation performance data were collected and analyzed. Student exam performance on pain management questions was compared to student exam performance on nearly identical questions from a prior year when a paper-based case was used instead of virtual patient technology. Findings Students who performed well on the virtual patient case performed better on exam questions related to patient assessment (p = 0.0244), primary pharmacological therapy (p = 0.0001), and additional pharmacological therapy (p = 0.0001). Overall exam performance did not differ between the two groups. However, students with exposure to the virtual patient case demonstrated significantly better performance on higher level Bloom's Taxonomy questions that required them to create pharmacotherapy regimens (p=0.0005). Students in the previous year (exposed only to a paper patient case) performed better in calculating conversions of opioids for patients (p = 0.0001). Summary Virtual patient technology may enhance student performance on high-level Bloom's Taxonomy examination questions. This study adds to the current literature demonstrating the value of virtual patient technology as an active-learning strategy.

Evaluation of two simulation methods for teaching a disaster skill,"Smith, S.; Farra, S. L.; Hodgson, E.","Introduction With increasing use of virtual reality simulation (VRS) in nursing education, there is a paucity of research exploring learning outcomes following training with VRS as compared with traditional mannequin-based simulation. Given the resource intensive nature of mannequin-based simulation, especially for disaster education, understanding outcomes from newer technologies like VRS are needed. Methods A quasi-experimental design was used to examine the differences in learning outcomes for the disaster skill of decontamination, based on type of simulation. The study was framed by the National Leage for Nursing (NLN) Jeffries Simulation Theory, with participant outcomes identified by the framework (satisfaction, self-confidence and performance). Outcomes were measured using the NLN Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning scale and a Decontamination Checklist. Senior nursing students in the final semester of a baccalaureate nursing programme were recruited to participate during one of their scheduled laboratory days. Following a didactic presentation, students were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (VRS or mannequin-based simulation training) to learn the skill of decontamination. Results A total of 121 participants took part in the study. No statistically significant results were noted for any of the study outcomes: performance (accuracy and time), satisfaction and self-efficacy. Results of the study demonstrate that VRS is as effective as mannequin-based simulation in training participants for the skill of decontamination. Conclusions Simulation-based education experiences must be matched to learning outcomes and evaluated for effectiveness. As evidence emerges regarding use of newer technologies, like VRS, educators will have more options for providing students with opportunities that best match available resources.

The role of virtual reality simulation in surgical training in the light of COVID-19 pandemic Visual spatial ability as a predictor for improved surgical performance: a randomized trial,"Sommer, G. M.; Broschewitz, J.; Huppert, S.; Sommer, C. G.; Jahn, N.; Jansen-Winkeln, B.; Gockel, I.; Hans-Michael, H.","Introduction: Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, surgical training has become increasingly challenging due to required social distancing. Therefore, the use of virtual reality (VR)-simulation could be a helpful tool for imparting surgical skills, especially in minimally invasive environments. Visual spatial ability (VSA) might influence the learning curve for laparoscopic surgical skills. However, little is known about the influence of VSA for surgical novices on VR-simulator training regarding the complexity of different tasks over a long-term training period. Our study evaluated prior VSA and VSA development in surgical trainees during VR-simulator training, and its influence on surgical performance in simulator training. Method(s): In our single-center prospective two-arm randomized trial, VSA was measured with a tube figure test before curriculum training. After 1:1 randomization, the training group (TG) participated in the entire curriculum training consisting of 48 different VR-simulator tasks with varying difficulty over a continuous nine-day training session. The control group (CG) performed two of these tasks on day 1 and 9. Correlation and regression analyses were used to assess the influence of VSA on VR-related surgical skills and to measure procedural abilities. Result(s): Sixty students (33 women) were included. Significant improvements in the TG in surgical performance and faster completion times were observed from days 1 to 9 for the scope orientation 30degree right-handed (SOR), and cholecystectomy dissection tasks after the structured 9-day training program. After training, the TG with pre-existing low VSA scores achieved performance levels similar to those with pre-existing high VSA scores for the two VR simulator tasks. Significant correlations between VSA and surgical performance on complex laparoscopic camera navigation SOR tasks were found before training. Conclusion(s): Our study revealed that that all trainees improved their surgical skills irrespective of previous VSA during structured VR simulator training.

The Surgical Skill of a Novice Trainee Manifests in Time-Consuming Exercises of a Virtual Simulator Rather Than a Quick-Finishing Counterpart: A Concurrent Validity Study Using an Urethrovesical Anastomosis Model,"Song, P. H.; Ko, Y. H.","Objective The purpose of this study is to determine an optimal training curriculum using a robotic virtual simulator (RVS) that enables unexperienced trainees to perform a complex task in a hands-on setting. Patients and Methods This study was conducted in 2 phases. In the RVS phase, 43 participants sequentially completed 12 exercises consistent with all primary exercises in the EndoWrist manipulation and advanced needle-driving category, until the overall score reached more than 80% by repeated practice. In the hands-on phase using a robotic surgical system, 10 randomly selected trainees performed 8 sutures once, simulating urethrovesical anastomosis, and the console time was recorded. Results The median total time and total attempts for the RVS phase was 195.2 minutes and 54 times, respectively. The trainees were divided by median total time, and times to accomplish each RVS exercise were then compared between the early- and the late-completion groups; among 12 exercises trained, 6 exercises (prolonged course) requiring significantly more time in the late-completion group were identified. The prolonged course occupied 88.18% of the total time and 77.61% of the total attempts. For participants the in hands-on phase, a multiple linear regression model showed that the time to accomplish the prolonged course was a single independent predictor of the console time (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.524, B = 0.05; p = 0.018). Conclusion After establishment of a high standard cutoff score, the time spent for the prolonged course showed a significant association with console time in hands-on training simulating urethrovesical anastomosis, implying educational efficacy of training involving time-consuming exercise in performance of a complex task.

Immersive virtual reality as a teaching tool for neuroanatomy,"Stepan, K.; Zeiger, J.; Hanchuk, S.; Del Signore, A.; Shrivastava, R.; Govindaraj, S.; Iloreta, A.","Background: Three-dimensional (3D) computer modeling and interactive virtual reality (VR) simulation are validated teaching techniques used throughout medical disciplines. Little objective data exists supporting its use in teaching clinical anatomy. Learner motivation is thought to limit the rate of utilization of such novel technologies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, satisfaction, and motivation associated with immersive VR simulation in teaching medical students neuroanatomy. Method(s): Images of normal cerebral anatomy were reconstructed from human Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) computed tomography (CT) imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into 3D VR formats compatible with the Oculus Rift VR System, a head-mounted display with tracking capabilities allowing for an immersive VR experience. The ventricular system and cerebral vasculature were highlighted and labeled to create a focused interactive model. We conducted a randomized controlled study with 66 medical students (33 in both the control and experimental groups). Pertinent neuroanatomical structures were studied using either online textbooks or the VR interactive model, respectively. We then evaluated the students' anatomy knowledge, educational experience, and motivation (using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey [IMMS], a previously validated assessment). Result(s): There was no significant difference in anatomy knowledge between the 2 groups on preintervention, postintervention, or retention quizzes.

"A Virtual, Simulated Code White for Undergraduate Nursing Students","Stephen, T.; King, K.; Taylor, M.; Jackson, M.; Hilario, C.","BACKGROUND: Nurses and nursing students are increasingly vulnerable to workplace violence, both verbal and physical, as health care settings and clients cope with unprecedented challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic. Concurrently, clinical learning opportunities for nursing students have been curtailed by public health restrictions and limited capacity. While virtual simulations have been promoted as an alternative to clinical hours, their effectiveness as an educational intervention on workplace violence has yet to be assessed. PURPOSE: The authors sought to evaluate a virtual, simulated code white-a set of organized responses to a client, visitor, or staff member exhibiting the potential for violence-involving 4th year undergraduate nursing students, randomly sorted into an intervention group and a control group. METHOD(S): Pre and post test measures of knowledge and attitudes about mental health, workplace violence and virtual simulation were collected, as well as qualitative data from focus groups. FINDINGS: While the sample size (n=24) was insufficient to detect meaningful differences between the intervention and control groups, descriptive statistics and focus group data revealed significant gaps in participants' knowledge around managing workplace violence. Participants rated the virtual simulation highly for its realism and the opportunity to experience working in a virtual environment, while they felt the preamble and debrief were too short.

With the standard otology lectures, the control group had a 31% improvement in their post-test score (mean +/- standard error of the mean, 30.4 +/- 1.5) compared with their pretest score (23.3 +/- 1.8) (P <.001). The simulator group had the addition of OtoTrain to the otology lectures, and their score improved by 71% on their post-test (37.8 +/- 1.6) compared to their pretest (22.1 +/- 1.9) (P <.001). Comparing the post-test results, the simulator group had a 24% higher score than the control group (P <.002). Inter-rater reliability between the blinded evaluators was excellent (r = 0.953, P <.001). Conclusion(s): The use of OtoTrain increased the diagnostic otoscopic performance in novice learners. OtoTrain may be an effective teaching adjunct for undergraduate medical students. Level of Evidence: 1b. Laryngoscope, 127:1306-1311, 2017.

Study on augmented reality for robotic surgery bedside assistants,"Stewart, C. L.; Fong, A.; Payyavula, G.; DiMaio, S.; Lafaro, K.; Tallmon, K.; Wren, S.; Sorger, J.; Fong, Y.","Robotic surgery bedside assistants play an important role in robotic procedures by performing intra-corporeal tasks while accommodating the physical presence of the robot. We hypothesized that an augmented reality headset enabling 3D intra-corporeal vision while facing the surgical field could decrease time and improve accuracy of robotic bedside tasks. Bedside assistants (one physician assistant, one medical student, three surgical trainees, and two attending surgeons) performed validated tasks within a mock abdominal cavity with a surgical robot docked. Tasks were performed with a bedside monitor providing 2D or 3D vision, or an optical see-through head-mounted augmented reality device with 2D or 3D vision. The effect of augmented reality device resolution on performance was also evaluated. For the simplest task of touching a straw, performance was generally high, regardless of mode of visualization. With more complex tasks, including stapling and pulling a ring along a path, 3D augmented reality decreased time and number of errors per task. 3D augmented reality allowed the physician assistant to perform at the level of an attending surgeon using 3D augmented reality (p = 0.08). All participants had improved times for the ring path task with better resolution (lower resolution 23 +/- 11 s vs higher resolution 14 +/- 4 s, p = 0.002). 3D augmented reality vision with high resolution decreased time and improved accuracy of more complex tasks, enabling a less experienced robotic surgical bedside assistant to function similar to attending surgeons. These data warrant further study with additional complex tasks and bedside assistants at various levels of training.

Building a Handoff Communication Virtual Experience for Nursing Students Using Virtual Humans,"Stuart, J.; Aul, K.; Bumbach, M. D.; Stephen, A.; Lok, B.","Effective communication among healthcare professionals is critical to delivering safe, high-quality patient care. One important real-world skill that nursing students must acquire is generating accurate handoff communication reports. The central aim of this study was to build, assess, and revise a virtual experience simulation that allows nursing students to observe a standardized clinical situation in an immersive environment and then practice the situation-background-assessment-recommendation communication method. This between-groups experimental study, which was modified in light of COVID-19 concerns, evaluated how well 69 prelicensure nursing students understood a handoff communication report after viewing a virtual human patient and nurse interact during a triage assessment scenario. Results indicate student comprehension levels did not differ based on which of two metacognitive learning strategies was used. Participants in both study groups were able to accurately complete a situation-background-assessment-recommendation instrument based on the virtual experience. Further, they believed that watching a virtual nurse perform a triage assessment would help them perform one themselves in a similar virtual environment. There was also an unexpected study finding related to patient safety within the context of the simulation. This finding warrants further research that will lead to revision of the virtual experience used to train future nurses. Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Haptic-based virtual reality simulator for lateral ventricle puncture operation,"Su, X. H.; Deng, Z.; He, B. W.; Liu, Y. Q.","Background: The implementation of lateral ventricle puncture (LVP) operation is challenging due to the complex anatomy structure of human brains. Surgical simulator has been proved to be effective in surgical training. However, few works consider the integration of visual and haptic feedback. Method(s): Aim at achieving a realistic haptic interaction, this paper proposes a haptic-based virtual reality (VR) simulator for the LVP operation. In this simulator, we first reconstruct the three-dimension (3D) model of human brains for tissue/instrument interaction. Then a preoperative planning method based on geometry analysis is introduced to find the feasible entry point of LVP operation. A hierarchical bounding-box collision detection approach is proposed to render haptic feedback that is transferred to humans. Finally, a set of experiments on the proposed simulator and 3D printed models of human brains is carried out. Result(s): Two sets of experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed haptic-based simulator: experiments in the simulator and experiments on a 3D printed brain model. The proposed simulator allows neurosurgeons to train the LVP operation by visualizing the 3D virtual human brain and feeling realistic haptic feedback. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that the proposed haptic-based VR simulator can improve the performance of the LVP operation effectively and reduce the operation time.

Formative feedback generation in a VR-based dental surgical skill training simulator,"Su Yin, M.; Haddawy, P.; Suebnukarn, S.; Kulapichitr, F.; Rhienmora, P.; Jatuwat, V.; Uthaipattanacheep, N.","Fine motor skill is indispensable for a dentist. As in many other medical fields of study, the traditional surgical master-apprentice model is widely adopted in dental education. Recently, virtual reality (VR) simulators have been employed as supplementary components to the traditional skill-training curriculum, and numerous dental VR systems have been developed academically and commercially. However, the full promise of such systems has yet to be realized due to the lack of sufficient support for formative feedback. Without such a mechanism, evaluation still demands dedicated time of experts in scarce supply. To fill the gap of formative assessment using VR simulators in skill training in dentistry, we present a framework to objectively assess the surgical skill and generate formative feedback automatically. VR simulators enable collecting detailed data on relevant metrics throughout a procedure. Our approach to formative feedback is to correlate procedure metrics with the procedure outcome to identify the portions of a procedure that need to be improved. Specifically, for the errors in the outcome, the responsible portions of the procedure are identified by using the location of the error. Tutoring formative feedback is provided using the video modality. The effectiveness of the feedback system is evaluated with dental students using randomized controlled trials. The findings show the feedback mechanisms to be effective and to have the potential to be used as valuable supplemental training resources.

"Teaching basic trauma: validating FluoroSim, a digital fluoroscopic simulator for guide-wire insertion in hip surgery","Sugand, K.; Wescott, R. A.; Carrington, R.; Hart, A.; Van Duren, B. H.","Background and purpose - Simulation is an adjunct to surgical education. However, nothing can accurately simulate fluoroscopic procedures in orthopedic trauma. Current options for training with fluoroscopy are either intraoperative, which risks radiation, or use of expensive and unrealistic virtual reality simulators. We introduce FluoroSim, an inexpensive digital fluoroscopy simulator without the need for radiation. Patients and methods - This was a multicenter study with 26 surgeons in which everyone completed 1 attempt at inserting a guide-wire into a femoral dry bone using surgical equipment and FluoroSim. 5 objective performance metrics were recorded in real-time to assess construct validity. The surgeons were categorized based on the number of dynamic hip screws (DHS) performed: novices (< 10), intermediates (10-39) and experts (>= 40). A 7-point Likert scale questionnaire assessed the face and content validity of FluoroSim. Results - Construct validity was present for 2 clinically validated metrics in DHS surgery. Experts and intermediates statistically significantly outperformed novices for tip-apex distance and for cut-out rate. Novices took the least number of radiographs. Face and content validity were also observed. Interpretation - FluoroSim discriminated between novice and intermediate or expert surgeons based on tip-apex distance and cut-out rate while demonstrating face and content validity. FluoroSim provides a useful adjunct to orthopedic training. Our findings concur with results from studies using other simulation modalities. FluoroSim can be implemented for education easily and cheaply away from theater in a safe and controlled environment. Copyright © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Interactive teaching environment for diagnostic radiography with real-time X-ray simulation and patient positioning,"Sujar, A.; Kelly, G.; Garcia, M.; Vidal, F. P.","Purpose: Traditional undergraduate radiographer training mixes academic lectures and clinical practice. Our goal is to bridge the current disconnection between theory and practice in a safe environment, avoiding the risk of radiation for both practitioners and patients. To this end, this research proposes a new software to teach diagnostic radiography using real-time interactive X-ray simulation and patient positioning. Method(s): The proposed medical simulator is composed of three main modules. A fast and accurate character animation technique is in charge of simulating the patient positioning phase and adapts their internal anatomy accordingly. gVirtualXRay is an open-source X-ray simulation library and generates the corresponding radiographs in real time. Finally, the courseware allows going through all the diagnostic radiology steps from the patient positioning and the machine configuration to the final image enhancing. Result(s): A face and content validation study has been conducted; 18 radiology professionals were recruited to evaluate our software using a questionnaire. The results show that our tool is realistic in many ways (72% of the participants agreed that the simulations are visually realistic), useful (67%) and suitable (78%) for teaching X-ray radiography. Conclusion(s): The proposed tool allows simulating the most relevant steps of the projectional radiography procedure. The virtual patient posing system and X-ray simulation module execute at interactive rates. These features enable the lectures to show their students the results of good and bad practices in a classroom environment, avoiding radiation risk.

A virtual reality simulation-based nursing education through epistemological network model,"Sujitha, S.; Edna Sweenie, J.; Lakshmi, S. M.; Rathiga, C.; Sujana, G.","Because they provide low-risk, immersive approaches to introduce pre-licensure students to clinical contexts while also situating the development of necessary information and skills for patient care, simulations are commonly used in undergraduate nursing education. In the field of clinical education, virtual reality (VR) simulations provide fresh options. Research in this field is exploding, with topics ranging from perceptions of virtual reality as a medium to adoption of the technology to educational outcomes that virtual reality simulations may assist achieve. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of epistemic network analysis (ENA), a quantitative ethnography (QE) technique, to model how one nursing educator facilitated clinical judgement, nurtured quality and safety education for nurses' competencies, and nurtured quality and safety education for nurses' competencies through the use of the Simulation Learning System with Virtual Reality (SLS VR) (SLS with VR). Three simulation sessions in October and November 2020, all containing a basics scenario requiring second-year nursing students to exercise basic assessment and care management, were used to create a model of the discourse.

Piloting Virtual Surgical Patient Cases with 3rd-year medical students during the surgery rotation,"Sullivan, S. A.; Bingman, E.; O'Rourke, A.; Pugh, C. M.","Background Surgical education programs are increasingly challenged to make medical students' learning experiences in their surgery rotation meaningful while making the most of limited faculty resources and maximizing patient safety. Simulations and virtual environments are potential resources for providing meaningful clinical learning experiences. Methods Ninety-eight 3rd-year medical students used the Virtual Surgical Patient Cases software as a part of their surgery clerkship. We used a mixed-methods approach to data collection and analyses to investigate how students and faculty engaged with cases as teaching and learning tools. Results Students improved their clinical reasoning skills significantly at each case attempt, but made some errors consistently across attempts. Faculty used the information provided about students' decisions during the cases to guide their teaching during case discussions. Conclusions Including more cases in the surgical clerkship could allow students additional practice with making diagnoses and facilitate an interactive role in discussing cases with faculty.

Learning effectiveness of using augmented reality technology in central venous access procedure: an experiment using phantom and head-mounted display,"Suzuki, K.; Morita, S.; Endo, K.; Yamamoto, T.; Fujii, S.; Ohya, J.; Masamune, K.; Sakai, S.","Purpose: Augmented reality (AR) technology improves the learning process in interventional radiology. This study hypothesized that using AR to train for central venous access is superior to using ultrasound alone. Method(s): This study used an AR central venous catheterization phantom with an internal jugular vein (IJV) and subclavian vein (SCV) made of resin body and soft tubing. Ten radiologists attempted to punctuate, using needle placement simulation, under three conditions (ultrasound-, augmented reality-, and ultrasound and AR-guided methods; US-only, AR-only, and US+AR, respectively) using a smart-glass device (HoloLens, Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Subjective (anatomical understanding and self-confidence for procedure) and objective evaluations (optimized needle position and time) were recorded for each condition. Result(s): The subjective IJV evaluation showed no difference among the guiding methods (p = 0.26 and p = 0.07 for anatomical understanding and self-confidence for procedure, respectively). Conversely, there were significant improvements in subjective and objective evaluations for SCV using the AR-only and US+AR methods (p < 0.05) and US+AR method (p < 0.05), respectively. The AR-only method reduced the time required to fix the needle position to puncture the SCV (p < 0.05), but its objective evaluation did not improve compared with the US-only method (p = 0.20). Conclusion(s): Adding the AR-guided method to the US-guided method improved subjective and objective evaluations in the SVC procedure. The AR technology-assisted training may be more beneficial for use in difficult procedures. Though the AR-only method saved time, no time saving is expected with AR+US method.

"Comparisons of orthodontic residents' performance and attitudes using 2D, 3D, and virtual reality surgical simulation methods","Sytek, L.; Inglehart, M. R.; Ramaswamy, V.; Aronovich, S.; Edwards, S.; Kim-Berman, H.","PURPOSE: Advances in virtual reality technology for surgical simulation methods may improve diagnosis and treatment planning of complex orthognathic surgery cases. The objectives were to assess orthodontic residents' performance and attitudes when treatment planning orthognathic surgery cases using two-dimensional (2D) digital, three-dimensional (3D) digital, and virtual reality (VR) surgical simulations. METHOD(S): The study had a mixed methods study design involving 20 graduate orthodontic residents. Their previous experiences, confidence, and competence with orthodontic diagnosis and surgical treatment planning were assessed with a baseline survey. Each resident completed 2D, 3D, and VR treatment planning and simulation tasks in a randomized order and recorded their diagnosis, objectives, treatment plan, and special surgical concerns for each case using a treatment planning worksheet. The worksheets were scored and quantitative data were analyzed. Attitudinal responses to the simulation experience were captured with a post-survey and interview. RESULT(S): The number of total prescribed surgical movements was greater for 3D and VR simulation methods (p = 0.001). There were no differences in the overall total written treatment plan analysis score among the three surgical simulation tasks. Participants took longer to complete the VR and 3D tasks (p < 0.001) and asked more questions regarding manipulation (p < 0.001) and software features (p < 0.002) for higher fidelity tools. Analysis of qualitative feedback showed positive attitudes toward higher fidelity tools with regard to visualization, manipulation, and enjoyment of the task. CONCLUSION(S): The results demonstrate that simulation methods of increased fidelity (3D and VR) are appropriate alternatives to 2D conventional orthognathic surgical simulation methods when combined with traditional records. Qualitative feedback confirms residents' readiness to adopt VR simulation. However, comprehensive training is needed to increase familiarity and comfort with using the new technology.

Effect of self-learning media based on 360degree Virtual Reality for learning periodontal instrument skills,"Tak, N. Y.; Lim, H. J.; Lim, D. S.; Hwang, Y. S.; Jung, I. H.","INTRODUCTION: 360degree Virtual Reality (VR) is possibly produced and sufficiently effective as a consumer-friendly VR learning medium. Therefore, it is also expected to be useful in the dental practice field, as a self-learning medium for non-face-to-face skill training during the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19). Accordingly, this study was conducted to assess 360degree VR self-learning media for a periodontal instrument operation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 30 participants who had never experienced instrument training. We offered basic education and initial assessment (IA), then divided them into three groups: 1) PAPER: trained only with paper handouts; 2) 2D: trained with 2D video; 3) VR: trained with 360degree VR. Each group performed self-learning and mid-term assessment (MA). Subjects then implemented home self-learning with the same media for one week, which was then followed by a final assessment (FA). RESULT(S): Analysis of IA-to-FA improvement scores showed that VR and 2D video were significantly higher than the PAPER groups. Meanwhile, analysis of MA-to-FA improvement scores showed that only VR was substantially higher than the PAPER group. Although VR and 2D video groups were not considerably different, VR scores were numerically higher than 2D video in all improvement score analyses. DISCUSSION: Both 2D video and 360degree VR training were helpful to participants for an effective self-learning and also had good portability and accessibility as online-based learning methods. 360degree VR showed higher learning efficiency than regular 2D video, possibly due to its autonomy, 360degree visual information, and physical and immersive characteristics, which positively affected self-training. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings showed the potential of 360degree VR learning media and further, suggest its usefulness as a novel self-learning method in future dental education.

Design Prospective study (Canadian Task Force Class II). Setting University Hospital. Participants Four obstetrics-gynecology residents who participated in our 2-month laparoscopic training course. Interventions Virtual reality laparoscopic surgery simulator-based assessment of four basic tasks: (1) ""camera manipulation""; (2) ""eye-hand coordination""; (3) ""two-handed maneuvers""; and (4) ""cutting,"" before and after the course. Measurements and main results Mean times required to perform the tasks before and after training were compared. The mean times required to perform three of the four tasks (except camera manipulation) were significantly reduced after training. Total instrument path lengths were reduced, especially for instruments used by the dominant hand. Conclusion Use of the virtual reality laparoscopic surgery simulator allowed us to objectively assess residents' acquisition of basic laparoscopic skills. We found that residents more readily acquired dominant-hand skills during their 2-month training.

Virtual reality videos used in undergraduate palliative and oncology medical teaching: results of a pilot study,"Taubert, M.; Webber, L.; Hamilton, T.; Carr, M.; Harvey, M.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) immersive environments have been shown to be effective in medical teaching. Our university hospital received funding from our deanery, Health Education in Wales, to film teaching videos with a 360-degree camera. AIMS: To evaluate whether VR is an effective and acceptable teaching environment. VR headsets were set up for medical students who rotated through Velindre Cancer Hospital's Palliative Care department. METHOD(S): Students were asked to put on a VR headset and experience a pre-recorded 27min presentation on nausea and vomiting in palliative care settings. They subsequently viewed a radiotherapy treatment experience from a patient's point of view. RESULT(S): Of the 72 medical students who participated, 70 found the experience comfortable, with two students stating they felt the experience uncomfortable (1=headsettoo tight; 1=blurry visuals). Numerical scoring on ability to concentrate in VR from 0 to 10 (0=worst, 10=best) scored an average of 8.44 (range, 7-10). Asked whether this format suited their learning style, average score was 8.31 (range 6-10). 97.2 % (n=70) students stated that they would recommend this form of learning to a colleague, with one student saying he/she would not recommend and another stating he/she was unsure. Students left anonymous free-text feedback comments which helped frame future needs in this emerging area. DISCUSSION: This study suggests that there is room for exploring new ways of delivering teaching and expanding it more widely in palliative care and oncology, but also provides feedback on areas that need further careful attention. Comments from students included: ""Might have been the novelty factor but I learnt more from this 20min VR thing than I have from many lectures"". SUMMARY: The project has proved sufficiently popular in medical student feedback, that the VR experience is now available on YouTube and has been permanently introduced into routine teaching. Further 360-degree teaching environments have been filmed. Of note is that our 360-degree videos have been viewed in Africa, so this format of teaching could prove valuable due to its global reach.

"Virtual reality-based simulation improves gynecologic brachytherapy proficiency, engagement, and trainee self-confidence","Taunk, N. K.; Shah, N. K.; Hubley, E.; Anamalayil, S.; Trotter, J. W.; Li, T.","PURPOSE: Intracavitary brachytherapy is critical in treatment of cervical cancer with the highest rates of local control and survival. Only about 50% of graduating residents express confidence to develop a brachytherapy practice with caseload as the greatest barrier. We hypothesize that virtual reality (VR)-based intracavitary brachytherapy simulation will improve resident confidence, engagement, and proficiency. METHOD(S): We created a VR training video of an intracavitary brachytherapy case performed by a board-certified gynecologic radiation oncologist and medical physicist. Residents performed a timed intracavitary procedure on a pelvic simulator before and after viewing the VR simulation module on a commercially available VR headset while five objective measures of implant quality were recorded. The residents completed a pre- and postsimulation questionnaire assessing self-confidence, procedural knowledge, and perceived usefulness of the session. RESULT(S): There were 14 residents, including five postgraduate year (PGY)-2, three PGY-3, four PGY-4, and two PGY-5, who participated in the VR curriculum. There were improvements in resident confidence (1.43-3.36), and subjective technical skill in assembly (1.57-3.50) and insertion (1.64-3.21) after the simulation. Average time of implant decreased from 5:51 to 3:34 (p = 0.0016). Median technical proficiencies increased from 4/5 to 5/5. Overall, the residents found VR to be a useful learning tool and indicated increased willingness to perform the procedure again. CONCLUSION(S): VR intracavitary brachytherapy simulation improves residents' self-confidence, subjective and objective technical skills, and willingness to perform brachytherapy. Furthermore, VR is an immersive, engaging, time-efficient, inexpensive, and enjoyable tool that promotes residents interest in brachytherapy.

A High-Fidelity Hybrid Virtual Reality Simulator of Aneurysm Clipping Repair With Brain Sylvian Fissure Exploration for Vascular Neurosurgery Training,"Teodoro-Vite, S.; Perez-Lomeli, J. S.; Dominguez-Velasco, C. F.; Hernandez-Valencia, A. F.; Capurso-Garcia, M. A.; Padilla-Castaneda, M. A.","INTRODUCTION: Microsurgery clipping is one of the most challenging surgical interventions in neurosurgery. The opportunities to train residents are scarce, but the need for accumulating practice is mandatory. New simulating tools are needed for skill learning. METHOD(S): The design, implementation, and assessment of a new hybrid aneurysm clipping simulator are presented. It consists of an ergonomic workstation with a patient head mannequin and a physics-based virtual reality simulation with bimanual haptic feedback. The simulator recreates scenarios of microsurgery from the patient fixation and the exploration of the brain lobes through Sylvian fissure and vascular structures to the aneurysm clipping. Skill metrics were introduced, including monitoring of gestures movements, exerted forces, tissue displacements, and precision in clipping. RESULT(S): Two experimental conditions were tested: (1) simple clipping without brain tissue exploration and (2) clipping the aneurysm with brain Sylvian fissure exploration. Differences in the bimanual gestures were observed between both conditions. The quantitative measurements of tissue displacement of the brain lobes exhibited more tissue retrieval for the surgical gestures of neurosurgeons. Appraisal with questionnaires showed positive scores by neurosurgeons in all items evaluating the usability and realism of the simulator. CONCLUSION(S): The simulator was well accepted and feasible for training purposes. The analysis of the interactions with virtual tissues offers information to establish differential and common patterns between tested groups and thus useful metrics for skill evaluation of practitioners. Future work can lead to other tasks during the intervention and the inclusion of more clinical cases.

Resident simulation training in endoscopic endonasal surgery utilizing haptic feedback technology,"Thawani, J. P.; Ramayya, A. G.; Abdullah, K. G.; Hudgins, E.; Vaughan, K.; Piazza, M.; Madsen, P. J.; Buch, V.; Sean Grady, M.","Simulated practice may improve resident performance in endoscopic endonasal surgery. Using the NeuroTouch haptic simulation platform, we evaluated resident performance and assessed the effect of simulation training on performance in the operating room. First- (N = 3) and second- (N = 3) year residents were assessed using six measures of proficiency. Using a visual analog scale, the senior author scored subjects. After the first session, subjects with lower scores were provided with simulation training. A second simulation served as a task-learning control. Residents were evaluated in the operating room over six months by the senior author-who was blinded to the trained/untrained identities-using the same parameters. A nonparametric bootstrap testing method was used for the analysis (Matlab v. 2014a). Simulation training was associated with an increase in performance scores in the operating room averaged over all measures (p = 0.0045). This is the first study to evaluate the training utility of an endoscopic endonasal surgical task using a virtual reality haptic simulator. The data suggest that haptic simulation training in endoscopic neurosurgery may contribute to improvements in operative performance. Limitations include a small number of subjects and adjudication bias-although the trained/untrained identity of subjects was blinded. Further study using the proposed methods may better describe the relationship between simulated training and operative performance in endoscopic Neurosurgery.

A.; Lakshman, K.; Reddy, R.; Nale, S.; Ravishankar,","Background: We are currently in the era of laparoscopic surgery. It has gained popularity in the last few decades because of its well-known advantages. Laparoscopy requires different skills from those of open surgery. In a paradigm shift, learning basic surgical skills is now performed more in the skills laboratory than in the operation theater. However, there is a lack of reliable training and assessment tools for laparoscopic surgical skills. This study aimed to objectively assess the effect of bench laparoscopic training in novices. Method(s): This prospective study was conducted at the Clinical Skills Centre of Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI) in Bangalore, India. Sixty interns with no previous experience in laparoscopy were included. They underwent supervised training on the box trainer for 3 days, 2 hours a day, in basic surgical tasks, including pointing dots, joining straight lines, joining curved lines, picking objects, peg transfer, and circle cut. All participants were assessed objectively in a virtual reality (VR) simulator before and after training. The objective outcomes measured were time taken, distance traveled, and error scores given by the VR simulator metrics. Result(s): The novices showed statistically significant improvement in all the tasks after the training compared with their skill levels before the training. Conclusion(s): Structured short-term training significantly improves basic laparoscopic surgery skills. Copyright © 2021 Author.

Nursing students' engagement and experiences with virtual reality in an undergraduate bioscience course,"Thompson, D. S.; Thompson, A. P.; McConnell, K.","Objectives The challenges of bioscience courses such as anatomy and physiology in nursing education are well documented. Virtual reality has recently become accessible and may support student engagement. The purpose of this project was to describe students' engagement and experiences with virtual reality in a first-year nursing course on anatomy, physiology, and health assessment. Methods We used a cross-sectional design and collected both quantitative and qualitative data. The Exploratory Learning Model guided our work. Results Students perceived their engagement to be higher in virtual reality compared to other teaching methods. Their experiences were positive with students reporting that they found it easy to use, it helped their learning, and they recommended more of it. Conclusions Virtual reality is an accessible tool for supporting student engagement. The Exploratory Learning Model is a useful conceptualization for integrating virtual reality into a course. Future research on the relationship between virtual reality and learning achievements is warranted.",2020,,International journal of nursing education scholarship,17,1,,632909427,,,#5018,Thompson 2020,,
Virtual patients as a tool for training preregistration pharmacists and increasing their preparedness to practice: A qualitative study,"Thompson, J.; White, S.; Chapman, S.","Virtual patients are an active learning pedagogical tool which simulate clinical scenarios in a three-dimensional environment. Their use in pharmacy education is under-researched in comparison to other healthcare professions. In the United Kingdom, pre-registration training refers to a year of workplace based training which pharmacy graduates must complete prior to professional registration as pharmacists. This study aimed to evaluate preregistration pharmacists' perceptions on the integration, usefulness and enjoyment of completing virtual patient simulations or non-interactive case studies as part of their training. Pre-registration trainees completed three virtual patient simulations or three non-interactive case studies on the topics of: emergency hormonal contraception, renal function and childhood illnesses. Telephone interviews were conducted with twenty pre-registration pharmacists, exploring their perspectives on the use of the virtual patient or non-interactive case studies. Data was analysed using the five-stage framework approach. Four main themes emerged from the data: case study design; usefulness of the case studies as a training tool; support in pre-registration training; utility of the learning tools. Trainees also identified technical issues they had experienced while completing the virtual patient simulations, specifically with keyword recognition. Pre-registration trainees who used the virtual patients provided comments relating to the novelty, realism and enjoyment in completing them. Trainees in both groups reported developing knowledge and skills from completing the case studies; those who used the virtual patient commented on the development of communication skills and an increase in confidence for practice and those who used the non-interactive cases focused on knowledge acquisition and numeracy. Participants were enthusiastic about virtual patients as a novel training tool which provided an opportunity for learners to practice realistic scenarios in a safe environment. Virtual patients offer the potential to 'bridge the gap' in pharmacist pre-registration sector-related training variation, promote learning through reflection on doing and increase overall preparedness for practice.

Operating Room Performance Improves after Proficiency-Based Virtual Reality Cataract Surgery Training,"Thomsen, A. S. S.; Bach-Holm, D.; Kjaerbo, H.; Hojgaard-Olsen, K.; Subhi, Y.; Saleh, G. M.; Park, Y. S.; la Cour, M.; Konge, L.","Purpose To investigate the effect of virtual reality proficiency-based training on actual cataract surgery performance. The secondary purpose of the study was to define which surgeons benefit from virtual reality training. Design Multicenter masked clinical trial. Participants Eighteen cataract surgeons with different levels of experience. Methods Cataract surgical training on a virtual reality simulator (EyeSi) until a proficiency-based test was passed. Main Outcome Measures Technical performance in the operating room (OR) assessed by 3 independent, masked raters using a previously validated task-specific assessment tool for cataract surgery (Objective Structured Assessment of Cataract Surgical Skill). Three surgeries before and 3 surgeries after the virtual reality training were video-recorded, anonymized, and presented to the raters in random order. Results Novices (non-independently operating surgeons) and surgeons having performed fewer than 75 independent cataract surgeries showed significant improvements in the OR-32% and 38%, respectively-after virtual reality training (P = 0.008 and P = 0.018). More experienced cataract surgeons did not benefit from simulator training. The reliability of the assessments was high with a generalizability coefficient of 0.92 and 0.86 before and after the virtual reality training, respectively. Conclusions Clinically relevant cataract surgical skills can be improved by proficiency-based training on a virtual reality simulator. Novices as well as surgeons with an intermediate level of experience showed improvement in OR performance score.

Is there inter-procedural transfer of skills in intraocular surgery? A randomized controlled trial,"Thomsen, A. S. S.; Kiilgaard, J. F.; la Cour, M.; Brydges, R.; Konge, L.","Purpose: To investigate how experience in simulated cataract surgery impacts and transfers to the learning curves for novices in vitreoretinal surgery. Method(s): Twelve ophthalmology residents without previous experience in intraocular surgery were randomized to (1) intensive training in cataract surgery on a virtual-reality simulator until passing a test with predefined validity evidence (cataract trainees) or to (2) no cataract surgery training (novices). Possible skill transfer was assessed using a test consisting of all 11 vitreoretinal modules on the EyeSi virtual-reality simulator. All participants repeated the test of vitreoretinal surgical skills until their performance curve plateaued. Three experienced vitreoretinal surgeons also performed the test to establish validity evidence. Analysis with independent samples t-tests was performed. Result(s): The vitreoretinal test on the EyeSi simulator demonstrated evidence of validity, given statistically significant differences in mean test scores for the first repetition; experienced surgeons scored higher than novices (p = 0.023) and cataract trainees (p = 0.003). Internal consistency for the 11 modules of the test was acceptable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.73). Our findings did not indicate a transfer effect with no significant differences found between cataract trainees and novices in their starting scores (mean +/- SD 381 +/- 129 points versus 455 +/- 82 points, p = 0.262), time to reach maximum performance level (10.7 +/- 3.0 hr versus 8.7 +/- 2.8 hr, p = 0.265), or maximum scores (785 +/- 162 points versus 805 +/- 73 points, p = 0.791). Conclusion(s): Pretraining in cataract surgery did not demonstrate any measurable effect on vitreoretinal procedural performance. The results of this study indicate that we should not anticipate extensive transfer of surgical skills when planning training programmes in intraocular surgery.

High correlation between performance on a virtual-reality simulator and real-life cataract surgery,"Thomsen, A. S. S.; Smith, P.; Subhi, Y.; Cour, M. L.; Tang, L.; Saleh, G. M.; Konge, L.","Purpose: To investigate the correlation in performance of cataract surgery between a virtual-reality simulator and real-life surgery using two objective assessment tools with evidence of validity. Method(s): Cataract surgeons with varying levels of experience were included in the study. All participants performed and videorecorded three standard cataract surgeries before completing a proficiency-based test on the EyeSi virtual-reality simulator. Standard cataract surgeries were defined as: (1) surgery performed under local anaesthesia, (2) patient age >60 years, and (3) visual acuity >1/60 preoperatively. A motion-tracking score was calculated by multiplying average path length and average number of movements from the three real-life surgical videos of full procedures. The EyeSi test consisted of five abstract and two procedural modules: intracapsular navigation, antitremor training, intracapsular antitremor training, forceps training, bimanual training, capsulorhexis and phaco divide and conquer. Result(s): Eleven surgeons were enrolled. After a designated warm-up period, the proficiency-based test on the EyeSi simulator was strongly correlated to real-life performance measured by motion-tracking software of cataract surgical videos with a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.70 (p = 0.017). Conclusion(s): Performance on the EyeSi simulator is significantly and highly correlated to real-life surgical performance. However, it is recommended that performance assessments are made using multiple data sources. Copyright © 2016 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

CLASSIE teaching - using virtual reality to incorporate medical ethics into clinical decision making,"Torda, A.","BACKGROUND: Teaching medical ethics (ME) in the clinical environment is often difficult, uncalibrated and medical students get variable exposure to skilled educators. Explicit discussion of ethical dimensions of patient management is often neglected, as clinical teachers may feel inadequately skilled to do this. METHOD(S): We developed a suite of online modules. Each consisted of a clinical scenario filmed using virtual reality (VR) technology, linked to an adaptive, interactive, online tutorial which explicitly discussed the relevant ethical issues and guidelines. These were embedded in clinical placements of students to encourage the transfer of knowledge from these modules to clinical skill competency. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate these modules which examined student engagement, knowledge gains (self-perceived and measured) and user experience. We also reviewed reflections to assess the incorporation of these modules and transfer of knowledge into the clinical learning and skill development of the students. RESULT(S): Engagement and self-perceived knowledge gains were extremely high. Students found these modules realistic, interesting and helpful. The measured knowledge gains (module exit quiz) were moderate. User experience was positive overall, although students were intolerant of any technical glitches. There was mixed feedback on whether the VR aspect of the clinical scenarios added value. Student reflections showed high level incorporation of these modules into clinical practice of the students and evidence of knowledge transfer (level 3 Kirkpatrick model of evaluation) in over 3/4 of students. CONCLUSION(S): This study showed that the use VR clinical scenarios combined with interactive online learning modules resulted in demonstrable high-level student engagement and learning gains in medical ethics and transfer of knowledge to clinical application. It standardised and ensured the student experience of high-quality educational deliverables in clinical years of medical education. This use of VR and online technology can be adapted for use in many areas of the medical curricula where we need to ensure the delivery of well calibrated, high quality, educational deliverables at scale for students.",2020,23-Sep,BMC medical education,20(1),,326,632970978,,,#5057,Torda 2020,,
Preparing future health care workers for interactions with people with dementia: A mixed methods study,"Torrence, C.; Bhanu, A.; Bertrand, J.; Dye, C.; Truong, K.; Madathil, K. C.","Strategies used in training future health professionals have expanded from traditional methods to a variety of approaches, including sensitivity training. Students who receive disease-specific sensitivity training are more compassionate to patients. Alzheimer's disease (AD) sensitivity training includes deficit-focused dementia tours that physically alter sensations. This embedded-experimental (between-subjects) variant mixed-methods study assessed the effectiveness of virtual reality as a delivery format for dementia tours compared to dementia tours that physically alter sensations. It also compared the effectiveness of deficit-focused dementia sensitivity training to reading strengths-focused case studies, a traditional instruction method. Forty-one university students were randomized into one of three conditions. All participants completed pre- and post-assessments and were interviewed. Quantitative results indicate that a dementia tour offered through virtual reality is as effective as a physical-based tour; however, compared to reading case studies, participants reported poorer attitudes about living with AD and feeling less prepared for caregiving. The qualitative results show an increase in empathy across all conditions. Integration of findings indicates that dementia tours in both formats are effective at encouraging empathy and that both strengths-based and deficit-based sensitivity training are important components of education for future health care workers.",2022,8-Apr,Gerontology & geriatrics education,,,20-Jan,637721178,,,#5061,Torrence 2022,,
Comparison of two innovative strategies using augmented reality for communication in aesthetic dentistry: A pilot study,"Touati, R.; Richert, R.; Millet, C.; Farges, J. C.; Sailer, I.; Ducret, M.","During dental prosthetic rehabilitation, communication and conception are achieved using rigorous methodologies such as smile design protocols. The aim of the present pilot study was to compare two innovative strategies that used augmented reality for communication in dentistry. These strategies enable the user to instantly try a virtual smile proposition by taking a set of pictures from different points of view or by using the iPad as an enhanced mirror. Sixth-year dental students (n=18, women = 13, men = 5, mean age = 23.8) were included in this pilot study and were asked to answer a 5-question questionnaire studying the user experience using a visual analog scale (VAS). Answers were converted into a numerical result ranging from 0 to 100 for statistical analysis. Participants were not able to report a difference between the two strategies in terms of handling of the device (p=0.45), quality of the reconstruction (p=0.73), and fluidity of the software (p=0.67). Even if the participants' experience with the enhanced mirror was more often reported as immersive and more likely to be integrated in a daily dental office practice, no significant increase was reported (p=0.15 and p=0.07). Further investigations are required to evaluate time and cost savings in daily practice. Software accuracy is also a major point to investigate in order to go further in clinical applications.

Validation of virtual reality arthroscopy simulator relevance in characterising experienced surgeons,"Tronchot, A.; Berthelemy, J.; Thomazeau, H.; Huaulme, A.; Walbron, P.; Sirveaux, F.; Jannin, P.","Background: Virtual reality (VR) simulation is particularly suitable for learning arthroscopy skills. Despite significant research, one drawback often outlined is the difficulty in distinguishing performance levels (Construct Validity) in experienced surgeons. Therefore, it seems adequate to search new methods of performance measurements using probe trajectories instead of commonly used metrics. Hypothesis: It was hypothesized that a larger experience in surgical shoulder arthroscopy would be correlated with better performance on a VR shoulder arthroscopy simulator and that experienced operators would share similar probe trajectories. Material(s) and Method(s): After answering to standardized questionnaires, 104 trajectories from 52 surgeons divided into 2 cohorts (26 intermediates and 26 experts) were recorded on a shoulder arthroscopy simulator. The procedure analysed was the ""loose body removal"" in a right shoulder joint. 10 metrics were computed on the trajectories including procedure duration, overall path length, economy of motion and smoothness. Additionally, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was computed on the trajectories for unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the surgeons. Result(s): Experts were significantly faster (Median 70.9s Interquartile range [56.4-86.3] vs. 116.1s [82.8-154.2], p < 0.01), more fluid (4.6.10<sup>5</sup>mm.s<sup>-3</sup> [3.1.10<sup>5</sup>-7.2.10<sup>5</sup>] vs. 1.5.10<sup>6</sup>mm.s<sup>-3</sup> [2.6.10<sup>6</sup>-3.5.10<sup>6</sup>], p = 0.05), and economical in their motion (19.3mm<sup>2</sup> [9.1-25.9] vs. 33.8mm<sup>2</sup> [14.8-50.5], p < 0.01), but there was no significant difference in performance for path length (671.4 mm [503.8-846.1] vs 694.6 mm [467.0-1090.1], p = 0.62). The DTW clustering differentiates two expertise related groups of trajectories with performance similarities, respectively including 48 expert trajectories for the first group and 52 intermediates and 4 expert trajectories for the second group (Sensitivity of 92%, Specificity of 100%). Hierarchical clustering with DTW significantly identified expert operators from intermediate operators and found trajectory similarities among 24/26 experts. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated the Construct Validity of the VR shoulder arthroscopy simulator within groups of experienced surgeons. With new types of metrics simply based on the simulator's raw trajectories, it was possible to significantly distinguish levels of expertise. We demonstrated that clustering analysis with Dynamic Time Warping was able to reliably discriminate between expert operators and intermediate operators. Clinical Relevance: The results have implications for the future of arthroscopic surgical training or post-graduate accreditation programs using virtual reality simulation.

"Does your team know how to respond safely to an operating room fire? Outcomes of a virtual reality, AI-enhanced simulation training","Truong, H.; Qi, D.; Ryason, A.; Sullivan, A. M.; Cudmore, J.; Alfred, S.; Jones, S. B.; Parra, J. M.; De, S.; Jones, D. B.","Background: Operating room (OR) fires are rare but devastating events requiring immediate and effective response. Virtual Reality (VR) simulation training can provide a safe environment for practice of skills in such highly stressful situation. This study assessed interprofessional participants' ability to respond to VR-simulated OR fire scenarios, attitudes, numbers of attempt of the VR simulation do participants need to successfully respond to OR fires and does prior experience, confidence level, or professional role predict the number of attempts needed to demonstrate safety and pass the simulation. Method(s): 180 surgical team members volunteered to participate in this study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA. Each participant completed five VR OR simulation trials; the final two trials incorporated AI assistance. Primary outcomes were performance scores, number of attempts needed to pass, and pre- and post-survey results describing participant confidence and experiences. Differences across professional or training role were assessed using chi-square tests and analyses of variance. Differences in pass rates over time were assessed using repeated measures logistic regression. Result(s): One hundred eighty participants completed simulation testing; 170 (94.4%) completed surveys. Participants included surgeons (17.2%), anesthesiologists (10.0%), allied health professionals (41.7%), and medical trainees (31.1%). Prior to training, 45.4% of participants reported feeling moderately or very confident in their ability to respond to an OR fire. Eight participants (4.4%) responded safely on the first simulation attempt. Forty-three participants (23.9%) passed by the third attempt (VR only); an additional 97 participants (53.9%) passed within the 4-5th attempt (VR with AI assistance). Conclusion(s): Providers are unprepared to respond to OR fires. VR-based simulation training provides a practical platform for individuals to improve their knowledge and performance in the management of OR fires with a 79% pass rate in our study.

B.","Background: This study sought to determine the long-term impact of multidisciplinary simulated operating room (OR) team training. Method(s): Two-wave survey study (immediate post-training survey 2010-2017, follow-up 2018). Differences across time, specialty, and experience with adverse events were assessed using chi-square and t -tests. Result(s): Immediately after training, more than 90% of respondents found simulation scenarios realistic and reported team training would provide safer patient care. However, follow-up participants reported less enthusiasm toward training, with 58% stating they would like to take similar training again. A majority of participants (77%) experienced adverse events after training; those reporting adverse events reported more positive long-term evaluations. Conclusion(s): Simulated OR team training is initially highly valued by participants and is perceived as contributing to patient safety. Diminution of participant enthusiasm over time suggests that repeat training requirements be reconsidered, and less costly, alternative methods (such as asynchronous learning or virtual reality) should be explored.

Electronic Decision Support in the Delivery Room Using Augmented Reality to Improve Newborn Life Support Guideline Adherence: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study,"Tsang, K. D.; Ottow, M. K.; van Heijst, A. F. J.; Antonius, T. A. J.","INTRODUCTION: The Newborn Life Support (NLS) guideline aims to provide healthcare professionals a consistent approach during neonatal resuscitation. Adherence to this and analogous guidelines has repetitively been proven to be difficult.This study evaluates adherence to guideline using a novel augmented reality (Microsoft HoloLens) electronic decision support tool during standardized simulated neonatal resuscitation compared with subjects working from memory alone. METHOD(S): In this randomized controlled pilot study, 18 professionals responsible for neonatal resuscitation were randomized to the intervention group and 11 to the control group. Demographic characteristics were similar between both groups. A standardized neonatal resuscitation scenario was performed, which was recorded and later assessed for adherence to the NLS algorithm by 2 independent reviewers. Secondary outcomes were error classification in case of algorithm deviation and time to the execution or completion of critical steps in the algorithm to determine delay. RESULT(S): Median (interquartile range) scores of a theoretical maximum of 40 in the intervention group were 34 (32.5-35.5) versus 29 (27-33) in the control group (P = 0.004). Errors of commission were committed less frequently with the electronic decision support tool 2 (1-2.5) compared with 4 (2-4) in the control group (P = 0.029). Analysis of time to initiation or completion of key steps in the NLS algorithm showed no significant differences between both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Healthcare professionals using an electronic decision support tool showed improved adherence to the NLS guideline during simulated neonatal resuscitation.

Improving knowledge and behavior of leadership and followership among the interprofessional team,"Tschannen, D.; Dorn, R.; Tedesco, C.","Objectives: To examine virtual training on Crew Resource Management (CRM) principles of effective leadership and followership on participants' knowledge, applicability, and intended behaviors. Method(s): Graduate students (n=41) from four health disciplines participated in the training, which included a self-learning module (e.g., didactic content and video vignettes) and an optional virtual simulation exercise. Knowledge was examined via a 10-item pre/post knowledge test. Applicability of the training and intended behaviors was measured post-training via an 11-item survey. T-test and Analysis of variance were applied to compare knowledge scores, as well as to determine variation in discipline responses. Result(s): Knowledge improved significantly post-training (t(40)=10.47, p<0.001). Pharmacy students scored significantly lower on the post-knowledge test than medicine and nursing students [F(2,36)=5.99, p=0.006]. On average, participants completing the module reported learning new skills and knowledge (M=4.17, SD=0.54) and intended to use skills/knowledge gained from the training in clinical practice (M=4.29, SD=0.56). No differences were noted among responses from the various disciplines. Those completing the simulation exercise (n=10) found value in the experience, again noting strong application to practice (M=4.9, SD=0.32) and intended use in practice (M=4.9, SD=0.32).

Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays in Medical Education-A Systematic Review,"Turso-Finnich, T.; Jensen, R. O.; Jensen, L. X.; Konge, L.; Thinggaard, E.","SUMMARY STATEMENT: Simulation-based training using virtual reality head-mounted displays (VR-HMD) is increasingly being used within the field of medical education. This article systematically reviews and appraises the quality of the literature on the use of VR-HMDs in medical education. A search in the databases PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO was carried out. Studies were screened according to predefined exclusion criteria, and quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. In total, 41 articles were included and thematically divided into 5 groups: anatomy, procedural skills, surgical procedures, communication skills, and clinical decision making. Participants highly appreciated using VR-HMD and rated it better than most other training methods. Virtual reality head-mounted display outperformed traditional methods of learning surgical procedures. Although VR-HMD showed promising results when learning anatomy, it was not considered better than other available study materials. No conclusive findings could be synthesized regarding the remaining 3 groups.

Design Randomised controlled trial with 6-month follow-up (2018-2020). Setting Secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities. Participants 274 nurses and midwives assigned to labour and delivery, operating room and newborn care units were recruited from 20 healthcare facilities in Nigeria and Kenya and randomised to one of three groups: VR (eHBB+digital guide), video (video+digital guide) or control (digital guide only) groups before an in-person HBB course. Intervention(s) eHBB VR simulation or neonatal resuscitation video. Main outcome(s) Healthcare worker neonatal resuscitation skills using standardised checklists in a simulated setting at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Results Neonatal resuscitation skills pass rates were similar among the groups at 6-month follow-up for bag-and-mask ventilation (BMV) skills check (VR 28%, video 25%, control 22%, p=0.71), objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) A (VR 76%, video 76%, control 72%, p=0.78) and OSCE B (VR 62%, video 60%, control 49%, p=0.18). Relative to the immediate postcourse assessments, there was greater retention of BMV skills at 6 months in the VR group (-15% VR, p=0.10; -21% video, p<0.01, -27% control, p=0.001). OSCE B pass rates in the VR group were numerically higher at 3 months (+4%, p=0.64) and 6 months (+3%, p=0.74) and lower in the video (-21% at 3 months, p<0.001; -14% at 6 months, p=0.066) and control groups (-7% at 3 months, p=0.43; -14% at 6 months, p=0.10). On follow-up survey, 95% (n=65) of respondents in the VR group and 98% (n=82) in the video group would use their assigned intervention again. Conclusion eHBB VR training was highly acceptable to healthcare workers in low-income to middle-income countries and may provide additional support for neonatal resuscitation skills retention compared with other digital interventions.

Elements of virtual temporal bone surgery: Manipulandum format may be more important to surgeons than haptic device force capabilities,"Unger, B.; Sepehri, N.; Rampersad, V.; Pisa, J.; Michael, G.; Hochman, J. B.","Background: Temporal bone simulations are critiqued for poor drill-bone interaction. This project appraises the import of increasing haptic device and manipulandum fidelity on the perceived realism of drilling a virtual temporal bone. Virtual surgical contact forces rely on haptic device fidelity and are transmitted through a manipulandum. With identical software, both device hardware and manipulandum may each contribute to realism. We compare the three degrees of freedom (DOF), 3N Geomagic Touch (3D Systems, SC) to a 6DOF, 5.5N HD<sup>2</sup> (Quanser, ON) with the both standard (""HD<sup>2</sup>-Standard"") and in-house customized otic drill manipulandum (""HD<sup>2</sup>-Modified""). Method(s): Six otologic surgeons performed three virtual mastoidectomy surgeries on a temporal bone surgical simulator. The HD<sup>2</sup> manipulandum was modified for attached otic drill with gravity compensation and requisite mechanical modifications. Surgeons, in random order, performed the dissection with the different hardware platforms. Result(s): Two-tailed t-tests demonstrate that for the acoustic properties of each simulation, the HD<sup>2</sup>-Modified manipulandum was favored (p <= 0.0004). For overall similarity of bone, both HD<sup>2</sup>-Standard (p <= 0.05) HD<sup>2</sup>-Modified (p <= 0.03)) were favored over the Geomagic; however they were not appreciably different when directly compared to each other. There was no preference for increasing haptic device fidelity in virtual drill bone interaction. In forced rank, users favored the HD<sup>2</sup>-Modified in osseus, vibrational and overall realism, as well as being preferred for education and preoperative rehearsal (p <= 0.0164). Conclusion(s): Increasing manipulandum realism was favored. However surprisingly, there was no preference for increased device fidelity, illustrating incremental stiffness had nominal impact. There may be a ceiling to drill bone interaction in virtual haptic simulation. Level of Evidence: 2b.

Assessing acceptance of augmented reality in nursing education,"Uymaz, P.; Uymaz, A. O.","The Covid-19 pandemic has negatively affected every aspect of human life. In these challenging times nursing students, facing academic and psychological issues, are advised to use augmented reality applications in the field of health sciences for increasing their motivations and academic performances. The main motive of the study was to examine the acceptance status of nursing students in implementing augmented reality technology in their education and training. The study is a quantitative research study, and it uses the causal-comparative screening method. The data used in the study was collected online from 419 nursing students. The hybrid method was preferred. First, the hypotheses based on the linear relationships were defined between the variables which were then tested by the method of structural equation modeling. Second, the method of artificial neural networks was used to determine the non-linear relationships between the variables. The results show that the nursing students have a high intention of using augmented reality technology as a way of self-learning. It was also found that the most emphasized motive behind this intention is the expectation that using augmented reality technology will increase their academic performance. They also think that AR technology has many potential benefits to offer in the future. It was observed that a considerable number of students already use augmented reality technology for its usefulness and with a hedonic motivation. In conclusion, nursing students have a high acceptance of using augmented reality technology during their education and training process. Since we live in a world where e-learning and self-learning education/training have become widespread, it is estimated that students will demand augmented reality applications as a part of holistic education, and as an alternative to traditional textbooks.

Active vs passive haptic feedback technology in virtual reality arthroscopy simulation: Which is most realistic?,"Vaghela, K. R.; Trockels, A.; Carobene, M.","Background: Virtual Reality (VR) simulators are playing an increasingly prominent role in orthopaedic training and education. Face-validity - the degree to which reality is accurately represented - underpins the value of a VR simulator as a learning tool for trainees. Despite the importance of tactile feedback in arthroscopy, there is a paucity for evidence regarding the role of haptics in VR arthroscopy simulator realism. Purpose(s): To assess the difference in face validity between two high fidelity VR simulators employing passive and active haptic feedback technology respectively. Method(s): 38 participants were recruited and divided into intermediate and expert groups based on orthopaedic training grade. Each participant completed a 12-point diagnostic knee arthroscopy VR module using the active haptic Simbionix ARTHRO Mentor and passive haptic VirtaMed ArthroS simulators. Subsequently, each participant completed a validated simulator face validity questionnaire. Result(s): The ARTHRO Mentor active haptic system failed to achieve face validity with mean scores for external appearance (6.61), intra-articular appearance (4.78) and instrumentation (4.36) falling below the acceptable threshold (>=7.0). The ArthroS passive haptic simulator demonstrated satisfactory scores in all domains: external appearance (8.42), intra-articular appearance (7.65), instrumentation (7.21) and was significantly (p < 0.001) more realistic than ARTHRO Mentor for all metrics. 61% of participants gave scores >=7.0 for questions pertaining to haptic feedback realism from intra-articular structures such as menisci and ACL/PCL for the ArthroS vs. 12% for ARTHRO Mentor. There was no difference in face-validity perception between intermediate and expert groups for either simulator (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Current active haptic technology which employs motors to simulate tactile feedback fails to demonstrate sufficient face-validity or match the sophistication of passive haptic systems in high fidelity arthroscopy simulators. Textured rubber phantoms that mirror the anatomy and haptic properties of the knee joint provide a significantly more realistic training experience for both intermediate and expert arthroscopists.

Is the Virtual Reality Fundamentals of Arthroscopic Surgery Training Program a Valid Platform for Resident Arthroscopy Training?,"Vaghela, K. R.; Trockels, A.; Lee, J.; Akhtar, K.","BackgroundTraining in arthroscopy is associated with a steep learning curve for trainees and bears risks for patients. Virtual reality (VR) arthroscopy simulation platforms seek to overcome this and to provide a safe environment for surgical learners. The Fundamentals of Arthroscopic Surgery Training (FAST) program is one such platform. It is currently not known whether the VR FAST program can be employed as a useful teaching or examination tool to assess the basic arthroscopic skills of surgical trainees.Questions/purposes(1) Does the VR FAST program differentiate among novice, intermediate, and expert arthroscopists? (2) Does ambidextrous performance in the VR FAST program correlate with arthroscopic experience?MethodsWe prospectively recruited orthopaedic interns (novices), residents (intermediates), and fellows and attendings (experts) to complete the VR FAST program over a 1-year period from four major orthopaedic training programs on a voluntary basis. Sixty-six of 156 invited orthopaedic surgeons participated: 26 of 50 novices (16 men and 10 women), 27 of 65 intermediates (20 men and seven women), and 13 of 41 experts (10 men and three women). Surgeons of any arthroscopic experience were included, with only those with prior experience on the VR FAST program being excluded. The program consists of eight modules: three basic camera modules (Image Centering, Horizon Control, and Telescoping), three advanced camera modules (Periscoping, Trace the Line, and Trace the Curve), and two instrumented bimanual-dexterity modules (Probe Triangulation and Gather the Stars). Time taken to complete each task and measures of economy of movement (camera and instrument path length, camera alignment) were used as measures of arthroscopic experience. Every participant completed the modules using their dominant and nondominant hands. Equality in proficiency in completing the tasks using the dominant and nondominant hands were determined to be measures of arthroscopic experience. Due to the large number of outcome variables, only p values < 0.01 were considered to be statistically significant.ResultsSix of eight VR FAST modules did not discriminate among novice, intermediate, and expert arthroscopy participants. However, two did, and the ones that were most effective at distinguishing participants by level of experience were the Periscoping and Gather the Stars modules. For the Periscoping module using the dominant hand, novices required longer to complete the task with a median time of 231 seconds (IQR 149 to 358) and longer camera path length median of 191 cm (IQR 128 to 273) compared with intermediates who needed 127 seconds (IQR 106 to 233) and 125 cm (IQR 92 to 159) and experts who needed 121 seconds (IQR 93 to 157) and 119 cm (IQR 90 to 134) (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). When using the nondominant hand, novices took longer to complete the task with a median time of 231 seconds (IQR 170 to 350) and longer camera path length 204 cm (IQR 169 to 273) compared with intermediates who required 132 seconds (IQR 97 to 162) and 111 cm (IQR 88 to 143) and experts who needed 119 seconds (IQR 104 to 183) and 120 cm (IQR 108 to 166) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). For the Gather the Stars module using the nondominant hand, only the novices needed longer to complete the task at a median of 131 seconds (IQR 112 to 157) and needed a longer grasper path length of 290 cm (IQR 254 to 332) compared with intermediates who needed 84 seconds (IQR 72 to 119) and 232 cm (IQR 195 to 254) and experts who needed 98 seconds (IQR 87 to 107) and 244 cm (IQR 215 to 287) (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively).ConclusionSix of eight VR FAST modules did not demonstrate construct validity, and we found no correlation between arthroscopic experience and ambidextrous performance. Two modules demonstrated construct validity; however, refinement and expansion of the modules is needed with further validation in large prospective trials so that pass-fail thresholds can be set for use in high-stakes examinations.Clinical RelevanceMost VR FAST modu es were not discriminatory; however, they can form essential conceptual and procedural building blocks in an arthroscopic curriculum that are beneficial for novices when developing key psychomotor skills. In their present format, however, they are unsuitable for assessing arthroscopic proficiency. Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

[French],"Valentin, L.; Rabischong, B.; Compan, C.; Botchorichvili, R.; Pereira, B.; Avan, P.","Objectives.-The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of complex tasks onvirtual reality simulator (VRS) for novice surgeons in laparoscopy learning.Materials and methods.-Fifty-five medical students were prospectively randomized in twogroups (A: basic skills, n = 28 and B: basic and complex skills, n = 27) and then trained duringtwo sessions on VRS. Evaluations took place before and after each training. These evaluationsconsisted of the achievement of an intracorporeal suture, recorded on video, with the left thenwith the right hand. Two independent experts evaluated those gestures blindly.Results.-A significant progression in terms of times and technical scores was observed in bothgroups between the first and the last evaluations (P between 0.001 and 0.04). Students in groupB improved slower and longer than those in group A. However, left and right hands resultsconfused did not highlight significant differences between the two groups. At the third session,the first hand to train is significantly faster in group B than in group A (P = 0.04).Conclusion.-This study found only a late and minimal impact of complex skills to reduce theexecution time of intracorporeal suture. It also showed an slower and longer overall progressionfor those who use them compared to subjects using basic skills only.

Bimanual Fundamentals: Validation of a New Curriculum for Virtual Reality Training of Laparoscopic Skills,"van Ginkel, M. P. H.; Schijven, M. P.; van Grevenstein, W. M. U.; Schreuder, H. W. R.","Background. To determine face and construct validity for the new Bimanual Fundamentals curriculum for the Simendo<sup></sup> Virtual Reality Laparoscopy Simulator and prove its efficiency as a training and objective assessment tool for surgical resident's advanced psychomotor skills. Methods. 49 participants were recruited: 17 medical students (novices), 15 residents (intermediates), and 17 medical specialists (experts) in the field of gynecology, general surgery, and urology in 3 tertiary medical centers in the Netherlands. All participants performed the 5 exercises of the curriculum for 3 consecutive times on the simulator. Intermediates and experts filled in a questionnaire afterward, regarding the reality of the simulator and training goals of each exercise. Statistical analysis of performance was performed between novices, intermediates, and experts. Parameters such as task time, collisions/displacements, and path length right and left were compared between groups. Additionally, a total performance score was calculated for each participant. Results. Face validity scores regarding realism and training goals were overall positive (median scores of 4 on a 5-point Likert scale). Participants felt that the curriculum was a useful addition to the previous curricula and the used simulator would fit in their residency programs. Construct validity results showed significant differences on the great majority of measured parameters between groups. The simulator is able to differentiate between performers with different levels of laparoscopic experience. Conclusions. Face and construct validity for the new Bimanual Fundamental curriculum for the Simendo virtual reality simulator could be established. The curriculum is suitable to use in resident's training programs to improve and maintain advanced psychomotor skills.

Viability of Virtual Skills-based Assessments Focused on Communication,"VanLangen, K. M.; Sahr, M. J.; Salvati, L. A.; Meny, L. M.; Bright, D. R.; Sohn, M.","Objective To evaluate faculty and student perceptions of and performance on virtual skills-based assessments focused on communication compared to in-person assessments.Methods In spring 2020, virtual skills-based assessments were conducted. After all assessments were completed, two 12-item questionnaires, one for students and one for the faculty members who conducted the assessment, were designed to assess perceptions of virtual skills-based assessments. The surveys were distributed via an online platform to second- and third-year (P2 and P3) pharmacy students and to faculty who had participated in a virtual skills-based assessment. Scores from the spring 2020 virtual skills-based assessment were compared to scores on the in-person skills-based assessment that took place in spring 2019.Results Of the 19 faculty and 279 students invited to participate, 18 (94.7%) faculty and 241 (86.4%) students responded. The majority of faculty (88.9%) and students (63.5%) perceived the virtual skills-based assessments to be effective at simulating an interaction. However, only 33.3% of faculty and 28.6% of students preferred the virtual environment. There was not a significant difference in student performance between in-person and virtual assessments for patient consultation and SOAP note skills.Conclusion Providing sufficient formative and summative feedback to pharmacy students is a challenge, particularly in the context of skills-based assessments. Students and faculty reported that the virtual assessment provided an opportunity for an appropriate assessment of student communication skills. However, a strong preference for using virtual skills-based assessments in the future was not observed.

Lack of transfer of skills after virtual reality simulator training with haptic feedback,"Vapenstad, C.; Hofstad, E. F.; Bo, L. E.; Kuhry, E.; Johnsen, G.; Marvik, R.; Lango, T.; Hernes, T. N.","Background and objective: Virtual reality (VR) simulators enrich surgical training and offer training possibilities outside of the operating room (OR). In this study, we created a criterion-based training program on a VR simulator with haptic feedback and tested it by comparing the performances of a simulator group against a control group. Material(s) and Method(s): Medical students with no experience in laparoscopy were randomly assigned to a simulator group or a control group. In the simulator group, the candidates trained until they reached predefined criteria on the LapSim<sup></sup> VR simulator (Surgical Science AB, Goteborg, Sweden) with haptic feedback (Xitact<sup>TM</sup> IHP, Mentice AB, Goteborg, Sweden). All candidates performed a cholecystectomy on a porcine organ model in a box trainer (the clinical setting). The performances were video rated by two surgeons blinded to subject training status. Result(s): In total, 30 students performed the cholecystectomy and had their videos rated (N = 16 simulator group, N = 14 control group). The control group achieved better video rating scores than the simulator group (p <.05). Conclusion(s): The criterion-based training program did not transfer skills to the clinical setting. Poor mechanical performance of the simulated haptic feedback is believed to have resulted in a negative training effect.

Design Randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). Setting Academic medical center. Patients Thirty-five medical students without robotic surgical experience. Interventions Participants were enrolled in an online session of training modules followed by an in-person orientation. Baseline performance testing on the Mimic Technologies da Vinci Surgical Simulator (dVSS) was also performed. Participants were then randomly assigned to the completion of 4 dVSS training tasks (camera clutching 1, suture sponge 1 and 2, and tubes) versus no further training. The intervention group performed each dVSS task until proficiency or up to 10 times. A final suturing task was performed on a live porcine model, which was video recorded and blindly assessed by experienced surgeons. The primary outcomes were Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) scores and task time. The study had 90% power to detect a mean difference of 3 points on the GEARS scale, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 2.65, and 80% power to detect a mean difference of 3 minutes, assuming an SD of 3 minutes. Measurements and Main Results There were no differences in demographics and baseline skills between the 2 groups. No significant differences in task time in minutes or GEARS scores were seen for the final suturing task between the intervention and control groups, respectively (9.2 [2.65] vs 9.9 [2.07] minutes, p = .406; and 15.37 [2.51] vs 15.25 [3.38], p = .603).

Comparison of laparoscopic surgical skills acquired on a virtual reality simulator and a box trainer: an analysis for obstetrics-gynecology residents,"Varras, M.; Loukas, C.; Nikiteas, N.; Varra, V. K.; Varra, F. N.; Georgiou, E.","Background/Aims: It is well known that laparoscopic surgery requires the demonstration of a different set of technical skills when compared to open surgery. Laparoscopic training using simulators has been shown to accelerate learning in an efficient and standardized manner. Significant research has been conducted for skills acquisition in abdominal surgery, but in the field of gynecologic laparoscopy the relevant studies are limited. The aim of this study was to compare the training efficacy of virtual reality (VR) simulators and box-trainers (BTs) for skills acquisition in gynecologic surgery, and also to study the transferability of these skills in the performance of more advanced gynecologic operations. Method(s): Twenty residents in obstetrics-gynecology with minimal laparoscopic experience were randomized into two equal groups to be trained on either a VR simulator (Group-A) or a BT (Group-B). Group-A was trained on basic tasks (clipping, peg transfer, and cutting), whereas Group-B was trained on ovarian cystectomy and salpingotomy using custom training models. After training, the two groups were assessed on the performance of two laparoscopic gynecologic procedures on a VR simulator (salpingotomy and salpingectomy). Performance metrics included time, instrument pathlength, and various task-specific errors. Result(s): Both groups demonstrated significant performance improvement in all training tasks, for all but one of the metrics (p < 0.05). After training, both groups had improved performance in the laparoscopic operations using the VR simulator, but this trend was not statistically significant in any metric considered (p > 0.05). Similarly, the post-training performance between the two groups was not statistically different (p > 0.05).

R.; Sadanand, V.; Muniyandi, M.","Background: Training surgeons to use surgical robots are becoming part of surgical training curricula. We propose a novel method of training fine-motor skills such as Microscopic Selection Task (MST) for robot-assisted surgery using virtual reality (VR) with objective quantification of performance. We also introduce vibrotactile feedback (VTFB) to study its impact on training performance. Method(s): We use a VR-based environment to perform MST with varying degrees of difficulties. Using a well-known human-computer interaction paradigm and incorporating VTFB, we quantify the performance: speed, precision and accuracy. Result(s): MST with VTFB showed statistically significant improvement in performance metrics leading to faster completion of MST with higher precision and accuracy compared to that without VTFB.

H.; Grauslund, J.","Purpose: To test the validity of the eyesi surgical simulator as an assessment tool in a virtual reality vitreoretinal training programme. Method(s): In collaboration with an experienced vitreoretinal surgeon, a virtual vitreoretinal training programme was composed on the eyesi surgical simulator, software version 2.9.2 (VRmagic GmbH, Manheim, Germany). It was completed twice by three groups: 20 medical students, ten residents of ophthalmology and five trained vitreoretinal surgeons. The programme contained six training modules: navigation level 2 (Nav2), forceps training level 5 (ForT5), bimanual training level 3 (BimT3), laser coagulation level 3 (LasC3), posterior hyaloid level 3 (PostH3) and internal limiting membrane peeling level 3 (ILMP3). The scores in each module were assessed from two to five different factors (tissue treatment, efficiency, target achievement, instrument handling and microscope handling), and it was possible to achieve 100 points in each module. Result(s): At the final training session, the highest overall median score was found for the vitreoretinal surgeons (vitreoretinal surgeons: 434 points, residents: 394.5 points, medical students: 272.5 points, p < 0.01). This was also found in four of the six modules. These were Nav2 (p = 0.03), BimT3 (p < 0.01), PostH3 (p < 0.01) and ILMP3 (p < 0.01). On the other hand, the three groups did not differ regarding ForT5 (p = 0.16) or LasC3 (p = 0.75). Conclusion(s): We developed a training programme with validity for the eyesi surgical simulator as an assessment tool for overall score and for four of six vitreoretinal modules.

Virtual gaming simulation of a mental health assessment: A usability study,"Verkuyl, M.; Romaniuk, D.; Mastrilli, P.","Providing safe and realistic virtual simulations could be an effective way to facilitate the transition from the classroom to clinical practice. As nursing programs begin to include virtual simulations as a learning strategy; it is critical to first assess the technology for ease of use and usefulness. A virtual gaming simulation was developed, and a usability study was conducted to assess its ease of use and usefulness for students and faculty. The Technology Acceptance Model provided the framework for the study, which included expert review and testing by nursing faculty and nursing students. This study highlighted the importance of assessing ease of use and usefulness in a virtual game simulation and provided feedback for the development of an effective virtual gaming simulation. The study participants said the virtual gaming simulation was engaging, realistic and similar to a clinical experience. Participants found the game easy to use and useful. Testing provided the development team with ideas to improve the user interface. The usability methodology provided is a replicable approach to testing virtual experiences before a research study or before implementing virtual experiences into curriculum.

Cognitive Training for Robotic Arm-Assisted Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty through a Surgical Simulation Mobile Application,"Vestermark, G. L.; Bhowmik-Stoker, M.; Springer, B. D.","Advances in mobile device technology combined with the implementation of surgical simulation have led to the development of novel applications (apps) as a potential learning tool for surgical trainees. Touch Surgery (TS) (Kinosis Limited, London, United Kingdom) is a mobile-based app that combines cognitive task analysis with a virtual reality medium to familiarize the user with a surgical procedure through interactive rehearsal. The purpose of this study was to compare the educational efficacy of the TS app with a traditional paper-based learning program in performing a robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Twelve participants (four interns, four residents, four adult reconstructive fellows) were randomized to a paper-based technique guide or learning modules from the Mako Partial Knee (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ) TS app. Trainees were subjected to a baseline pretest. After preparing with the allocated training tool, participants completed an immediate posttest followed by a retention test administered 3 weeks later. The TS simulation group demonstrated greater improvement (22% score increase; p = 0.001) in posttest assessment compared with the control group (10% score increase; p = 0. 09). The TS simulation group demonstrated better information recall compared with the control group based on the score differential following the 3-week retention test. This randomized comparative study demonstrated that the TS app was better than traditional paper-based learning for both immediate posttest performance and long-term information recall of the Mako robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Surgical simulation apps may be an effective learning tool for surgical trainees. Copyright © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Use of virtual reality equipment to assess the manual dexterity of applicants for ophthalmology residency,"Vieira, I. V.; Sakaya, B. N.; Soares, L. V. B.; Chamon, W.","PURPOSE: To assess the microsurgery dexterity outcomes of two sequential training evaluations using virtual reality technology. METHOD(S): This was a multicenter cross-sectional study of all candidates who were accepted as first-year residents at one of six ophthalmology teaching institutions. Residents were subjected to two identical series of standardized, reproducible dexterity tests using virtual reality equipment (Eyesi): ""sequence 1"" and ""sequence 2."" Each sequence consisted of five difficulty levels that were assessed using a proprietary scoring system. The data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The differences between tests in sequences 1 and 2 were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULT(S): The data did not follow a normal distribution. There were improvements from sequence 1 in all the tests (all p values<0.05). The sum of all scores (total score) improved from sequence 1 (median= 152.50) to sequence 2 (median 256.00; p<0.001). There was no correlation between the delta sequence values and the average scores. CONCLUSION(S): Two sequential training evaluations using virtual reality technology showed relevant improvement in quantifications of microsurgery dexterity.

Augmented Reality to Improve Surgical Simulation: Lessons Learned Towards the Design of a Hybrid Laparoscopic Simulator for Cholecystectomy,"Viglialoro, R. M.; Esposito, N.; Condino, S.; Cutolo, F.; Guadagni, S.; Gesi, M.; Ferrari, M.; Ferrari, V.","Hybrid surgical simulators based on augmented reality (AR) solutions benefit from the advantages of both the box trainers and the virtual reality simulators. This paper reports on the results of a long development stage of a hybrid simulator for laparoscopic cholecystectomy that integrates real and the virtual components. We first outline the specifications of the AR simulator and then we explain the strategy adopted for implementing it based on a careful selection of its simulated anatomical components, and characterized by a real-time tracking of both a target anatomy and of the laparoscope. The former is tracked by means of an electromagnetic field generator, while the latter requires an additional camera for video tracking. The new system was evaluated in terms of AR visualization accuracy, realism, and hardware robustness. Obtained results show that the accuracy of AR visualization is adequate for training purposes. The qualitative evaluation confirms the robustness and the realism of the simulator. In conclusion, the proposed AR simulator satisfies all the initial specifications in terms of anatomical appearance, modularity, reusability, minimization of spare parts cost, and ability to record surgical errors and to track in real-time the Calot's triangle and the laparoscope. Thus, the proposed system could be an effective training tool for learning the task of identification and isolation of Calot's triangle in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Moreover, the presented strategy could be applied to simulate other surgical procedures involving the task of identification and isolation of generic tubular structures, such as blood vessels, biliary tree, and nerves, which are not directly visible.

Contribution of Haptic Simulation to Analogic Training Environment in Restorative Dentistry,"Vincent, M.; Joseph, D.; Amory, C.; Paoli, N.; Ambrosini, P.; Mortier, E.; Tran, N.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of virtual reality to the conventional analogic training environment and show the complementarity of conventional techniques and virtual reality in the learning of dental students. All 88 first-year dental students at a dental school in France in early 2019 were randomly assigned to one of two groups: group 1 (n = 45) was assigned to cavity preparations on a haptic simulator (Virteasy) and group 2 (n = 43) was assigned to conventional practical work on plastic analogue teeth (Kavo). Following three training sessions, the students in group 1 took a final exam on the same plastic analogue teeth exercise. The results showed improvement in the drilling skill of both groups. The simulator-trained group (group 1) had similar results to the plastic analogue-trained group (group 2) in the final test on a plastic analogue tooth. In this study, virtual reality allowed an assessment based on objective criteria and reduced the subjectivity of evaluations conducted on plastic analogue teeth. Considering the saving of supervision and teaching time as well as the material gain offered by virtual reality, the learning methods of haptic simulators are educational options that should be considered by dental educators.

Does Simulation-Based Training Improve Procedural Skills of Beginners in Interventional Cardiology? - A Stratified Randomized Study,"Voelker, W.; Petri, N.; Tonissen, C.; Stork, S.; Birkemeyer, R.; Kaiser, E.; Oberhoff, M.","Objective: To assess whether mentored simulation-based-training can improve the procedural skills of beginners in coronary interventional procedures. Background Simulation based-catheter training is a valuable tool to practice interventional procedures. Whether this type of training enhances the procedural skills of fellows learning percutaneous coronary interventions has never been studied. Method(s): Eighteen cardiology fellows were randomized either into the simulation-based training (n = 9) or the control group (n = 9). The simulation group received 7.5 hours of virtual reality (VR) simulation training, whereas the control group attended 4.5 hours of lectures. Each participant had to perform a simple (pre-evaluation) and a more complex (post-evaluation) catheter intervention on a pulsatile coronary flow model in a catheterization laboratory. All procedures were videotaped, analyzed, and rated by 3 expert interventionalists, who were blinded to the randomization. To assess the individual performance level, a ""skills score"" was determined, comprising 14 performance characteristics (5-level Likert scale, maximum score of 70 points). Result(s): The ""skills score"" increased by 5.8 +/- 6.1 points in the VR simulation group and decreased by 6.7 +/- 8.4 in the control group (P = 0.003) from the simple stenosis at pre- to the more complex lesion at post-evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of simulation-based training. Conclusion(s): This pilot study suggests that curriculum-based mentored VR simulation training improves the performance level of cardiology fellows in coronary interventions.

Using virtual reality in lumbar puncture training improves students learning experience,"Vrillon, A.; Gonzales-Marabal, L.; Ceccaldi, P. F.; Plaisance, P.; Desrentes, E.; Paquet, C.; Dumurgier, J.","BACKGROUND: Lumbar puncture (LP) is a commonly performed medical procedure in a wide range of indications. Virtual reality (VR) provides a stimulating, safe and efficient learning environment. We report the design and the evaluation of a three dimensions (3D) video for LP training. METHOD(S): We recorded a stereoscopic 180-degrees 3D video from two LPs performed in clinical settings in Fernand Widal Lariboisiere University Hospital, Paris, France. The video was administered to third-year medical students as well as to a residents and attendings group during LP simulation-based training sessions. RESULT(S): On 168 participants (108 novice third-year medical students, and 60 residents and attendings with prior LP experience), satisfaction after video exposure was high (rated 4.7+/-0.6 on a 5-point scale). No significant discomfort was reported (comfort score graded 4.5+/-0.8 on 5). LP-naive students displayed higher satisfaction and perceived benefit than users with prior LP experience (overall, P<0.05). Trainees evaluated favorably the 3D feature and supported the development of similar tutorials for other medical procedures (respectively, 3.9+/-1.1 and 4.4+/-0.9 on 5).

Saving robots improves laparoscopic performance: transfer of skills from a serious game to a virtual reality simulator,"I. Jgosse W.M; van Goor, H.; Luursema, J. M.","Background: Residents find it hard to commit to structural laparoscopic skills training. Serious gaming has been proposed as a solution on the premise that it is effective and more motivating than traditional simulation. We establish construct validity for the laparoscopic serious game Underground by comparing laparoscopic simulator performance for a control group and an Underground training group. Method(s): A four-session laparoscopic basic skills course is part of the medical master students surgical internship at the Radboud University Medical Centre. Four cohorts, representing 107 participants, were assigned to either the Underground group or the control group. The control group trained on the FLS video trainer and the LapSim virtual reality simulator for four sessions. The Underground group played Underground for three sessions followed by a transfer session on the FLS video trainer and the LapSim. To assess the effect of engaging in serious gameplay on performance on two validated laparoscopic simulators, initial performance on the FLS video trainer and the LapSim was compared between the control group (first session) and the Underground group (fourth session). Result(s): We chose task duration as a proxy for laparoscopic performance. The Underground group outperformed the control group on all three LapSim tasks: Camera navigation F(1) = 12.71, p <.01; Instrument navigation F(1) = 8.04, p <.01; and Coordination F(1) = 6.36, p =.01. There was no significant effect of playing Underground for performance on the FLS video trainer Peg Transfer task, F(1) = 0.28, p =.60. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated skills transfer between a serious game and validated laparoscopic simulator technology. Serious gaming may become a valuable, cost-effective addition to the skillslab, if transfer to the operating room can be established. Additionally, we discuss sources of transferable skills to help explain our and previous findings.

Virtual reality simulator improves the acquisition of basic arthroscopy skills in first-year orthopedic surgery residents,"Walbron, P.; Common, H.; Thomazeau, H.; Hosseini, K.; Peduzzi, L.; Bulaid, Y.; Sirveaux, F.","Introduction: Arthroscopy training using a virtual reality (VR) simulator is said to improve the training of orthopedic surgery residents, although it has never been evaluated in a large representative population of first-year residents. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that first-year residents who train on a VR simulator would improve their basic arthroscopy skills more than residents who use other training methods. The primary aim was to compare various arthroscopy-learning techniques after 6 months of training. Population and methods: The study population consisted of 107 first-year residents who were tested twice on a VR arthroscopy simulator (December 2017 and June 2018). The residents were divided into three groups: no specific arthroscopy training (A), non-specific and one-off arthroscopy training (B), 6 months of VR arthroscopy simulator training (C). During the testing, they had to perform the Periscoping exercise (orientation of angled scope) and the Catch the Stars Glenohumeral exercise (extraction of loose bodies). The parameters analyzed were time (s), camera alignment relative to horizontal (%), camera path length (cm) and grasper path length (cm). Result(s): After 6 months, there was a significant difference between groups during the Periscoping exercise in the time (A: 137.8 s; B: 126.7 s; C: 92.2 s) (p < 0.0001), camera alignment (A: 93%; B: 98%; C: 97%) (p = 0.0028), camera path length (A: 116.9 cm; B: 112.5 cm; C: 67.3 cm) (p < 0.0001) and during the Catch the Stars Glenohumeral exercise in the time (A: 112.2 s; B: 103 s; C: 61.4 s) (p < 0.0001), camera path length (A: 46.3 cm; B: 40.9 cm; C: 32.9 cm) (p < 0.0153) and grasper path length (A: 146.4 cm; B: 142.2 cm; C: 95.8 cm) (p < 0.0001). Discussion(s): The residents who participated in the VR arthroscopy simulator training program for 6 months had better results when performing practical exercises and standard arthroscopy tasks than those who did not receive any training or only received only one-off training. Their final performance indicated technical mastery that the other residents had not achieved. Level of Evidence: II, Prospective, comparative, non-randomized study.

C.","Background and Aims: Non-technical skills (NTS), involving cognitive, social and interpersonal skills that complement technical skills, are important for the completion of safe and efficient procedures. We investigated the impact of a simulation-based curriculum with dedicated NTS training on novice endoscopists' performance of clinical colonoscopies. Method(s): A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at a single center. Novice endoscopists were randomized to a control curriculum or a NTS curriculum. The control curriculum involved a didactic session, virtual reality (VR) simulator colonoscopy training, and integrated scenario practice using a VR simulator, a standardized patient, and endoscopy nurse. Feedback and training were provided by experienced endoscopists. The NTS curriculum group received similar training that included a small-group session on NTS, feedback targeting NTS, and access to a self-reflective NTS checklist. The primary outcome was performance during two clinical colonoscopies, assessed using the Joint Advisory Group Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (JAG DOPS) tool. Result(s): Thirty-nine participants completed the study. The NTS group (n = 21) had superior clinical performance during their first (P < 0.001) and second clinical colonoscopies (P <.0.001), compared to the control group (n = 18). The NTS group performed significantly better on the VR simulator (P < 0.05) and in the integrated scenario (P < 0.05).

Skepticism towards advancing VR technology - student acceptance of VR as a teaching and assessment tool in medicine,"Walter, S.; Speidel, R.; Hann, A.; Leitner, J.; Jerg-Bretzke, L.; Kropp, P.; Garbe, J.; Ebner, F.","Objective: The high didactic potential of Virtual Reality (VR) contrasts with the point of view of students that the technology only has a relatively low significance for current and future teaching. This discrepancy was studied in a differentiated manner in order to gear the further development and implementation of VR towards the target group. Method(s): From January 2020 to July 2020, medical students (N=318) were asked to watch ten videos online and rate them on the basis of acceptance indicators (e.g., fun and fairness). Using obstetrics as an example, the videos demonstrated five levels of VR technology functionality (e.g., haptic and adaptive feedback), some of which were visionary, in two use scenarios (teaching and the OSCE). The individual and aggregate indicators were compared with non-parametric testing procedures across application scenarios, functional levels and genders. In addition, correlations between the acceptance and the factors of semester, age, computer affinity, and previous VR experience were analyzed. Result(s): Across all functional levels, VR was more likely to be accepted in the classroom than in the OSCE. Comparisons across functional levels also revealed that the VR ready to be marketed was significantly more accepted than the visionary functions. This skepticism toward advancing VR technology was most pronounced with regard to the vision of autonomous VR examinations and among female students with a low computer affinity. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that the students' reservations are due to a lack of experience with the VR technology. In order for young physicians to become familiar with the technology and to be able to use it competently in the everyday clinical practice in the future, VR should not only be used as a teaching tool but also be part of the curriculum. Practical examinations using VR, on the other hand, are only recommended once the technology has become established in teaching and has been proven to be reliable.

[Chinese],"Wang, C.; Liu, F.; Zhang, W.; Ma, J.; Yao, S.; Xiao, L.; Cheng, Y.; Xu, X.; Lian, Q.; Wang, Q.; Zhang, M.","Physicians educated with traditional surgical training modes cannot meet the current surge in demand for knee joint patients. The aim of this work is to develop a simulation system based on virtual reality technology for the personalized knee replacement surgery. The virtual geometric models of knee joint and instruments were established by 3D reconstruction and CAD modeling technology respectively. We studied the voxelization algorithm and applied it to generate the virtual physical models. By using coordinate match method, the force model of the instrument was established between the device interface and the proxy. The AABB bounding box hierarchy tree was used as the collision detection model, we applied the overlapped intersect way to simulate deformation of tissue and the single point constraint force rendering to simulate the operation process. By setting up the hardware platform consisting of Phantom Omni and computer, and configuring the software environment CHAI 3D and OpenGL, the virtual knee replacement surgery simulation system was constructed. We compared the training time of the actual surgical operation of the professionals who experienced system with that of the control group, and used a questionnaire survey to make assessment of the system. Results showed that the system achieved the simulation of tissue deformation and force haptic feedback of drilling and osteotomy along the planned path in TKA, and the real-time performance of the system was excellent, the visual and haptic update frequency was maintained at 60 Hz and 1000 Hz respectively. The statistical results illustrated that there was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.04) in the actual operation time between the two groups, the questionnaire results were all above the average excellent level (P < 0.05).

3D Virtual Reality Smartphone Training for Chemotherapy Drug Administration by Non-oncology Nurses: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Wang, C. Y.; Lu, C. Y.; Yang, S. Y.; Tsai, S. C.; Huang, T. W.","Chemotherapy agents are cytotoxic materials. Thus, there is a need for the operators to be familiar with the knowledge and procedures before operation. We conducted a randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of an immersive 3D VR teaching of chemotherapy administration operated in a smartphone coupled with a visual and audio device. We adopted a two-arm single-blind design and recruited 83 nurses, and they were randomized using a cluster approach. The VR group learned chemotherapy administration through VR, while the controlled group learned through document reading. The Knowledge and Attitude of Chemotherapy Administration (KACA) was administrated before the intervention, while the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) and the Checklist of Action Accomplishment (CAA) were administrated one month after the intervention. The VR group scored higher than the controlled group in the CAA (95.69 +/- 5.37 vs. 91.98 +/- 9.31, p = 0.02) and the OSCE (73.07 +/- 10.99 vs. 67.44 +/-10.65, p = 0.02). Stepwise regression demonstrated that service years, an education level of undergraduate or above, and VR exposure contributed positively to the OSCE score (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.194, p = 0.028).

The application of virtual reality training for anastomosis during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy,"Wang, F.; Zhang, C.; Guo, F.; Sheng, X.; Ji, J.; Xu, Y.; Cao, Z.; Lyu, J.; Lu, X.; Yang, B.","Objective: To investigate the application of virtual reality training in vesicourethral anastomosis during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Method(s): Three certified robotic urologists who underwent virtual reality training were enrolled in the study group. The other three without training were enrolled in the control group. Parameters were recorded before and after the training. Then a total of 18 patients undergoing RARP were enrolled and randomized assigned to receive anastomosis procedures with certified urologists who either obtained or did not obtain training. The quality of the anastomosis was evaluated. Result(s): For the virtual training evaluation, the overall score was significantly improved from 65.0+/-10.8 to 92.7+/-3.5 (p=0.014); the time of anastomosis was shortened; the economy of motion improved; instrument collisions decreased after training (p<0.05). Besides, the effectiveness of the virtual training was evaluated in the 18 real anastomosis procedures which were completed either by three urologists with training or three urologists without training. Most intriguingly, the average time of anastomosis was shortened from 40.0+/-12.4 min to 25.1+/-7.1 min (p=0.015). The parameters including time of operation, creatinine level of drainage, postoperative hospital stay and duration of catheter drainage were comparable before and after training. Two leakages, which were observed in procedures by doctors without training, needed salvage sutures by a senior doctor.

Impact of Simulation Training on Diagnostic Arthroscopy Performance: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Wang, K. C.; Bernardoni, E. D.; Cotter, E. J.; Cole, B. J.; Verma, N. N.; Romeo, A. A.; Bush-Joseph, C. A.; Bach, B. R.; Frank, R. M.","Purpose: To determine the impact of training on a virtual reality arthroscopy simulator on both simulator and cadaveric performance in novice trainees. Method(s): A randomized controlled trial of 28 participants without prior arthroscopic experience was conducted. All participants received a demonstration of how to use the ArthroVision Virtual Reality Simulator and were then randomized to receive either no training (control group, n = 14) or a fixed protocol of simulation training (n = 14). All participants took a pretest on the simulator, completing 9 tasks ranging from camera-steadying tasks to probing structures. The training group then trained on the simulator (1 time per week for 3 weeks). At week 4, all participants completed a 2-part post-test, including (1) performing all tasks on the simulator and (2) performing a diagnostic arthroscopy on a cadaveric knee and shoulder. An independent, blinded observer assessed the performance on diagnostic arthroscopy using the Arthroscopic Surgical Skill Evaluation Tool scale. To compare differences between non-normally distributed groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. An independent-samples t test was used for normally distributed groups. The Friedman test with pair-wise comparisons using Bonferroni correction was used to compare scores within groups at multiple time points. Bonferroni adjustment was applied as a multiplier to the P value; thus, the alpha level remained consistent. Significance was defined as P <. 05. Result(s): In both groups, all tasks except task 5 (in which completion time was relatively fixed) showed a significant degree of correlation between task completion time and other task-specific metrics. A significant difference between the trained and control groups was found for post-test task completion time scores for all tasks. Qualitative analysis of box plots showed minimal change after 3 trials for most tasks in the training group. There was no statistical correlation between the performance on diagnostic arthroscopy on either the knee or shoulder and simulation training, with no difference in Arthroscopic Surgical Skill Evaluation Tool scores in the training group compared with controls. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that an early ceiling effect is shown on the evaluated arthroscopic simulator model and that additional training past the point of proficiency on modern arthroscopic simulator models does not provide additional transferable benefits on a cadaveric model.

METHOD(S): This was a prospective, randomized control trial with one-to-one randomization and parallel group design. Twenty-eight volunteer novice trainees (medical and premedical students) participated. Using the TraumaVision Virtual Reality Simulator (Swemac, Sweden), subjects performed locking screw placement using the ""perfect circle"" technique. All subjects underwent a pretest and posttest on the simulator. The simulator group completed three additional simulator training sessions. The primary outcome variables were simulator-collected task completion time, success rate, radiation exposure time, and overall score. RESULT(S): No notable difference existed between groups for pretest completion time, radiation use, success rate, or overall score. No notable difference in posttest radiation use or overall procedure score was found between groups. A significant difference existed in posttest total completion time (trained = 251.2 +/- 103.4; control = 497.3 +/- 223.1; P = 0.001) and success rate (64.3% versus 100%; P = 0.041) between groups. In addition, a significant difference existed in variance between groups for completion time (P = 0.029). CONCLUSION(S): These findings suggest that independent simulator practice leads to improved speed and success rates; however, radiation use and overall score do not improve in the same manner.

Development of Training Videos Based on Virtual Reality Side-Cut High-Simulation Simulator of Human Wound Technology and Sealed Sputum Suction,"Wang, M.; Rong, R.; Jia, K.; Li, J.; Zhou, Z.; Ge, W.; Zhang, Q.","The development of information technology and the advancement of the process of educational informatization have provided technical support for education and education reform. The virtual simulation teaching mode is no longer a new thing for people, and it is more and more accepted by people familiar with it. Induction and analysis of short message texts generated by students' online learning can fully understand students, make effective adjustments to the classroom, guide teachers' teaching practice, and optimize the classroom, thereby improving students' learning ability, practical ability, innovation ability, and collaboration. To study the effect of virtual simulation education on improving the skills of medical students, this paper is based on video training and education of virtual reality side-cut high-simulation simulator using case analysis and literature analysis methods. It collects data from databases and builds on online education. The model was developed, and a large number of relevant pieces of literature were read and analyzed through the literature survey method. The research results show that virtual simulation teaching can effectively improve students' technical thinking and ability. Students' technical thinking and ability are about 30% higher than traditional teaching methods, and the cooperation consciousness between students reaches 0.8 consciousness, which can solve the contradiction between popularization and improvement. And to solve the problems of polarization and transformation of underachievers, students' personalities can be fully displayed and developed, and education and teaching will be on the track of quality education. This shows that training videos based on virtual reality technology can play a very good role in improving students' technical mastery.

A new platform for laparoscopic training: initial evaluation of the ex-vivo live multivisceral training device,"Wang, X.; Zhang, K.; Hu, W.; Kuang, M.; Teo, S.; Guo, Z.; Zhao, Q.; He, X.","Background: Various training models have been developed for laparoscopic training. Inanimate models including cadavers, ex-vivo simulator, and virtual reality (VR), are less realistic and often fail to display specific events such as bleeding, bile leakage, etc. Animal models provide more realistic experience, but constraints like cost involved, anesthetic requirement, and ethical approval have limited its application. We have designed a new training ex-vivo simulator-Smagister to address these issues. Method(s): The Smagister consists of a normothermic machine perfusion platform, multivisceral organ of porcine abdominal cavity (liver, gallbladder, pancreas, stomach, intestine, kidney, uterus, bladders, etc.), high-definition display, and software system. Blood gas analysis and number of peristalsis per hour were recorded. A questionnaire was used to subjectively assess vitality of the organ cluster every hour. Three laparoscopic procedures including cholecystectomy (LC), enterotomy closure (LEC) and hepatectomy (LLR) were performed on Smagister, with demonstration of specific events for each procedure. Six experts compared the procedures with actual surgery in terms of feasibility to complete procedures and demonstration of complications. Result(s): The fluctuation of perfusate glucose (6.1-8.2 mmol/L) and lactate (5.82-6.55 mmol/L) suggested metabolic function of the multivisceral organs. The mean number of peristalsis was 2.2/min. The simulated surgical view and anatomic structures closely resembled actual surgery during continuous perfusion (3.5 +/- 1.0, 3.8 +/- 0.8, respectively). The evaluation scores of haptic feedbacks were 3.8 +/- 0.8, resembling live tissue handling. LC, LEC, and LLR were performed well on the Smagister, with clear display of the specific events. All six experts considered Smagister as a suitable training modality for both basic and advanced laparoscopic surgery. Conclusion(s): The amalgamation of live animal model and ex-vivo simulation in Smagister centralizes the virtue of both modalities, expands the training field, and provides high-fidelity laparoscopic training for both novice and senior surgeons.

A virtual-reality simulator and force sensation combined catheter operation training system and its preliminary evaluation,"Wang, Y.; Guo, S.; Tamiya, T.; Hirata, H.; Ishihara, H.; Yin, X.","Background: Endovascular surgery benefits patients because of its superior short convalescence and lack of damage to healthy tissue. However, such advantages require the operator to be equipped with dexterous skills for catheter manipulation without resulting in collateral damage. To achieve this goal, a training system is in high demand. Method(s): A training system integrating a VR simulator and a haptic device has been developed within this context. The VR simulator is capable of providing visual cues which assist the novice for safe catheterization. In addition, the haptic device cooperates with VR simulator to apply sensations at the same time. The training system was tested by non-medical subjects over a five days training session. Result(s): The performance was evaluated in terms of safety criteria and task completion time. The results demonstrate that operation safety is improved by 15.94% and task completion time is cut by 18.80 s maximum. Moreover, according to subjects' reflections, they are more confident in operation. Conclusion(s): The proposed training system constructs a comprehensive training environment that combines visualization and force sensation.

A comparative human-centric analysis of virtual reality and dry lab training tasks on the da vinci surgical platform,"Wang, Z.; Kasman, M.; Martinez, M.; Rege, R.; Zeh, H.; Scott, D.; Fey, A. M.","There is a growing, widespread trend of adopting robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) in clinical care. Dry lab robot training and virtual reality simulation are commonly used to train surgical residents; however, it is unclear whether both types of training are equivalent or can be interchangeable and still achieve the same results in terms of training outcomes. In this paper, we take the first step in comparing the effects of physical and simulated surgical training tasks on human operator kinematics and physiological response to provide a richer understanding of exactly how the user interacts with the actual or simulated surgical robot. Four subjects, with expertise levels ranging from novice to expert surgeon, were recruited to perform three surgical tasks-Continuous Suture, Pick and Place, Tubes, with three repetitions-on two training platforms: (1) the da Vinci Si Skills Simulator and (2) da Vinci S robot, in a randomized order. We collected physiological response and kinematic movement data through body-worn sensors for a total of 72 individual experimental trials. A range of expertise was chosen for this experiment to wash out inherent differences based on expertise and only focus on inherent differences between the virtual reality and dry lab platforms. Our results show significant differences (p-value<0.05) between tasks done on the simulator and surgical robot. Specifically, robotic tasks resulted in significantly higher muscle activation and path length, and significantly lower economy of volume. The individual tasks also had significant differences in various kinematic and physiological metrics, leading to significant interaction effects between the task type and training platform. These results indicate that the presence of the robotic system may make surgical training tasks more difficult for the human operator. Thus, the potentially detrimental effects of virtual reality training alone are an important topic for future investigation.

The utility of virtual patient simulations for clinical reasoning education,"Watari, T.; Tokuda, Y.; Owada, M.; Onigata, K.","Virtual Patient Simulations (VPSs) have been cited as a novel learning strategy, but there is little evidence that VPSs yield improvements in clinical reasoning skills and medical knowledge. This study aimed to clarify the effectiveness of VPSs for improving clinical reasoning skills among medical students, and to compare improvements in knowledge or clinical reasoning skills relevant to specific clinical scenarios. We enrolled 210 fourth-year medical students in March 2017 and March 2018 to participate in a real-time pre-post experimental design conducted in a large lecture hall by using a clicker. A VPS program (Body Interact, Portugal) was implemented for one two-hour class session using the same methodology during both years. A pre-post 20-item multiple-choice questionnaire (10 knowledge and 10 clinical reasoning items) was used to evaluate learning outcomes. A total of 169 students completed the program. Participants showed significant increases in average total post-test scores, both on knowledge items (pre-test: median = 5, mean = 4.78, 95% CI (4.55-5.01); post-test: median = 5, mean = 5.12, 95% CI (4.90-5.43); p-value = 0.003) and clinical reasoning items (pre-test: median = 5, mean = 5.3 95%, CI (4.98-5.58); post-test: median = 8, mean = 7.81, 95% CI (7.57-8.05); p-value < 0.001).

Simulation training improves surgical proficiency and safety during diagnostic shoulder arthroscopy performed by residents,"Waterman, B. R.; Martin, K. D.; Cameron, K. L.; Owens, B. D.; Belmont, P. J.","Although virtual reality simulators have established construct validity, no studies have proven transfer of skills from a simulator to improved in vivo surgical skill. The current authors hypothesized that simulation training would improve residents' basic arthroscopic performance and safety. Twenty-two orthopedic surgery trainees were randomized into simulation or standard practice groups. At baseline testing, all of the participants performed simulator-based testing and a supervised, in vivo diagnostic shoulder arthroscopy with video recording. The simulation group subsequently received 1 hour of total instruction during a 3-month period, and the standard practice group received no simulator training. After intervention, both groups were reevaluated with simulator testing and a second recorded diagnostic shoulder arthroscopy. Two blinded, independent experts evaluated arthroscopic performance using the anatomic checklist, Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET) score, and total elapsed time. All outcome measures were compared within and between groups. After intervention, mean time required by the simulation group to complete the simulator task (30.64 seconds) was 8+/-1.2 seconds faster than the time required by the control group (38.64 seconds; P=.001). Probe distance (51.65 mm) was improved by 41.2+/-6.08 mm compared with the control (92.83 mm; P=.001). When comparing ASSET safety scores, the simulation group was competent (3.29) and significantly better than the control group (3.00; P=.005) during final arthroscopic testing. This study establishes transfer validity for an arthroscopic shoulder simulator model. Simulator training for residents in training can decrease surgical times, improve basic surgical skills, and confer greater patient safety during shoulder arthroscopy.

Establishing objective benchmarks in robotic virtual reality simulation at the level of a competent surgeon using the RobotiX Mentor simulator,"Watkinson, W.; Raison, N.; Abe, T.; Harrison, P.; Khan, S.; Van der Poel, H.; Dasgupta, P.; Ahmed, K.","RESULTS: Objective benchmarks derived from the 25th centile of the mean scores of the advanced intermediates provided suitably challenging yet also achievable targets for training surgeons. The disparity in scores was greatest for the advanced exercises. Novice surgeons are able to achieve the benchmarks across all exercises in the majority of metrics. CONCLUSION: We have successfully created this proof-of-concept study, which requires validation in a larger cohort. Objective benchmarks obtained from the 25th centile of the mean scores of advanced intermediates provide clinically relevant benchmarks at the standard of a competent robotic surgeon that are challenging yet also attainable. That can be used within a VR training curriculum allowing participants to track and monitor their progress in a structured and progressional manner through five exercises.

Harnessing Augmented Reality and CT to Teach First-Year Medical Students Head and Neck Anatomy,"Weeks, J. K.; Pakpoor, J.; Park, B. J.; Robinson, N. J.; Rubinstein, N. A.; Prouty, S. M.; Nachiappan, A. C.","Rationale and Objectives: Three-dimensional (3D) visualization has been shown to benefit new generations of medical students and physicians-in-training in a variety of contexts. However, there is limited research directly comparing student performance after using 3D tools to those using two-dimensional (2D) screens. Material(s) and Method(s): A CT was performed on a donated cadaver and a 3D CT hologram was created. A total of 30 first-year medical students were randomly assigned into two groups to review head and neck anatomy in a teaching session that incorporated CT. The first group used an augmented reality headset, while the second group used a laptop screen. The students were administered a five-question anatomy test before and after the session. Two-tailed t-tests were used for statistical comparison of pretest and posttest performance within and between groups. A feedback survey was distributed for qualitative data. Result(s): Pretest vs. posttest comparison of average percentage of questions answered correctly demonstrated both groups showing significant in-group improvement (p < 0.05), from 59% to 95% in the augmented reality group, and from 57% to 80% in the screen group. Between-group analysis indicated that posttest performance was significantly better in the augmented reality group (p = 0.022, effect size = 0.73). Conclusion(s): Immersive 3D visualization has the potential to improve short-term anatomic recall in the head and neck compared to traditional 2D screen-based review, as well as engage millennial learners to learn better in anatomy laboratory. Our findings may reflect additional benefit gained from the stereoscopic depth cues present in augmented reality-based visualization.

"Intra-operative disruptions, surgeon's mental workload, and technical performance in a full-scale simulated procedure","Weigl, M.; Stefan, P.; Abhari, K.; Wucherer, P.; Fallavollita, P.; Lazarovici, M.; Weidert, S.; Euler, E.; Catchpole, K.","Background and aim: Surgical flow disruptions occur frequently and jeopardize perioperative care and surgical performance. So far, insights into subjective and cognitive implications of intra-operative disruptions for surgeons and inherent consequences for performance are inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate the effect of surgical flow disruption on surgeon's intra-operative workload and technical performance. Method(s): In a full-scale OR simulation, 19 surgeons were randomly allocated to either of the two disruption scenarios (telephone call vs. patient discomfort). Using a mixed virtual reality simulator with a computerized, high-fidelity mannequin, all surgeons were trained in performing a vertebroplasty procedure and subsequently performed such a procedure under experimental conditions. Standardized measures on subjective workload and technical performance (trocar positioning deviation from expert-defined standard, number, and duration of X-ray acquisitions) were collected. Result(s): Intra-operative workload during simulated disruption scenarios was significantly higher compared to training sessions (p < .01). Surgeons in the telephone call scenario experienced significantly more distraction compared to their colleagues in the patient discomfort scenario (p < .05). However, workload tended to be increased in surgeons who coped with distractions due to patient discomfort. Technical performance was not significantly different between both disruption scenarios. We found a significant association between surgeons' intra-operative workload and technical performance such that surgeons with increased mental workload tended to perform worse (beta = .55, p = .04). Conclusion(s): Surgical flow disruptions affect surgeons' intra-operative workload. Increased mental workload was associated with inferior technical performance. Our simulation-based findings emphasize the need to establish smooth surgical flow which is characterized by a low level of process deviations and disruptions.

Colonoscopy procedure simulation: Virtual reality training based on a real time computational approach,"Wen, T.; Medveczky, D.; Wu, J.","Background: Colonoscopy plays an important role in the clinical screening and management of colorectal cancer. The traditional 'see one, do one, teach one' training style for such invasive procedure is resource intensive and ineffective. Given that colonoscopy is difficult, and time-consuming to master, the use of virtual reality simulators to train gastroenterologists in colonoscopy operations offers a promising alternative. Method(s): In this paper, a realistic and real-time interactive simulator for training colonoscopy procedure is presented, which can even include polypectomy simulation. Our approach models the colonoscopy as thick flexible elastic rods with different resolutions which are dynamically adaptive to the curvature of the colon. More material characteristics of this deformable material are integrated into our discrete model to realistically simulate the behavior of the colonoscope. Conclusion(s): We present a simulator for training colonoscopy procedure. In addition, we propose a set of key aspects of our simulator that give fast, high fidelity feedback to trainees. We also conducted an initial validation of this colonoscopic simulator to determine its clinical utility and efficacy.

Three-Dimensional Virtual Reality Spinal Cord Stimulator Training Improves Trainee Procedural Confidence and Performance,"White, W. W.; Jung, M. J.","Objective: This study evaluates the use of a three-dimensional virtual reality spinal cord stimulator (SCS) training system to enhance trainee confidence and technical proficiency with interlaminar epidural access and SCS placement. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 14 trainees comprising pain fellows and residents were recruited. Experience and confidence levels were established through pre- and postsurveys. Each trainee performed two sessions placing SCS leads using the training device. In between attempts, a standardized teaching session was performed with the simulator. Performance during each attempt was assessed through objective measures such as needle angle and an evaluation rubric Pain Procedure Rating System (PaPRS). Statistical analysis was performed through paired sample t-test to evaluate a single group between separate trials, whereas unpaired t-test was used to assess the difference between the two groups at baseline or within a single trial. Result(s): Participants had statistically significant improvements in their ability to safely access the epidural space (57.1% improving to 100%, p < 0.01) and to effectively drive percutaneous leads to the target level (7.1% improving to 71.4%, p < 0.001). The mean confidence levels improved by 71.4% for interlaminar epidural access (p < 0.001) and 306% for SCS placement (p < 0.001). The mean procedural efficiency (total procedure time) improved by 43.2% (p < 0.001). The PaPRS total score increased by an average of 73.3% (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Virtually simulated neuromodulation training is a viable and effective method of augmenting neuromodulation education.

Each participant completed nine surgical tasks across two modules on the simulator, followed by a questionnaire to evaluate subjective realism (face validity), task importance (content validity), feasibility, and acceptability. Outcome measures of novice, intermediate, and expert groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U-tests to assess construct validity. Result(s): Construct validity was demonstrated in a total of 17/25 performance evaluation metrics (p < 0.001). Experts performed better than intermediates with regard to time taken to complete the first (p = 0.002) and second (p = 0.043) module, number of instrument collisions (p = 0.040), path length (p = 0.049), number of cuts >2 mm deep (p = 0.033), average distance from suture target (p = 0.015), and number of suture breakages (p = 0.038).

Training Effectiveness of a Wide Area Virtual Environment in Medical Simulation,"Wier, G. S.; Tree, R.; Nusr, R.","INTRODUCTION: The success of war fighters and medical personnel handling traumatic injuries largely depends on the quality of training they receive before deployment. The purpose of this study was to gauge the utility of a Wide Area Virtual Environment (WAVE) as a training adjunct by comparing and evaluating student performance, measuring sense of realism, and assessing the impact on student satisfaction with their training exposure in an immersive versus a field environment. METHODS: This comparative prospective cohort study examined the utility of a three-screen WAVE where subjects were immersed in the training environment with medical simulators. Standard field training commenced for the control group subjects. Medical skills, time to completion, and Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety objective metrics were assessed for each team (n = 94). In addition, self-efficacy questionnaires were collected for each subject (N = 470). RESULTS: Medical teams received poorer overall team scores (F1,186 = 0.756, P = 0.001), took longer to complete the scenario (F1,186 = 25.15, P = 0.001), and scored lower on The National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians trauma assessment checklist (F1,186 = 1.13, P = 0.000) in the WAVE versus the field environment. Critical thinking and realism factors within the self-efficacy questionnaires scored higher in the WAVE versus the field [(F1,466 = 8.04, P = 0.005), (F1,465 = 18.57, P = 0.000), and (F1,466 = 53.24, P = 0.000), respectively].

Telestration with augmented reality for visual presentation of intraoperative target structures in minimally invasive surgery: a randomized controlled study,"Wild, C.; Lang, F.; Gerhauser, A. S.; Schmidt, M. W.; Kowalewski, K. F.; Petersen, J.; Kenngott, H. G.; Muller-Stich, B. P.; Nickel, F.","Aims: In minimally invasive surgery (MIS), intraoperative guidance has been limited to verbal communication without direct visual guidance. Communication issues and mistaken instructions in training procedures can hinder correct identification of anatomical structures on the MIS screen. The iSurgeon system was developed to provide visual guidance in the operating room by telestration with augmented reality (AR). Method(s): Laparoscopic novices (n = 60) were randomized in two groups in a cross-over design: group 1 trained only with verbal guidance first and then with additional telestration with AR on the operative screen and vice versa for group 2. Training consisted of laparoscopic basic training and subsequently a specifically designed training course, including a porcine laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Outcome included time needed for training, performance with Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS), and Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) score for LC, complications, and subjective workload (NASA-TLX questionnaire). Result(s): Telestration with AR led to significantly faster total training time (1163 +/- 275 vs. 1658 +/- 375 s, p < 0.001) and reduced error rates. LC on a porcine liver was performed significantly better (GOALS 21 +/- 5 vs. 18 +/- 4, p < 0.007 and OSATS 67 +/- 11 vs. 61 +/- 8, p < 0.015) and with less complications (13.3% vs. 40%, p < 0.020) with AR. Subjective workload and stress were significantly reduced during training with AR (33.6 +/- 12.0 vs. 30.6 +/- 12.9, p < 0.022).

Becoming virtually real: Using the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training (VERTTM) platform for the summative assessment of performance in a palliative radiotherapy treatment technique,"Williams, A.; Blane, S.","Introduction: Direct observation in the radiotherapy clinic remains the primary method for the assessment of procedural skills. But with increasing automation and reductions in clinical placement time during the recent pandemic, the role of summative, simulation-based assessment is being revisited. The aim of this article is to share early experiences of using Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training (VERT) in the assessment of a palliative, parallel pair, external beam treatment delivery technique in a new pre-registration undergraduate programme. Method(s): Eight first-year students completed a campus-based individual virtual assessment using virtual patient plans representing metastatic disease in the brain and pelvis and late-stage primary lung tumours. Performance was logged on a 25-item checklist for pre and post-procedure checks and treatment delivery tasks. Result(s): All eight students participated in the assessment with seven students (87.5%) achieving a pass grade at first attempt. The course team observed that participants demonstrated a range of skills and abilities and were able to compare and contrast individual approaches to patient positioning. Specific feed-forward action points were also highlighted as areas for students' to focus on during their second placement. The project also identified logistical benefits for assessment teams. Conclusion(s): While these experiences are a single snapshot, a VERT simulation-based summative assessment is feasible and identified benefits included controlled observation and structured feedback on individual performance and scheduling pressure reductions for clinical teams. However, more work is needed to determine the psychometric qualities and predictability of performance in more complex techniques. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Consideration of using virtual reality for teaching neonatal resuscitation to midwifery students,"Williams, J.; Jones, D.; Walker, R.","Within the last decade, there has been significant change in the way tertiary midwifery education has been delivered to students. The use of blended teaching methods and the introduction of simulated learning experiences has been observed in the literature to improve students' self-confidence, competence, clinical judgement and decision-making abilities. Simulation is seen to be particularly important when practising skills that may be infrequently encountered in practice, such as clinical emergencies. Neonatal resuscitation is the most common neonatal emergency encountered within midwifery today, with up to 15% of babies requiring some form of resuscitation at birth. Recent research describes the benefits of using a multi-modal approach to teaching neonatal resuscitation, utilising both theory and simulated learning methods. One emerging method of simulation is that of virtual reality (VR), which has been recognised for its enormous educational potential in risk-free clinical skills training. Currently, however, there is limited research looking at the use of VR in emergency skills training. This article examines the literature to highlight the potential benefits that VR simulation could provide for emergency skills training, as well as the potential challenges that should be acknowledged.

A 3D virtual reality ophthalmoscopy trainer,"Wilson, A. S.; O'Connor, J.; Taylor, L.; Carruthers, D.","BACKGROUND: Performing eye examinations is an important clinical skill that medical students often find difficult to become proficient in. This paper describes the development and evaluation of an innovative 3D virtual reality (VR) training application to support learning these skills. METHODS: The VR ophthalmoscope was developed by a clinical team and technologist using the unity game engine, smartphone and virtual reality headset. It has a series of tasks that include performing systematic eye examinations, identifying common eye pathologies and a knowledge quiz. As part of their clinical training, 15 fourth-year medical students were surveyed for their views on this teaching approach. The Technology Acceptance Model was used to evaluate perceived usefulness and ease of use. Data were also collected on the usability of the app, together with the students' written comments about it. RESULTS: Users agreed that the teaching approach improved their understanding of ophthalmoscopy (n = 14), their ability to identify landmarks in the eye (n = 14) and their ability to recognise abnormalities (n = 15). They found the app easy to use (n = 15), the teaching approach informative (n = 13) and that it would increase students' confidence when performing these tasks in future (n = 15). Performing eye examinations is an important clinical skill DISCUSSION: The evaluation showed that a VR app can successfully simulate the processes involved in performing eye examinations. The app was highly rated for all elements of perceived usefulness, ease of use and usability. Medical students stated that they would like to be taught other medical skills in this way in future.

Improved laparoscopic skills in gynaecology trainees following a simulation-training program using take-home box trainers,"Wilson, E.; Janssens, S.; McLindon, L. A.; Hewett, D. G.; Jolly, B.; Beckmann, M.","Background: Lack of time and access to equipment are recognised barriers to simulation training. Aim(s): To investigate the effect of a take-home laparoscopic simulator training program on the laparoscopic skills of gynaecology trainees. Method(s): Participants (n = 17 in 2015, n = 16 in 2016) were supplied with a box trainer, associated equipment and instructions on self-directed training. A program was designed and implemented in 2015 comprising of ten weekly laparoscopic skills tasks and modified in 2016 to eight monthly tasks. Half of the participants were randomly allocated a supervisor. Participants performed baseline and post-training assessments of laparoscopic skills in a box trainer task (thread transfer) and virtual reality simulator tasks (laparoscopic tubal ligation and bilateral oophorectomy). Result(s): Trainees in 2015 demonstrated an improvement in the median time to complete the laparoscopic tubal ligation task (baseline 124 s vs post-training 91 s, P = 0.041). There was no difference in the number of tubal ligation bleeding incidents, or in the time taken to complete the box trainer thread transfer task. In 2016 trainees demonstrated improvement in tubal ligation time (baseline 251 vs 71 post-training, P = 0.021) and bilateral oophorectomy time (baseline 891 s vs 504 post-training, P = 0.025). There was no significant difference in other outcome measures. There was no difference found in performance when groups were compared by supervisor allocation. Conclusion(s): A take-home box trainer simulation-training program was associated with improvement in laparoscopic skills. This type of program may improve trainee access to simulation training.

A multimedia paediatric cardiology assessment tool for medical students and general paediatric trainees: Development and validation,"Wilson, H. C.; Lim, T. R.; Axelrod, D. M.; Werho, D. K.; Handler, S. S.; Mullan, P. B.; Cooke, J. M.; Owens, S. T.","Background: Understanding how cardiovascular structure and physiology guide management is critically important in paediatric cardiology. However, few validated educational tools are available to assess trainee knowledge. To address this deficit, paediatric cardiologists and fellows from four institutions collaborated to develop a multimedia assessment tool for use with medical students and paediatric residents. This tool was developed in support of a novel 3-dimensional virtual reality curriculum created by our group. Method(s): Educational domains were identified, and questions were iteratively developed by a group of clinicians from multiple centres to assess understanding of key concepts. To evaluate content validity, content experts completed the assessment and reviewed items, rating item relevance to educational domains using a 4-point Likert scale. An item-level content validity index was calculated for each question, and a scale-level content validity index was calculated for the assessment tool, with scores of >=0.78 and >=0.90, respectively, representing excellent content validity. Result(s): The mean content expert assessment score was 92% (range 88-97%). Two questions yielded <=50% correct content expert answers. The item-level content validity index for 29 out of 32 questions was >=0.78, and the scale-level content validity index was 0.92. Qualitative feedback included suggestions for future improvement. Questions with <=50% content expert agreement and item-level content validity index scores <0.78 were removed, yielding a 27-question assessment tool. Conclusion(s): We describe a multi-centre effort to create and validate a multimedia assessment tool which may be implemented within paediatric trainee cardiology curricula. Future efforts may focus on content refinement and expansion to include additional educational domains. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Machine Learning Identification of Surgical and Operative Factors Associated with Surgical Expertise in Virtual Reality Simulation,"Winkler-Schwartz, A.; Yilmaz, R.; Mirchi, N.; Bissonnette, V.; Ledwos, N.; Siyar, S.; Azarnoush, H.; Karlik, B.; Del Maestro, R.","Importance: Despite advances in the assessment of technical skills in surgery, a clear understanding of the composites of technical expertise is lacking. Surgical simulation allows for the quantitation of psychomotor skills, generating data sets that can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms. Objective(s): To identify surgical and operative factors selected by a machine learning algorithm to accurately classify participants by level of expertise in a virtual reality surgical procedure. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Fifty participants from a single university were recruited between March 1, 2015, and May 31, 2016, to participate in a case series study at McGill University Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre. Data were collected at a single time point and no follow-up data were collected. Individuals were classified a priori as expert (neurosurgery staff), seniors (neurosurgical fellows and senior residents), juniors (neurosurgical junior residents), and medical students, all of whom participated in 250 simulated tumor resections. Exposures: All individuals participated in a virtual reality neurosurgical tumor resection scenario. Each scenario was repeated 5 times. Main Outcomes and Measures: Through an iterative process, performance metrics associated with instrument movement and force, resection of tissues, and bleeding generated from the raw simulator data output were selected by K-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, discriminant analysis, and support vector machine algorithms to most accurately determine group membership. Result(s): A total of 50 individuals (9 women and 41 men; mean [SD] age, 33.6 [9.5] years; 14 neurosurgeons, 4 fellows, 10 senior residents, 10 junior residents, and 12 medical students) participated. Neurosurgeons were in practice between 1 and 25 years, with 9 (64%) involving a predominantly cranial practice. The K-nearest neighbor algorithm had an accuracy of 90% (45 of 50), the naive Bayes algorithm had an accuracy of 84% (42 of 50), the discriminant analysis algorithm had an accuracy of 78% (39 of 50), and the support vector machine algorithm had an accuracy of 76% (38 of 50). The K-nearest neighbor algorithm used 6 performance metrics to classify participants, the naive Bayes algorithm used 9 performance metrics, the discriminant analysis algorithm used 8 performance metrics, and the support vector machine algorithm used 8 performance metrics. Two neurosurgeons, 1 fellow or senior resident, 1 junior resident, and 1 medical student were misclassified. Conclusions and Relevance: In a virtual reality neurosurgical tumor resection study, a machine learning algorithm successfully classified participants into 4 levels of expertise with 90% accuracy. These findings suggest that algorithms may be capable of classifying surgical expertise with greater granularity and precision than has been previously demonstrated in surgery..

Design and evaluation of an augmented reality simulator using leap motion,"Wright, T.; De Ribaupierre, S.; Eagleson, R.","Advances in virtual and augmented reality (AR) are having an impact on the medical field in areas such as surgical simulation. Improvements to surgical simulation will provide students and residents with additional training and evaluation methods. This is particularly important for procedures such as the endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), which residents perform regularly. Simulators such as NeuroTouch, have been designed to aid in training associated with this procedure. The authors have designed an affordable and easily accessible ETV simulator, and compare it with the existing NeuroTouch for its usability and training effectiveness. This simulator was developed using Unity, Vuforia and the leap motion (LM) for an AR environment. The participants, 16 novices and two expert neurosurgeons, were asked to complete 40 targeting tasks. Participants used the NeuroTouch tool or a virtual hand controlled by the LM to select the position and orientation for these tasks. The length of time to complete each task was recorded and the trajectory log files were used to calculate performance. The resulting data from the novices' and experts' speed and accuracy are compared, and they discuss the objective performance of training in terms of the speed and accuracy of targeting accuracy for each system.",2017,,Healthcare Technology Letters,4(5),,210-215,619263314,,,#5473,Wright 2017,,
Virtual Simulation in Undergraduate Medical Education: A Scoping Review of Recent Practice,"Wu, Q.; Wang, Y.; Lu, L.; Chen, Y.; Long, H.; Wang, J.","Virtual simulation (VS) as an emerging interactive pedagogical strategy has been paid more and more attentions in the undergraduate medical education. Because of the fast development of modern computer simulation technologies, more and more advanced and emerging VS-based instructional practices are constantly increasing to promote medical education in diverse forms. In order to describe an overview of the current trends in VS-based medical teaching and learning, this scoping review presented a worldwide analysis of 92 recently published articles of VS in the undergraduate medical teaching and learning. The results indicated that 98% of included articles were from Europe, North America, and Asia, suggesting a possible inequity in digital medical education. Half (52%) studies reported the immersive virtual reality (VR) application. Evidence for educational effectiveness of VS in medical students' knowledge or skills was sufficient as per Kirkpatrick's model of outcome evaluation. Recently, VS has been widely integrated in surgical procedural training, emergency and pediatric emergency medicine training, teaching of basic medical sciences, medical radiation and imaging, puncture or catheterization training, interprofessional medical education, and other case-based learning experiences. Some challenges, such as accessibility of VS instructional resources, lack of infrastructure, ""decoupling"" users from reality, as well as how to increase students' motivation and engagement, should be addressed.

Effect of virtual reality training to decreases rates of needle stick/sharp injuries in new-coming medical and nursing interns in Taiwan,"Wu, S. H.; Huang, C. C.; Huang, S. S.; Yang, Y. Y.; Liu, C. W.; Shulruf, B.; Chen, C. H.","PURPOSE: Senior nursing and medical interns' lack of familiarity and confidence with respect to practicing universal precaution for the prevention of occupational needle stick (NSI)/sharp (SI) injuries may harm themselves. Trainees' self-reported NSI/SI rate was known to be especially high during the first two months of internship in Taiwan. This prospective cohort study aimed to know the effect of new developed (virtual reality (VR) game, which uses the Gangne's learning model to improved universal precaution for NSI/SI prevention and decrease the rates of needle stick/sharp injuries in new-coming medical and nursing interns in Taiwan. . METHOD(S): From 2017 to 2019, the VR system was developed and applied in training of 59 new-coming nursing and 50 medical interns. Occupational NSI/SI prevention was sought to be achieved through a game of right and wrong choices for safe or unsafe universal precaution behaviors. RESULT(S): In comparison with medical interns, a higher proportion of nursing interns have had the past experiences of deep occupational NSI/SI. Before VR training, the familiarity and confidence for NSI/SI prevention were higher among nursing interns than medical interns. Trainees with past experiences of deep NSI/SI exhibited better performance on the accuracy rate and time need for complete 20 decisions than those without past experiences in VR practice. The performances of all trainees were improved after VR training. A high proportion of trainees reported that the VR-based training significantly decreased their anxiety about NSI/SI prevention. CONCLUSION(S): This self-developed VR game system using Gangne's flow improved universal precaution for NSI/SI prevention and reduced the NSI/SI rates in the first two months of nursing and medical internship.",2020,1-Jan,Journal of educational evaluation for health professions,17,,1,630661483,,,#5485,Wu 2020,,

Y.","Although they receive regular training, the survey we administered to our junior physicians and lab technicians revealed that they lack familiarity and confidence regarding the proper segregation/disposal of clinical wastes. In this pilot prospective study, carried out between September 2017 and September 2019, we developed a virtual reality (VR) simulation and integrated it into the steps of Gangen's training flow. Next, we analysed objective performance, recorded by the App in the VR system as well as the subjective self-assessments of 96 junior physicians and lab technicians after two practices of VR games. Before receiving training, lab technicians' self-assessed familiarity and confidence regarding proper clinical wastes segregation/disposal were higher than among physicians. Compared with the first VR game, we noted greater improvement in accuracy as well as a higher percentage of shortened time to complete 10 actions of segregation/disposal of VR clinical wastes, among junior physicians/male trainees, that of junior lab technicians/female trainees in the second VR game. Most of the trainees (81%-88%) reported that they found the VR game-based training to be useful, in contrast to poster-mass media-based training. Our initial positive results indicated the possibility of applying this VR game-based simulation system to regular institution-wide staff education in future.

The Efficacy of Immersive Virtual Reality Surgical Simulator Training for Pedicle Screw Placement: A Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Trial,"Xin, B.; Chen, G.; Wang, Y.; Bai, G.; Gao, X.; Chu, J.; Xiao, J.; Liu, T.","Purpose: To assess efficacy of immersive virtual reality (VR) surgical simulator training for pedicle screw placement (PSP) in surgical graduate students. Method(s): Sixteen inexperienced surgical graduate students were equally randomly assigned to an experimental group (VR group) and a control group (non-VR group). Students in the VR group performed PSP on the immersive VR surgical simulator, and students in the non-VR group were given a traditional introductory teaching session before a cadaver test. Eight adult fresh cadavers, 6 male and 2 female, were collected and randomly allocated to the 2 groups. Each group performed bilateral T11-L4 PSP on the cadavers independently, and the outcomes of PSP in terms of accuracy, success rate, and efficiency were assessed by computed tomography and compared between the 2 groups statistically. Result(s): Accuracy rate of PSP in the VR group was 89.6% versus 60.4% in the non-VR group (P < 0.05), success rate was 100% versus 79.2% (P < 0.05), and mean time was 2.8 +/- 1 minutes versus 4.9 +/- 1 minutes (P < 0.05), all showing significant differences between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): The immersive VR surgical simulator for PSP training model is superior to the traditional training model in terms of accuracy, success rate, and efficiency, showing potential in training new orthopedic spine surgeons.

"Face, content, construct, and concurrent validity of a novel robotic surgery patient-side simulator: the XperienceTM Team Trainer","Xu, S.; Perez, M.; Perrenot, C.; Hubert, N.; Hubert, J.","Objectives: To determine the face, content, construct, and concurrent validity of the XperienceTM Team Trainer (XTT) as an assessment tool of robotic surgical bed-assistance skills. Method(s): Subjects were recruited during a robotic surgery curriculum. They were divided into three groups: the group RA with robotic bed-assistance experience, the group LS with laparoscopic surgical experience, and the control group without bed-assistance or laparoscopic experience. The subjects first performed two standard FLS exercises on a laparoscopic simulator for the assessment of basic laparoscopic skills. After that, they performed three virtual reality exercises on XTT, and then performed similar exercises on physical models on a da Vinci<sup></sup> box trainer. Result(s): Twenty-eight persons volunteered for and completed the tasks. Most expert subjects agreed on the realism of XTT and the three exercises, and also their interest for teamwork and bed-assistant training. The group RA and the group LS demonstrated a similar level of basic laparoscopic skills. Both groups performed better than the control group on the XTT exercises (p < 0.05). The performance superiority of the group RA over LS was observed but not statistically significant. Correlation of performance was determined between the tests on XTT and on da Vinci<sup></sup> box trainer. Conclusion(s): The introduction of XTT facilitates the training of bedside assistants and emphasizes the importance of teamwork, which may change the paradigm of robotic surgery training in the near future. As an assessment tool of bed-assistance skills, XTT proves face, content, and concurrent validity. However, these results should be qualified considering the potential limitations of this exploratory study with a relatively small sample size.

Transferability of laparoscopic skills using the virtual reality simulator,"Yang, C.; Kalinitschenko, U.; Helmert, J. R.; Weitz, J.; Reissfelder, C.; Mees, S. T.","Background: Skill transfer represents an important issue in surgical education, and is not well understood. The aim of this randomized study is to assess the transferability of surgical skills between two laparoscopic abdominal procedures using the virtual reality simulator in surgical novices. Method(s): From September 2016 to July 2017, 44 surgical novices were randomized into two groups and underwent a proficiency-based basic training consisting of five selected simulated laparoscopic tasks. In group 1, participants performed an appendectomy training on the virtual reality simulator until they reached a defined proficiency. They moved on to the tutorial procedural tasks of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Participants in group 2 started with the tutorial procedural tasks of laparoscopic cholecystectomy directly. Finishing the training, participants of both groups were required to perform a complete cholecystectomy on the simulator. Time, safety and economy parameters were analysed. Result(s): Significant differences in the demographic characteristics and previous computer games experience between the two groups were not noted. Both groups took similar time to complete the proficiency-based basic training. Participants in group 1 needed significantly less movements (388.6 +/- 98.6 vs. 446.4 +/- 81.6; P < 0.05) as well as shorter path length (810.2 +/- 159.5 vs. 945.5 +/- 187.8 cm; P < 0.05) to complete the cholecystectomy compared to group 2. Time and safety parameters did not differ significantly between both groups. Conclusion(s): The data demonstrate a positive transfer of motor skills between laparoscopic appendectomy and cholecystectomy on the virtual reality simulator; however, the transfer of cognitive skills is limited. Separate training curricula seem to be necessary for each procedure for trainees to practise task-specific cognitive skills effectively. Mentoring could help trainees to get a deeper understanding of the procedures, thereby increasing the chance for the transfer of acquired skills.

Cognitive and motor skill competence are different: Results from a prospective randomized trial using virtual reality simulator and educational video in laparoscopic cholecystectomy,"Yang, C.; Sander, F.; Helmert, J. R.; Weiss, C.; Weitz, J.; Reissfelder, C.; Mees, S. T.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive transfer represents an important issue in surgical education. It is essential for the acquisition of competence, such as decision making and error avoidance. This randomized study aims to compare the effectivity of cognitive transfer by observing the surgery versus using modern virtual reality simulators for learning a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHOD(S): This was a prospective, randomized, single centre study. 40 medical students from a university hospital, a tertiary care teaching institution, were enrolled. After a short introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, they were randomized into two groups (video group and simulator group). In the video group, participants watched the step-by-step educational video twice. In the simulator group, participants underwent training using the virtual reality simulator, including tutorial procedural tasks of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as well as a complete cholecystectomy on the simulator. After the training, cognitive competence including decision making and error awareness was assessed using a questionnaire. RESULT(S): In the most critical step of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, ""Dissection in Calot's triangle"", as well as in the aspect of planning next step, the video group was superior significantly (P = 0.038 and P = 0.04). No significant differences concerning the recognition of critical anatomical structures, choosing the necessary instruments as well as error awareness were found. CONCLUSION(S): Learning by watching a high-quality educational video is more effective in acquiring the cognitive competence to combine learned single tasks. Traditional learning means as watching educational videos and modern, sophisticated VRS should be deployed complementarily to establish cognitive and motor competencies separately.

Efficacy of a Virtual Arthroscopic Simulator for Orthopaedic Surgery Residents by Year in Training,"Yari, S. S.; Jandhyala, C. K.; Sharareh, B.; Athiviraham, A.; Shybut, T. B.","Background: Virtual reality arthroscopic simulators are an attractive option for resident training and are increasingly used across training programs. However, no study has analyzed the utility of simulators for trainees based on their level of training/postgraduate year (PGY). Purpose/Hypothesis: The primary aim of this study was to determine the utility of the ArthroS arthroscopic simulator for orthopaedic trainees based on their level of training. We hypothesized that residents at all levels would show similar improvements in performance after completion of the training modules. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Method(s): Eighteen orthopaedic surgery residents performed diagnostic knee and shoulder tasks on the ArthroS simulator. Participants completed a series of training modules and then repeated the diagnostic tasks. Correlation coefficients (r<sup>2</sup>) were calculated for improvements in the mean composite score (based on the Imperial Global Arthroscopy Rating Scale [IGARS]) as a function of PGY. Result(s): The mean improvement in the composite score for participants as a whole was 11.2 +/- 10.0 points (P =.0003) for the knee simulator and 14.9 +/- 10.9 points (P =.0352) for the shoulder simulator. When broken down by PGY, all groups showed improvement, with greater improvements seen for junior-level residents in the knee simulator and greater improvements seen for senior-level residents in the shoulder simulator. Analysis of variance for the score improvement variable among the different PGY groups yielded an f value of 1.640 (P =.2258) for the knee simulator data and an f value of 0.2292 (P =.917) for the shoulder simulator data. The correlation coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>) was -0.866 for the knee score improvement and 0.887 for the shoulder score improvement. Conclusion(s): Residents training on a virtual arthroscopic simulator made significant improvements in both knee and shoulder arthroscopic surgery skills. Clinical Relevance: The current study adds to mounting evidence supporting virtual arthroscopic simulator-based training for orthopaedic residents. Most significantly, this study also provides a baseline for evidence-based targeted use of arthroscopic simulators based on resident training level.

Virtual reality mobile application to improve videoscopic airway training: A randomised trial,"Yau, Y. W.; Li, Z.; Chua, M. T.; Kuan, W. S.; Chan, G. W. H.","INTRODUCTION: Flexible bronchoscopic intubation (FBI) is an important technique in managing an anticipated difficult airway, yet it is rarely performed and has a steep learning curve. We aim to evaluate if the integration of virtual reality gaming application into routine FBI training for emergency department doctors would be more effective than traditional teaching methods. METHOD(S): We conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare self-directed learning using the mobile application, Airway Ex* in the intervention group versus the control group without use of the mobile application. All participants underwent conventional didactic teaching and low-fidelity simulation with trainer's demonstration and hands-on practice on a manikin for FBI. Participants randomised to the intervention arm received an additional 30 minutes of self-directed learning using Airway Ex, preloaded on electronic devices while the control arm did not. The primary outcome was time taken to successful intubation. RESULT(S): Forty-five physicians (20 junior and 25 senior physicians) were enrolled, with male predominance (57.8%, 26/45). There was no difference in time taken to successful intubation (median 48 seconds [interquartile range, IQR 41-69] versus 44 seconds [IQR 37-60], P=0.23) between the control and intervention groups, respectively. However, the intervention group received better ratings (median 4 [IQR 4-5]) for the quality of scope manipulation skills compared to control (median 4 [IQR 3-4], adjusted P=0.03). This difference remains significant among junior physicians in stratified analysis. CONCLUSION(S): Incorporating virtual reality with traditional teaching methods allows learners to be trained on FBI safely without compromising patient care.

A fast and stable vascular deformation scheme for interventional surgery training system,"Ye, X.; Zhang, J.; Li, P.; Wang, T.; Guo, S.","Background: The emergence and development of robot assistant interventional vascular surgery technologies have benefited many patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the absence of effective training measures, these new advanced technologies have not been fully utilized and only few experienced surgeons can perform such complicated surgeries so far. In order to solve such problems, virtual reality based vascular interventional surgery training system, a promising way to train young surgeons or assist experienced surgeons to perform surgery, has been widely studied. Method(s): In this paper, we mainly conduct a thorough study on both reliable deformation and high real-time performance of an interactive surgery training system. An efficient hybrid geometric blood vessel model which handles the collision detection query and vascular deformation calculation separately is employed to enhance the real-time performance of our surgery training system. In addition, a position-based dynamic approach with volume conservation constraint is used to improve the vascular deformation result. Finally, a hash table based spatial adaptive acceleration algorithm which makes the training system much more efficient and reliable is described. Result(s): Several necessary experiments are conducted to validate the vascular deformation scheme presented in this paper. From the results we can see that the position-based dynamic modeling method with volume conservation constraint can prevent the vascular deformation from the issue of penetration. In addition, the deformation calculation with spatial acceleration algorithm has enhanced the real-time performance significantly. Conclusion(s): The corresponding experimental results indicate that both the hybrid geometric blood vessel model and the hash table based spatial adaptive acceleration algorithm can enhance the performance of our surgery training system greatly without losing the deformation accuracy.

Virtual Reality Skills Training Trends in Nurse Practitioner Education. [Chinese],"Yeh, H. F.","Technology developments change education strategies. Incorporating virtual reality into lesson plans allows education to focus not only on learning knowledge but also on knowledge and skills integration. In simulation education, learning environments are designed to approximate actual clinical situations, allowing students to practice skills in virtual clinical situations continuously. In addition, clinical lecturers may observe the students' practice process and provide feedback. Furthermore, through experiencing and practicing clinical procedures, students gain critical clinical judgment, skills, and teamwork operation competences, which may be applied in the real world. In Taiwan, the majority of nurse practitioner training is implemented in hospitals, and clinical training is done using hands-on and face-to-face teaching strategies within a mentorship framework. Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this hospital-based training model has been significantly challenged. However, this represents an opportunity to migrate the nurse practitioner training model toward technology-based simulation education. Developing more virtual-reality-based lesson plans centered on clinical situations may help students complete training that is normally conducted in hospital teaching environments. Through repetitive practice in virtual reality settings, students may obtain comprehensive knowledge and clinical skills that will help relieve the subsequent stress of clinical practicum work and promote care quality and patient safety.",2021,1-Oct,Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,68(5),,13-17,636203264,,,#5563,Yeh 2021,,
"""Take-home"" box trainers are an effective alternative to virtual reality simulators","Yiasemidou, M.; de Siqueira, J.; Tomlinson, J.; Glassman, D.; Stock, S.; Gough, M.","Background Practice on virtual reality simulators (VRSs) has been shown to improve surgical performance. However, VRSs are expensive and usually housed in surgical skills centers that may be inaccessible at times convenient for surgical trainees to practice. Conversely, box trainers (BT) are inexpensive and can be used anywhere at anytime. This study assesses ""take-home"" BTs as an alternative to VRS. Methods After baseline assessments (two simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomies, one on a VRS and one on a BT), 25 surgical trainees were randomized to two groups. Trainees were asked to practice three basic laparoscopic tasks for 6 wk (BT group using a ""take-home"" box trainer; VR group using VRS in clinical skills centers). After the practice period, all performed two laparoscopic cholecystectomy, one on a VRS and one on a BT; (i.e., posttraining assessment). VRS provided metrics (total time [TT], number of movements instrument tip path length), and expert video assessment of cholecystectomy in a BT (Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills [GOALS] score) were recorded. Performance during pretraining and posttraining assessment was compared. Results The BT group showed a significant improvement for all VRS metrics (P = 0.008) and the efficiency category of GOALS score (P = 0.03). Only TT improved in the VRS group, and none of the GOALS categories demonstrated a statistically significant improvement after training. Finally, the improvement in VRS metrics in the BT group was significantly greater than in the VR group (TT P = 0.005, number of movements P = 0.042, path length P = 0.031), although there were no differences in the GOALS scores between the groups. Conclusions This study suggests that a basic ""take-home"" BT is a suitable alternative to VRS.

Remote virtual reality teaching: Closing an educational gap during a global pandemic,"Young, D.; Real, F. J.; Sahay, R. D.; Zackoff, M.","OBJECTIVE: Resident physicians are expected to recognize patients requiring escalation of care on day 1 of residency, as outlined by the Association of American Medical Colleges. Opportunities for medical students to assess patients at the bedside or through traditional simulation-based medical education have decreased because of coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions. Virtual reality (VR) delivered remotely via video teleconferencing may address this educational gap. METHOD(S): A prospective pilot study targeting third-year pediatric clerkship students at a large academic children's hospital was conducted from April to December 2020. Groups of 6 to 15 students participated in a 1.5-hour video teleconferencing session with a physician facilitator donning a VR headset and screen sharing interactive VR cases of a hospitalized infant with respiratory distress. Students completed surveys assessing the immersion and tolerability of the virtual experience and reported its perceived effectiveness to traditional educational modalities. Comparisons were analyzed with binomial testing. RESULT(S): Participants included third-year medical students on their pediatric clerkship. A total of 140 students participated in the sessions, with 63% completing the survey. A majority of students reported VR captured their attention (78%) with minimal side effects. Students reported remote VR training as more effective (P < .001) than reading and online learning and equally or more effective (P < .001) than didactic teaching. Most students (80%) rated remote VR as less effective than bedside teaching. CONCLUSION(S): This pilot reveals the feasibility of remote group clinical training with VR via a video conferencing platform, addressing a key experience gap while navigating coronavirus disease 2019 limitations on training.

Investigating the Effect of Simulator Functional Fidelity and Personalized Feedback on Central Venous Catheterization Training,"Yovanoff, M. A.; Chen, H. E.; Pepley, D. F.; Mirkin, K. A.; Han, D. C.; Moore, J. Z.; Miller, S. R.","Objective: To compare the effect of simulator functional fidelity (manikin vs a Dynamic Haptic Robotic Trainer [DHRT]) and personalized feedback on surgical resident self-efficacy and self-ratings of performance during ultrasound-guided internal jugular central venous catheterization (IJ CVC) training. In addition, we seek to explore how self-ratings of performance compare to objective performance scores generated by the DHRT system. Design(s): Participants were randomly assigned to either manikin or DHRT IJ CVC training over a 6-month period. Self-efficacy surveys were distributed before and following training. Training consisted of a pretest, 22 practice IJ CVC needle insertion attempts, 2 full-line practice attempts, and a posttest. Participants provided self-ratings of performance for each needle insertion and were presented with feedback from either an upper level resident (manikin) or a personalized learning system (DHRT). Setting(s): A study was conducted from July 2016 to February 2017 through a surgical skills training program at Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Participant(s): Twenty-six first-year surgical residents were recruited for the study. Individuals were informed that IJ CVC training procedures would be consistent regardless of participation in the study and that participation was optional. All recruited residents opted to participate in the study. Result(s): Residents in both groups significantly improved their self-efficacy scores from pretest to posttest (p < 0.01). Residents in the manikin group consistently provided higher self-ratings of performance (p < 0.001). Residents in the DHRT group recorded more feedback on errors (228 instances) than the manikin group (144 instances). Self-ratings of performance on the DHRT system were able to significantly predict the objective score of the DHRT system (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.223, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Simulation training with the DHRT system and the personalized learning feedback can improve resident self-efficacy with IJ CVC procedures and provide sufficient feedback to allow residents to accurately assess their own performance.

Mixed Reality-Based Preoperative Planning for Training of Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy: A Feasibility Study,"Yu, H.; Zhou, Z.; Lei, X.; Liu, H.; Fan, G.; He, S.","Objective: To explore the effect of preoperative planning using mixed reality (MR) on training of percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). Method(s): Before the training, we invited an experienced chief physician to plan the puncture path of PTED on the X-ray films of the lumbar spine model and the 3D Slicer platform, respectively, and used this as the standard to guide trainees. In the aggregate, 60 young residents were randomly divided into Group A (N = 30) and Group B (N = 30). Group A learned the 2-dimensional standard planning route, whereas Group B learned the standard route planning based on MR through the 3D Slicer platform. Then, trainees were asked to conduct PTED puncture on a lumbar spine model. Questionnaires were distributed to trainees before and after the training. During the training, puncture times, operating time (minutes), and fluoroscopy times were recorded. Result(s): After the training, it was obvious that more trainees showed their recognition of MR, believing that MR could help preoperative planning and training of PTED. Their high satisfaction with the training indicated the success of our training. Moreover, puncture times, operating time (minutes), and fluoroscopy times of Group B were significantly lower than those of Group A. Conclusion(s): MR technology contributes to preoperative planning of PTED and is beneficial in the training of PTED. It significantly reduces puncture times and fluoroscopy times, providing a standardized method for the training of PTED.

Effects of Virtual Reality Simulation Program Regarding High-risk Neonatal Infection Control on Nursing Students,"Yu, M.; Yang, M.; Ku, B.; Mann, J. S.","Purpose: Virtual reality simulation can give nursing students a safe clinical experience involving high-risk infants where access to neonatal intensive care units is limited. This study aimed to examine the effects of a virtual reality simulation program on Korean nursing students' knowledge, performance self-efficacy and learner satisfaction. Method(s): A nonequivalent control group design was applied. Senior nursing students were divided into an experimental group (n = 25) experiencing virtual reality simulation and routine neonatal intensive care unit practice and a control group (n = 25) having routine neonatal intensive care unit practice. The program consisted of three scenarios: basic care, feeding management and skin care and environmental management for prevention of neonatal infection. The total execution time for the three scenarios was 40 minutes. The simulation created immersive virtual reality experiences using a head-mounted display with hand-tracking technology. Data were collected from December 9, 2019, to January 17, 2020, and were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the t-test, paired t-tests, Mann-Whitney test and Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. Result(s): Compared to the control group, the experimental group showed significantly greater improvements in high-risk neonatal infection control performance self-efficacy (t = -2.16, p = .018) and learner satisfaction (t = -5.59, p < .001).

Quantitative influence and performance analysis of virtual reality laparoscopic surgical training system,"Yu, P.; Pan, J.; Wang, Z.; Shen, Y.; Li, J.; Hao, A.; Wang, H.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) surgery training has become a trend in clinical education. Many research papers validate the effectiveness of VR-based surgical simulators in training medical students. However, most existing articles employ subjective methods to study the residents' surgical skills improvement. Few of them investigate how to improve the surgery skills on specific dimensions substantially. METHOD(S): Our paper resorts to physiological approaches to objectively study the quantitative influence and performance analysis of VR laparoscopic surgical training system for medical students. Fifty-one participants were recruited from a pool of medical students. They conducted four pre and post experiments in the training box. They were trained on VR-based laparoscopic surgery simulators (VRLS) in the middle of pre and post experiments. Their operation and physiological data (heart rate and electroencephalogram) are recorded during the pre and post experiments. The physiological data is used to compute cognitive load and flow experience quantitatively. Senior surgeons graded their performance using newly designed hybrid standards for fundamental tasks and Global operative assessment of laparoscopic skills (GOALS) standards for colon resection tasks. Finally, the participants were required to fill the questionnaires about their cognitive load and flow experience. RESULT(S): After training on VRLS, the time of the experimental group to complete the same task could drop sharply (p < 0.01). The performance scores are enhanced significantly (p < 0.01). The performance and cognitive load computed from EEG are negatively correlated (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): The results show that the VRLS could highly improve medical students' performance and enable the participants to obtain flow experience with a lower cognitive load. Participants' performance is negatively correlated with cognitive load through quantitative physiological analysis. This might provide a new way of assessing skill acquirement. Copyright © 2022.

Impact of an Immersive Virtual Reality Curriculum on Medical Students' Clinical Assessment of Infants with Respiratory Distress,"Zackoff, M. W.; Real, F. J.; Sahay, R. D.; Fei, L.; Guiot, A.; Lehmann, C.; Tegtmeyer, K.; Klein, M.","Objective: To determine whether exposure to an immersive virtual reality curriculum on pediatric respiratory distress improves medical students' recognition of impending respiratory failure. Design(s): Randomized, controlled, prospective study conducted from July 2017 to June 2018. Evaluators blinded to student groupings. Setting(s): Academic, free-standing children's hospital. Participant(s): All third-year medical students (n = 168) were eligible. The standard curriculum was delivered to all students during their pediatric rotation with optional inclusion of research data per Institutional Review Board review. A randomized selection of students was exposed to the virtual reality curriculum. Intervention(s): All students received standard training on respiratory distress through didactics and high-fidelity mannequin simulation. Intervention students underwent an additional 30-minute immersive virtual reality curriculum, experienced through an OculusRift headset, with three simulations of an infant with 1) no distress, 2) respiratory distress, and 3) impending respiratory failure. Measurements and Main Results: The impact of the virtual reality curriculum on recognition/interpretation of key examination findings, assignment of an appropriate respiratory status assessment, and recognition of the need for escalation of care for patients in impending respiratory failure was assessed via a free response clinical assessment of video vignettes at the end of the pediatric rotation. Responses were scored on standardized rubrics by physician experts. All eligible students participated (78 intervention and 90 control). Significant differences between intervention and control were demonstrated for consideration/interpretation of mental status (p < 0.01), assignment of the appropriate respiratory status assessment (p < 0.01), and recognition of a need for escalation of care (p = 0.0004). Conclusion(s): Exposure to an immersive virtual reality curriculum led to improvement in objective competence at the assessment of respiratory distress and recognition of the need for escalation of care for patients with signs of impending respiratory failure.

Establishing Objective Measures of Clinical Competence in Undergraduate Medical Education Through Immersive Virtual Reality,"Zackoff, M. W.; Young, D.; Sahay, R. D.; Fei, L.; Real, F. J.; Guiot, A.; Lehmann, C.; Klein, M.","Objective: The Association of American Medical Colleges defines recognition of the need for urgent or emergent escalation of care as a key Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) for entering residency (EPA#10). This study pilots the use of an immersive virtual reality (VR) platform for defining objective observable behaviors as standards for evaluation of medical student recognition of impending respiratory failure. Method(s): A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from July 2018 to December 2019, evaluating student performance during a VR scenario of an infant in impending respiratory failure using the OculusRift VR platform. Video recordings were rated by 2 pair of physician reviewers blinded to student identity. One pair provided a consensus global assessment of performance (not competent, borderline, or competent) while the other used a checklist of observable behaviors to rate performance. Binary discriminant analysis was used to identify the observable behaviors that predicted the global assessment rating. Result(s): Twenty-six fourth year medical students participated. Student performance of 8 observable behaviors was found to be most predictive of a rating of competent, with a 91% probability. Correctly stating that the patient required an escalation of care had the largest contribution toward predicting a rating of competent, followed by commenting on the patient's increased heart rate, low oxygen saturation, increased respiratory rate, and stating that the patient was in respiratory distress. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that VR can be used to establish objective and observable performance standards for assessment of EPA attainment - a key step in moving towards competency based medical education.

What is the Current State of Extended Reality Use in Otolaryngology Training? A Scoping Review,"Zagury-Orly, I.; Solinski, M. A.; Nguyen, L. H. P.; Young, M.; Drozdowski, V.; Bain, P. A.; Gantwerker, E. A.","Objective: To map current literature on the educational use of extended reality (XR) in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) to inform teaching and research. Study Design: Scoping Review. Method(s): A scoping review was conducted, identifying literature through MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Web of Science databases. Findings were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping review checklist. Studies were included if they involved OHNS trainees or medical students who used XR for an educational purpose in OHNS. XR was defined as: fully-immersive virtual reality (VR) using head-mounted displays (HMDs), non-immersive and semi-immersive VR, augmented reality (AR), or mixed reality (MR). Data on device use were extracted, and educational outcomes were analyzed according to Kirkpatrick's evaluation framework. Result(s): Of the 1,434 unique abstracts identified, 40 articles were included. All articles reported on VR; none discussed AR or MR. Twenty-nine articles were categorized as semi-immersive, none used occlusive HMDs therefore, none met modern definitions of immersive VR. Most studies (29 of 40) targeted temporal bone surgery. Using the Kirkpatrick four-level evaluation model, all studies were limited to level-1 (learner reaction) or level-2 (knowledge or skill performance). Conclusion(s): Current educational applications of XR in OHNS are limited to VR, do not fully immerse participants and do not assess higher-level learning outcomes. The educational OHNS community would benefit from a shared definition for VR technology, assessment of skills transfer (level-3 and higher), and deliberate testing of AR, MR, and procedures beyond temporal bone surgery.

Design and evaluation of a portable laparoscopic training system using virtual reality,"Zahiri, M.; Booton, R.; Siu, K. C.; Nelson, C. A.","The ubiquitous nature of laparoscopic surgery and the decreased training time available for surgeons are driving an increased need for effective training systems to help surgeons learn different procedures. A cost-effective and user-friendly simulator has been designed to imitate specific training tasks for laparoscopic surgery in virtual environments via image processing and computer vision. The capability of using various actual surgical instruments suited for these specific procedures gives heightened fidelity to the simulator. Image processing via MATLAB software provides real-time mapping of the graspers in the workspace to the virtual reality (VR) environment (VIZARD software). Two different tasks (peg transfer and needle passing) were designed to evaluate trainees and compare their performance with characteristics of expert surgeons. Pilot testing of the system was carried out with 11 subjects to validate the similarity of this device with an existing surgical box trainer. Task completion time and muscle activity have been used as metrics for evaluation. The decrease in completion time for all subjects suggests similarity of skills transfer for both simulators. In addition, the p-value of muscle activity showed no significant differences for most muscles in the peg transfer task when using either the VR or physical analog environment and no significant differences for about half of the muscles in the needle passing task. Based on the results, the new proposed VR simulator appears to be a viable alternative to help trainees gain laparoscopic skills.

Evaluation of Augmented Reality Feedback in Surgical Training Environment,"Zahiri, M.; Nelson, C. A.; Oleynikov, D.; Siu, K. C.","Providing computer-based laparoscopic surgical training has several advantages that enhance the training process. Self-evaluation and real-time performance feedback are 2 of these advantages, which avoid dependency of trainees on expert feedback. The goal of this study was to investigate the use of a visual time indicator as real-time feedback correlated with the laparoscopic surgical training. Twenty novices participated in this study working with (and without) different presentations of time indicators. They performed a standard peg transfer task, and their completion times and muscle activity were recorded and compared. Also of interest was whether the use of this type of feedback induced any side effect in terms of motivation or muscle fatigue. Results. Of the 20 participants, 15 (75%) preferred using a time indicator in the training process rather than having no feedback. However, time to task completion showed no significant difference in performance with the time indicator; furthermore, no significant differences in muscle activity or muscle fatigue were detected with/without time feedback. Conclusion. The absence of significant difference between task performance with/without time feedback shows that using visual real-time feedback can be included in surgical training based on user preference. Trainees may benefit from this type of feedback in the form of increased motivation. The extent to which this can influence training frequency leading to performance improvement is a question for further study.

B.","Objectives: Applying technologies such as virtual reality (VR) in education has gained popularity especially in comprehending abstract and subjective phenomena. Previous studies have shown that applying a virtual reality simulation of psychosis (VRSP) is useful in increasing knowledge and empathy toward patients. Here, the efficacy of using VRSP in altering stigma, empathy and knowledge as well as side effects have been assessed in medical students in comparison with the routine education (visiting the patients). Method(s): After attending one session of lecture about positive psychotic symptoms, medical students were allocated to two groups: experiencing one session of VRSP or visiting patients under supervision as routine practice in the ward. Before and after the first session and after the second one, questionnaires of knowledge, empathy and stigma were filled by students. Finally, the results were compared in two groups. Result(s): Both interventions were effective in reducing stigma as well as increasing knowledge and empathy toward patients with psychotic experiences. VRSP could significantly reduce stigma and increase knowledge and empathy compared with the traditional visiting patients under supervision. The side effects were minimal and ameliorated right after the experience.

Development and implementation of methods for training doctors and dental surgeons using virtual devices and simulation,"Zechowicz, M.; Gromadzinski, L.; Dudzinski, L.; Grabarczyk, L.; Zechowicz, T.; Zablocki, M.; Zaborowski, P.","Introduction: Simulation is increasingly incorporated in medical education to learn and develop cognitive, psychomotor and behavioural skills at the individual level and in teamwork. An advanced medical simulator SimMan 3G and an e-learning platform were created to develop a new approach towards doctors' training. Aim(s): A programme for the development and implementation of training methods for doctors and dental surgeons was created, as exemplified by the Simulation Centre of University Hospital in Olsztyn. Material(s) and Method(s): The leading component of the project is the SimMan simulation device, along with specially designed rooms for simulation, debriefing and supervision of the training process. The most distinguishing feature of the entire training programme is a specially designed platform for education and training: www.symulatorymed. pl, consisting of knowledge bases, case reports, training scenarios, and tests ultimately compatible and cooperating with the aforementioned medical simulator. Results and discussion: Importance of medical simulation has been proven in terms of preservation of knowledge and skills for much longer than did previous training methods. The newly designed e-learning platform gives the opportunity to create specialized databases and check the results of on-simulator training sessions, which serve as 'feedback' to all the information provided on-line. This allows for multi-dimensional comparison of the progress and effectiveness of teaching during the successive testing sessions. Conclusion(s): The main goal of the newly created simulation infrastructure is to transfer better results of education from the conditions of the simulation room into reality, in order to improve the survival and effectiveness of treatment of patients.

Effect of virtual reality simulation training on the response capability of public health emergency reserve nurses in China: A quasiexperimental study,"Zhang, D.; Liao, H.; Jia, Y.; He, P.; Wang, D.; Chen, Y.; Yang, W.; Zhang, Y. P.","Objective To develop a virtual reality simulation training programme, and further verify the effect of the programme on improving the response capacity of emergency reserve nurses confronting public health emergencies. Design A prospective quasiexperimental design with a control group. Participants A total of 120 nurses were recruited and randomly divided into the control group and the intervention group. Intervention Participants underwent a 3-month training. The control group received the conventional training of emergency response (eg, theoretical lectures, technical skills and psychological training), while the intervention group underwent the virtual reality simulation training in combination with skills training. The COVID-19 cases were incorporated into the intervention group training, and the psychological training was identical to both groups. At the end of the training, each group conducted emergency drills twice. Before and after the intervention, the two groups were assessed for the knowledge and technical skills regarding responses to fulminate respiratory infectious diseases, as well as the capacity of emergency care. Furthermore, their pandemic preparedness was assessed with a disaster preparedness questionnaire. Results After the intervention, the scores of the relevant knowledge, the capacity of emergency care and disaster preparedness in the intervention group significantly increased (p<0.01). The score of technical skills in the control group increased more significantly than that of the intervention group (p<0.01). No significant difference was identified in the scores of postdisaster management in two groups (p>0.05). Conclusion The virtual reality simulation training in combination with technical skills training can improve the response capacity of emergency reserve nurses as compared with the conventional training. The findings of the study provide some evidence for the emergency training of reserve nurses in better response to public health emergencies and suggest this methodology is worthy of further research and popularisation.

Virtual reality simulation in training endoscopic skills: A systematic review,"Zhang, W.; Liu, X.; Zheng, B.","Objective: Training young physicians in gastrointestinal endoscopy through virtual reality (VR) simulators has become popular. It is important to evaluate the benefits and usefulness of this technology for teaching endoscopic skills. The objective of this literature review is to understand the benefits of VR technology through quantitative and qualitative examination of learning outcomes. Method(s): A literature search of 7 databases was conducted. Studies which compared the effects of learning through VR simulation and another method of learning were included. In addition, studies were included if they evaluated learning outcomes on clinical patients. Participants could be medical residents, fellows, physicians, or nurses. Common outcomes measured across studies included subjective overall performance scores, total procedure times, rate of successful procedure completion, error rates, patient pain or discomfort, and measures of independence. Result(s): A total of 22 studies were included. Overall, VR simulation training was seen to be comparable or significantly better than clinical training, no training, other types of simulation, and another form of VR training. Many authors reported increasing patient safety, reducing stress and time constraints, and shortening the learning curve as advantages of VR simulation training. However, this form of training is also expensive and may result in the learning of bad habits. Conclusion(s): VR simulation technology can be a valuable form of educating endoscopy novices if properly supervised during training, and if there is also integration of clinical training.

A Pilot Study to Investigate the Role of Virtual Reality in the Preservice Training of Nursing Staff in Isolation Wards,"Zhang, W.; Luo, M.; Liu, Y.; Cai, S.; Yang, Q.; Huang, Y.; Yu, X.","Healthcare providers without working experience in isolation wards experience enormous challenges. Traditional ward orientation is constrained by space, time, and even infection risk in particular periods (eg, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic). Virtual reality has been used widely, but rarely in wards. This study aimed to explore the experience of utilizing virtual reality for isolation ward training among nurses. In this study, nurses completed virtual reality training via an online platform and were then trained in isolation wards, after which their perceptions were explored by questionnaire and interviews. A total of 1868 participants completed the training. Most participants thought the preservice training was important and believed the virtual reality experience was consistent with the in-person training. Virtual reality was found not only to be convenient and valuable for training but also to have the benefits of occupational protection. However, whereas 50.48% of participants wanted to learn the ward via virtual reality, 87.21% of participants wanted to learn via in-person training before working in the wards. As a substitute for in-person training, virtual reality is a feasible and practical instrument to provide preservice training in particular periods. However, there is room for improvement due to general discomfort and technological problems. Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The effectiveness of virtual reality-based technology on anatomy teaching: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies,"Zhao, J.; Xu, X.; Jiang, H.; Ding, Y.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is an innovation that permits the individual to discover and operate within three-dimensional (3D) environment to gain practical understanding. This research aimed to examine the general efficiency of VR for teaching medical anatomy. METHOD(S): We executed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies of the performance of VR anatomy education. We browsed five databases from the year 1990 to 2019. Ultimately, 15 randomized controlled trials with a teaching outcome measure analysis were included. Two authors separately chose studies, extracted information, and examined the risk of bias. The primary outcomes were examination scores of the students. Secondary outcomes were the degrees of satisfaction of the students. Random-effects models were used for the pooled evaluations of scores and satisfaction degrees. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was applied to assess the systematic results. The heterogeneity was determined by I2 statistics, and then was investigated by meta-regression and subgroup analyses. RESULT(S): In this review, we screened and included fifteen randomized controlled researches (816 students). The pooled analysis of primary outcomes showed that VR improves test scores moderately compared with other approaches (standardized mean difference [SMD]=0.53; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.09-0.97, p<0.05; I2 =87.8%). The high homogeneity indicated that the studies were different from each other. Therefore, we carried out meta-regression as well as subgroup analyses using seven variables (year, country, learners, course, intervention, comparator, and duration). We found that VR improves post-intervention test score of anatomy compared with other types of teaching methods. CONCLUSION(S): The finding confirms that VR may act as an efficient way to improve the learners' level of anatomy knowledge. Future research should assess other factors like degree of satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, and adverse reactions when evaluating the teaching effectiveness of VR in anatomy.",2020,25-Apr,BMC medical education,20(1),,127,631637730,,,#5693,Zhao 2020,,

Efficacy of virtual reality techniques in cardiopulmonary resuscitation training: Protocol for a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and trial sequential analysis,"Zheng, J.; Du, L.; Deng, X.; Zhang, L.; Wang, J.; Chen, G.","Introduction Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the most critical procedure in the rescue of patients with sudden cardiac death (SCD). The success rate of CPR remains far below expectations, which made CPR education identified as the top priority for SCD. CPR training using the virtual reality (VR) technique is a feasible training method, with a wider population and lower cost, but its efficacy remains controversial. Thus, we will perform a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the efficacy of the VR technique on CPR quality. Methods and analysis We will search PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese BioMedical Literature, Wanfang and VIP databases from inception to November 2021, to identify randomised controlled trials and the first period in randomised cross-over trials assessing the efficacy of VR techniques versus non-VR techniques for adult participants accepting adult CPR training. No language restrictions will be considered. Data synthesis will be performed using RevMan V.5.4 and Stata/MP V.16.0. Outcome measures will be present as relative risk with 95% CIs for dichotomous data and mean difference with 95% CIs for continuous data. The primary outcome will be the CPR quality defined as chest compression rate and depth. Secondary outcomes will be the overall performance of CPR. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the chi 2 test and I 2 statistic. Data will be synthesised by either fixed-effects or random-effects models according to the I 2 value. Trial sequential analysis and modified Jadad Scale will be used to control the risks of random errors and evaluate the evidence quality. Egger's regression test and funnel plots will be used to assess the publication bias. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was not required for this systematic review protocol.

Online virtual cases to teach resource stewardship,"Zhou, L. L.; Tait, G.; Sandhu, S.; Steiman, A.; Lake, S.","BACKGROUND: As health care costs rise, medical education must focus on high-value clinical decision making. To teach and assess efficient resource use in rheumatology, online virtual interactive cases (VICs) were developed to simulate real patient encounters to increase price transparency and reinforce cost consciousness. To teach and assess efficient resource use in rheumatology, online virtual interactive cases (VICs) were developed METHODS: The VIC modules were distributed to a sample of medical students and internal medicine residents, who were required to assess patients, order appropriate investigations, develop differential diagnoses and formulate management plans. Each action was associated with a time and price, with the totals compared against ideals. Trainees were evaluated not only on their diagnosis and patient management, but also on the total time, cost and value of their selected workup. Trainee responses were tracked anonymously, with opportunity to provide feedback at the end of each case. RESULT(S): Seventeen medical trainees completed a total of 48 VIC modules. On average, trainees spent CAN $227.52 and 68 virtual minutes on each case, which was lower than expected. This may have been the result of a low management score of 52.4%, although on average 92.0% of participants in each case achieved the correct diagnosis. In addition, 85.7% felt more comfortable working up similar cases, and 57.1% believed that the modules increased their ability to appropriately order cost-conscious rheumatology investigations. DISCUSSION: Our initial assessment of the VIC rheumatology modules was positive, supporting their role as an effective tool in teaching an approach to rheumatology patients, with an emphasis on resource stewardship. Future directions include the expansion of cases, based on feedback, wider dissemination and an evaluation of learning retention.

VR/AR Technology in Human Anatomy Teaching and Operation Training,"Zhou, Y.; Hou, J.; Liu, Q.; Chao, X.; Wang, N.; Chen, Y.; Guan, J.; Zhang, Q.; Diwu, Y.","AR/VR technology can fuse the clinical imaging data and information to build an anatomical environment combining virtual and real, which is helpful to improve the interest of teaching and the learning initiative of medical students, and then improve the effect of clinical teaching. This paper studies the application and learning effect of the VR/AR system in human anatomy surgery teaching. This paper first shows the learning environment and platform of the VR/AR system, then explains the interface and operation of the system, and evaluates the teaching situation. This paper takes the VR/AR operation simulation system of an Irish company as an example and evaluates the learning effect of 41 students in our hospital. Research shows that the introduction of the feature reweighting module in the VR/AR surgery simulation system improves the accuracy of bone structure segmentation (IOU value increases from 79.62% to 83.56%). For real human ultrasound image data, the IOU value increases from 80.21% to 82.23% after the feature reweighting module is introduced. Therefore, the dense convolution module and feature reweighting module improve the learning ability of the network for bone structure features in ultrasound images from two aspects of feature connection and importance understanding and effectively improve the performance of bone structure segmentation.

Personalized virtual reality simulation training system for percutaneous needle insertion and comparison of zSpace and vive,"Zhou, Z.; Yang, Z.; Jiang, S.; Jiang, B.; Xu, B.; Zhu, T.; Ma, S.","Purpose: In this research, we present a personalized simulation training system for percutaneous needle insertion based on virtual reality (VR). Within this system, surgeons can become more familiar with real surgical procedures, thereby reducing errors that may occur in real surgery. Additionally, different VR technologies, i.e., zSpace and Vive, were compared to provide surgeons with a better surgical training environment. Method(s): and Methods A VR system combined with the treatment planning system was developed to create personalized patient training environment. An evaluation study recruiting twenty novices was performed to demonstrate the system. Each participant performed six independent needle placements using the VR system. Placement time was recorded. Placement error was defined as the distance from the needle tip to the target center. The participants completed a seven-point Likert scale questionnaire after the simulation. Result(s): Compared with Vive, using zspace reduces the placement time (from 90.32 s to 68.94 s). The placement error using zSpace and Vive was similar (1.27 +/- 0.68 mm, 1.56 +/- 0.81 mm, respectively). The questionnaire survey results show that most participants are highly satisfied with the training effect of the VR system. Participants prefer the operation mode and convenience of zSpace but think that the immersion of Vive is better. Conclusion(s): The personalized virtual reality surgical training system was effective as a training system for percutaneous needle insertion. The system based on zSpace had a shorter placement time while maintaining placement accuracy compared to the system based on Vive. The system based on zSpace achieved higher satisfaction in most aspects except for immersion.

Influence of practical and clinical experience on dexterity performance measured using a Haptic Virtual Reality simulator,"Ziane-Casenave, S.; Mauroux, M.; Devillard, R.; Kerouredan, O.","INTRODUCTION: Development of dexterity, hand-eye coordination and self-assessment are essential during the preclinical training of dental students. To meet this requirement, dental simulators have been developed combining virtual reality with a force feedback haptic interface. The aim of this study was to assess the capability of the VirTeaSy© haptic simulator to discriminate between users with different levels of practical and clinical experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six volunteers divided into five groups (non-dentists, 1st / 3rd / final-year dental students, recent graduates) had three attempts to prepare an occlusal amalgam cavity using the simulator. Percentages of volumes prepared inside (%IV) and outside (%OV) the required cavity, skill index and progression rate, referring to the evolution of skill index between trial 1 and 3, were assessed. The dental students and recent graduates completed a questionnaire to gather their opinions about their first hands-on experience with a haptic simulator. RESULT(S): The results showed no significant difference between the groups at the first attempt. Following the third attempt, the skill index was improved significantly. Analysis of progression rates, characterized by large standard deviations, did not reveal significant differences between groups. The third attempt showed significant differences in skill index and %IV between 1st -year undergraduate dental students and both non-dentists and recent dental graduates. The questionnaire indicated a tendency for dental operators to consider the simulator as a complement to their learning and not a substitute for traditional methods. CONCLUSION(S): This study did not show the ability of a basic aptitude test on VirTeaSy© haptic simulator to discriminate between users of different levels of expertise. Optimizations must be considered in order to make simulation-based assessment clinically relevant. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

An immersive educational tool for dental implant placement: A study on user acceptance,"Zorzal, E. R.; Paulo, S. F.; Rodrigues, P.; Mendes, J. J.; Lopes, D. S.","Background: Tools for training and education of dental students can improve their ability to perform technical procedures such as dental implant placement. Shortage of training can negatively affect dental implantologists' performance during intraoperative procedures, resulting in lack of surgical precision and, consequently, inadequate implant placement, which may lead to unsuccessful implant supported restorations or other complications. Objective(s): We designed and developed IMMPLANT a virtual reality educational tool to assist implant placement learning, which allows users to freely manipulate 3D dental models (e.g., a simulated patient's mandible and implant) with their dominant hand while operating a touchscreen device to assist 3D manipulation. Method(s): The proposed virtual reality tool combines an immersive head-mounted display, a small hand tracking device and a smartphone that are all connected to a laptop. The operator's dominant hand is tracked to quickly and coarsely manipulate either the 3D dental model or the virtual implant, while the non-dominant hand holds a smartphone converted into a controller to assist button activation and a greater input precision for 3D implant positioning and inclination. We evaluated IMMPLANT's usability and acceptance during training sessions with 16 dental professionals. Result(s): The conducted user acceptance study revealed that IMMPLANT constitutes a versatile, portable, and complementary tool to assist implant placement learning, as it promotes immersive visualization and spatial manipulation of 3D dental anatomy. Conclusion(s): IMMPLANT is a promising virtual reality tool to assist student learning and 3D dental visualization for implant placement education. IMMPLANT may also be easily incorporated into training programs for dental students.

A significant correlation was observed between the MRT score and simulator score only in ""Suture Sponge 1"" over the first 3 attempts (first: r = 0.584, p = 0.0054; second: r = 0.443, p = 0.0443; third: r = 0.4458, p = 0.0428). After the third attempt, this significant correlation was lost. Comparison of the score for ""Suture Sponge 1"" between the high-MRT and low-MRT scoring participants divided by a median MRT score of 26 also showed a significant difference in the score until the third trial.CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that the spatial cognitive ability influences the initial learning of robotic suturing skills. Further studies are necessary to verify the usefulness of an individual's spatial ability to tailor the surgical training program.",2018,,Journal of Surgical Education,75,2,458-464,28918007,,,#5773,Abe 2018,,
Virtual Reality vs. High-Fidelity Mannequin-Based Simulation: A Pilot Randomized Trial Evaluating Learner Performance,"Abulfaraj, M. M.; Jeffers, J. M.; Tackett, S.; Chang, T.","Background Virtual Reality (VR) simulation has been found to be useful in learning technical and non-technical skills. However, empirical data about its efficacy in clinical education are limited. This pilot study compares the efficacy of VR to mannequin-based simulation for learners managing status epilepticus (SE). Methods Pediatric and emergency medicine interns at an academic tertiary care referral center were randomized to either VR (intervention, using an Oculus Rift<sup> R</sup> (Occulus from Facebook, Facebook Inc., USA)) or mannequin-based (control) simulation for the same SE scenario. The control group participated in two mannequin-based simulation sessions while the intervention group had a VR session followed by a mannequin-based session. Sessions were one-one with an instructor and held three months apart. Performance was assessed by measuring the time-to-critical actions during the second session. Results Of 42 interns, 22 were in the intervention group and 20 in the control group. There was no statistical difference in time-to-critical actions for VR vs. standard groups; for example, VR times (in seconds) compared to standard times were 18.1 (SD 10.5) and 18.9 (SD 15.8) (p=.90) for oral suction, and 61.6 (SD 24.8) and 62.8 (SD 26.9) (p=.82) for IV lorazepam completion. Conclusion This pilot trial suggests that VR is feasible for clinical simulation. We did not find a significant difference between the two groups in learner performance. Larger studies are needed to corroborate our findings, investigate the best applications of VR in clinical training, and determine if it could lead to more rapid learning at a lower cost.",2021,,Cureus,13,8,e17091,34527478,,,#5779,Abulfaraj 2021,,
[Virtual simulation for learning cataract surgery],"Adnane, I.; Chahbi, M.; Elbelhadji, M.","INTRODUCTION: The training in phacoemulsification cataract surgery in our context requires a long learning curve for a novice surgeon starting from the observation period to the realization of the different operating stages being supervised by a senior surgeon, all under stressful conditions. Topical or locoregional anesthesia limits the communication in the operating room between the novice surgeon and his mentor; thus, increasing the risk of having more operative complications. To reduce the teaching time of cataract surgery, our department has introduced virtual simulator trainings for phacoemulsification.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To assess the impact of surgical simulator training on residents' performances.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective comparative study in our department in partnership with a private ophthalmology clinic where the simulator is installed. Twelve residents were included in this study, six of them were randomly selected to participate in the phacoemulsification surgical simulator training while the others never used the simulator. The training lasted 30 hours in total. No residents had previous training in phacoemulsification. The parameters studied were: the operating time, the achievement of a circular capsulorhexis of 5-6mm in diameter and well centered, the number of capsular breaks with or without an anterior vitrectomy and finally the accumulated dissipated energy (EDC). The cataract surgery was performed on an Alcon Centurion platform.RESULTS: In the operating room, each resident operated 25 cataracts; we compared the two user groups including the simulator and non simulator user and we noticed a statistically significant difference (P<0.05) in terms of average operating time respectively 20 minutes and 37 minutes. Regarding the realization of capsulorhexis; 22 cases of rhexis wandering and 12 poorly centred rhexis on 150 operated cataracts were identified (22.7%) in the group of residents who received no simulator training versus 10 cases in the simulator user group (6.7%). The cumulative dissipated energy (EDC) was significantly lower in the simulator user group (8.1 versus 18.7). The same is true for the rate of posterior capsular rupture, which is higher in the non-user group of simulator 37 cases (24.6%) versus 10 cases (8%) in the second group.DISCUSSION: Ophthalmic surgery has benefited from the introduction of endo-ocular surgical simulation tools through simulators of vitreoretinal surgery and phacoemulsification; whose main role is primarily pedagogical because a simulator allows young residents to acquire dexterity and autonomy over a shortened period of time in addition to minimizing the risk of complications.CONCLUSION: Initial learning of phacoemulsification cataract surgery should be an integral part of the virtual simulator program before moving to the real conditions of the operating room as it allows for better operative performance with a minimal complication rate.",2020,,Journal Francais d Opthalmologie,43,4,334-340,31987677,,,#5784,Adnane 2020,,
Interactive Anatomy-Augmented Virtual Simulation Training,"Aebersold, M.; Voepel-Lewis, T.; Cherara, L.; Weber, M.; Khouri, C.; Levine, R.; Tait, A. R.","BACKGROUND: Traditionally, clinical psychomotor skills are taught through videos and demonstration by faculty which does not allow for the visualization of internal structures and anatomical landmarks that would enhance the learner skill performance.METHODS: Sophomore and junior nursing students attending a large Midwestern Institution (N=69) participated in this mixed methods study. Students demonstrated their ability to place a nasogastric tube (NGT) after being randomly assigned to usual training (Control group) or an iPad anatomy-augmented virtual simulation training module (AR group). The ability of the participants to demonstrate competence in placing the NGT was assessed using a 17-item competency checklist. After the demonstration, students completed a survey to elicit information about students' level of training, prior experience with NGT placement, satisfaction with the AR technology, and perceptions of AR as a potential teaching tool for clinical skills training.RESULTS: The ability to correctly place the NGT through all the checklist items was statistically significant in the AR group compared with the control group (P = 0.011). Eighty-six percent of participants in the AR group rated AR as superior/far superior to other procedural training programs to which they had been exposed, whereas, only 5.9% of participants in the control group rated the control program as superior/far superior (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Overall the AR module was better received compared with the control group with regards to realism, identifying landmarks, visualization of internal organs, ease of use, usefulness, and promoting learning and understanding.",2018,,Clinical Simulation in Nursing,15,,34-41,29861797,,,#5786,Aebersold 2018,,

Comparing the Effects on Learning Outcomes of Tablet-Based and Virtual Reality-Based Serious Gaming Modules for Basic Life Support Training: Randomized Trial,"Aksoy, E.","BACKGROUND: Serious gaming is recognized as a training tool due its potential for a risk-free educational environment. There is still limited research about using serious gaming modules for emergency skills training.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the effects on the knowledge level of participants after using a tablet-based serious game and a virtual reality (VR)-based serious game for Basic Life Support using a pretest/posttest method.METHODS: The study was designed as a randomized trial comparing pretest and posttest results. A tablet-based and VR-based serious game with identical content was used for 40 participants. Over half of them (22/40, 55%) were included in the VR group and just under half (18/40, 45%) were in the tablet group. Student t test and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to determine the relation between the dependent and independent variables. In order to determine the effect size of the results, the effect size calculator (Cohen d) for t test was used. There is a significant difference between pre- and posttest results in both groups (P=.001; Wilcoxon).RESULTS: Mean posttest results were significantly higher in both groups. The posttest results were significantly higher in the VR group in terms of pre- and posttest changes (P=.021; Student t test).CONCLUSIONS: Past research studies have shown that serious gaming presents a favorable additional tool for medical education.

Performance Monitoring via Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy for Virtual Reality Based Basic Life Support Training,"Aksoy, E.; Izzetoglu, K.; Baysoy, E.; Agrali, A.; Kitapcioglu, D.; Onaral, B.","The use of serious game tools in training of medical professions is steadily growing. However, there is a lack of reliable performance assessment methods to evaluate learner's outcome. The aim of this study is to determine whether functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be used as an additional tool for assessing the learning outcome of virtual reality (VR) based learning modules. The hypothesis is that together with an improvement in learning outcome there would be a decrease in the participants' cerebral oxygenation levels measured from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) region and an increase of participants' serious gaming results. To test this hypothesis, the subjects were recruited and divided into four groups with different combinations of prior virtual reality experience and prior Basic Life Support (BLS) knowledge levels. A VR based serious gaming module for teaching BLS and 16-Channel fNIRS system were used to collect data from the participants. Results of the participants' scores acquired from the serious gaming module were compared with fNIRS measures on the initial and final training sessions. Kruskal Wallis test was run to determine any significant statistical difference between the groups and Mann-Whitney U test was utilized to obtain pairwise comparisons. BLS training scores of the participants acquired from VR based serious game's the learning management system and fNIRS measurements revealed decrease in use of resources from the PFC, but increase in behavioral performance. Importantly, brain-based measures can provide an additional quantitative metric for trainee's expertise development and can assist the medical simulation instructors.",2019,,Frontiers in Neuroscience,13,,1336,31920503,,,#5820,Aksoy 2019,,

Studies suggest that current techniques in endoscopic surgery are prone to disturbance of a surgeon's visual-motor axis, influencing performance, ergonomics and iatrogenic injury rates. The Microsoft<sup> R</sup> HoloLens is a novel head-mounted display that has not been explored within surgical innovation research. This study aims to evaluate the HoloLens as a potential alternative to conventional monitors in endoscopic surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, observational and comparative study recruited 72 participants consisting of novices (n = 28), intermediate-level (n = 24) and experts (n = 20). Participants performed ureteroscopy, within an inflatable operating environment, using a validated training model and the HoloLens mixed-reality device as a monitor. Novices also completed the assigned task using conventional monitors; whilst the experienced groups did not, due to their extensive familiarity. Outcome measures were procedural completion time and performance evaluation (OSATS) score. A final evaluation survey was distributed amongst all participants.RESULTS: The HoloLens facilitated improved outcomes for procedural times (absolute difference, - 73 s; 95% CI - 115 to - 30; P = 0.0011) and OSAT scores (absolute difference, 4.1 points; 95% CI 2.9-5.3; P < 0.0001) compared to conventional monitors. Feedback evaluation demonstrated 97% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the HoloLens will have a role in surgical education (mean rating, 4.6 of 5; 95% CI 4.5-4.8). Furthermore, 95% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the HoloLens is feasible to introduce clinically and will have a role within surgery (mean rating, 4.4 of 5; 95% CI 4.2-4.5).CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the device facilitated improved outcomes of performance in novices and was widely accepted as a surgical visual aid by all groups.

The measurement of sensorimotor ability has lagged behind, despite being a key constraint for safe and efficient practice in procedure-based medical specialties. Virtual reality (VR) haptic simulators, systems able to provide objective measures of sensorimotor performance, are beginning to establish their utility in facilitating sensorimotor skill acquisition, and it is possible that they may also inform the prediction of clinical performance.Methods: A retrospective cohort study examined the relationship between student performance on a haptic VR simulator in the second year of undergraduate dental study with subsequent clinic performance involving patients 2 years later. The predictive ability was tested against a phantom-head crown test (a traditional preclinical dental assessment, in the third year of study).Results: VR scores averaged across the year explained 14% of variance in clinic performance, while the traditional test explained 5%. Students who scored highly on this averaged measure were ~10 times more likely to be high performers in the clinical crown test. Exploratory analysis indicated that single-trial VR scores did not correlate with real-world performance, but the relationship was statistically significant and strongest in the first half of the year and weakened over time.Conclusions: The data demonstrate the potential of a VR haptic simulator to predict clinical performance and open up the possibility of taking a data-driven approach to identifying individuals who could benefit from support in the early stages of training.",2020,,BMJ Simulation & Technology Enhanced Learning,6,5,274-278,35517392,,,#5830,Al-Saud 2020,,

Predictors of virtual reality simulation bronchoscopy performance among novice bronchoscopists,"Aljohaney, A. A.","INTRODUCTION: Simulation-based training is gradually replacing the classic ""apprenticeship"" training model. Predictors of better performance of virtual reality simulation bronchoscopy are not clear.OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the predictors of performance of simulation bronchoscopy among novice bronchoscopists.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive observational cohort study conducted at King Abdulaziz University Clinical Skills and Simulation Center, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. All participants filled a demographic questionnaire and attended a pre-simulation orientation about the requested tasks. The Simbionix bronchoscopy simulator was used in this study. First, each resident performed three trails of basic scope manipulation task to test hand-eye coordination skills. Thereafter, each resident performed the guided anatomical navigation task to accurately examine as many lung segments as possible. Results and metrics were retrieved from the simulator, and statistical analysis was performed using t-test to measure statistically significant P-value (<0.05).RESULTS: Fifty-three internal medicine residents participated in this study. Male residents significantly achieved higher score in the basic scope manipulation task than female residents (65% vs 46%, P<0.001). Furthermore, the percentage of time spent at mid lumen during the scope manipulation was significantly higher for males compared to female residents (48% vs 37%, P=0.003). Residents who were interested in pursuing procedure-based specialty training spent significantly less time in contact with wall (14.6% vs 20.3%, P=0.045). Smokers needed more time to finish the first task (mean 2.5 minutes vs mean 1.1 minutes, P=0.005).CONCLUSION: Simulation bronchoscopy performance was different between genders, smoking status and future interest in pursuing a procedure-based career. Overall, male residents performed better than female residents in basic scope manipulation. Gender differences in performing simulation bronchoscopy need to be examined in future studies.

These steps enable a proper access, facilitating the subsequent steps. To train the access planning process, we propose a VR-based training system.METHOD: We designed and implemented an immersive VR access simulation, where the user is surrounded by a virtual operating room, including medical equipment and virtual staff. The patient's head can be positioned via hand rotation and an arbitrary craniotomy contour can be drawn. The chosen access can be evaluated by exposing the aneurysm using a microscopic view.RESULTS: The evaluation of the simulation took place in three stages: testing the simulation using the think-aloud method, conducting a survey and examining the precision of drawing the contour. Although there are differences between the virtual interactions and their counterparts in reality, the participants liked the immersion and felt present in the operating room. The calculated surface dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance and feedback of the participants show that the difficulty of drawing the craniotomy is appropriate.CONCLUSION: The presented training simulation for head positioning and access planning benefits from the immersive environment. Thus, it is an appropriate training for novice neurosurgeons and medical students with the goal to improve anatomical understanding and to become aware of the importance of the right craniotomy hole.",2022,,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology & Surgery,17,3,449-456,34931299,,,#5858,Allgaier 2022,,

During phase I, participants completed 3 weekly 1-hour training sessions on the UroMentor simulator practicing task 10, where two stones from the left proximal ureter and renal pelvis were extracted using a basket. Objective assessments by the simulator and subjective assessments using the validated Ureteroscopy-Global Rating Scale (URS-GRS) were used to establish the learning curve. During phase II, the URS-GRS tool was used to assess performance of participants in the operating theatre. URS-GRS scores obtained on the simulator and in the operating theatre were correlated.RESULTS: In phase I, eight urology PGTs (PGY1-4) with mean age of 27.8 +/- 2 (25-31) years participated in the study. PGTs practiced a total of 52 times, with a mean operative time of 14.6 +/- 4.3 minutes and a mean fluoroscopy time of 10.4 +/- 12 seconds. Competency in task 10 was achieved after seven trials on the UroMentor simulator. In phase II, 5 PGTs were assessed during 55 consecutive flexible ureteroscopic stone extraction in the operating theatre. The mean operative time was 51.4 +/- 15.2 minutes and the mean fluoroscopy time was 29 +/- 6 seconds. There was a significant positive correlation between URS-GRS scores obtained on the simulator and in the operating theatre (r = 0.9, p = 0.03), thus establishing predictive validity of performance on the UroMentor simulator.CONCLUSIONS: Competency in task 10 on the UroMentor simulator (flexible ureteroscopic stone extraction) was achieved after seven trials.

Face and content validity of the virtual reality simulator 'ScanTrainer R',"Alsalamah, A.; Campo, R.; Tanos, V.; Grimbizis, G.; Van Belle, Y.; Hood, K.; Pugh, N.; Amso, N.","BACKGROUND: Ultrasonography is a first-line imaging in the investigation of women's irregular bleeding and other gynaecological pathologies, e.g. ovarian cysts and early pregnancy problems. However, teaching ultrasound, especially transvaginal scanning, remains a challenge for health professionals. New technology such as simulation may potentially facilitate and expedite the process of learning ultrasound. Simulation may prove to be realistic, very close to real patient scanning experience for the sonographer and objectively able to assist the development of basic skills such as image manipulation, hand-eye coordination and examination technique.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the face and content validity of a virtual reality simulator (ScanTrainer R, MedaPhor plc, Cardiff, Wales, UK) as reflective of real transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) scanning.METHOD: A questionnaire with 14 simulator-related statements was distributed to a number of participants with differing levels of sonography experience in order to determine the level of agreement between the use of the simulator in training and real practice.RESULTS: There were 36 participants: novices (n = 25) and experts (n = 11) who rated the simulator. Median scores of face validity statements between experts and non-experts using a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings ranged between 7.5 and 9.0 (p > 0.05) indicated a high level of agreement.

This new simulator is called SIMISGEST-VR (Simulator of Minimally Invasive Surgery mediated by Gestures - Virtual Reality).METHODS: In this prospective observational validity study, the authors looked for multiple sources of evidence (known group construct validity, prior videogaming experience, internal structure, test-retest reliability, and consequences of testing) for the proposed SIMISGEST-VR tasks. Undergraduate students (n=100, reference group), surgical residents (n=20), and experts in minimally invasive surgery (n=28) took part in the study. After answering a demographic questionnaire and watching a video of the tasks to be performed, they individually repeated each task 10 times with each hand. The simulator provided concurrent, immediate, and terminal feedback and obtained the task metrics (time and score). From the reference group, 29 undergraduate students were randomly selected to perform the tasks 6 months later in order to determine test-retest reliability.RESULTS: Evidence from multiple sources, including strong intrarater reliability and internal consistency, considerable evidence for the hypothesized consequences of testing, and partial confirmation for relations to other variables, supports the validity of the scores and the metrics used to train and teach basic psychomotor skills for minimally invasive surgery via a new low-cost portable simulator that utilizes interaction technology mediated by gestures.CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained provided multiple sources of evidence to validate SIMISGEST-VR tasks aimed at training novices with no prior experience and enabling them to learn basic psychomotor skills for minimally invasive surgery.",2020,,JMIR Serious Games,8,4,e19723,33107833,,,#5871,Alvarez-Lopez 2020,,
Use of a Low-Cost Portable 3D Virtual Reality Gesture-Mediated Simulator for Training and Learning Basic Psychomotor Skills in Minimally Invasive Surgery: Development and Content Validity Study,"Alvarez-Lopez, F.; Maina, M. F.; Saigi-Rubio, F.","BACKGROUND: Simulation in virtual environments has become a new paradigm for surgeon training in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). However, this technology is expensive and difficult to access.OBJECTIVE: This study aims first to describe the development of a new gesture-based simulator for learning skills in MIS and, second, to establish its fidelity to the criterion and sources of content-related validity evidence.METHODS: For the development of the gesture-mediated simulator for MIS using virtual reality (SIMISGEST-VR), a design-based research (DBR) paradigm was adopted. For the second objective, 30 participants completed a questionnaire, with responses scored on a 5-point Likert scale. A literature review on the validity of the MIS training-VR (MIST-VR) was conducted. The study of fidelity to the criterion was rated using a 10-item questionnaire, while the sources of content-related validity evidence were assessed using 10 questions about the simulator training capacity and 6 questions about MIS tasks, and an iterative process of instrument pilot testing was performed.RESULTS: A good enough prototype of a gesture-based simulator was developed with metrics and feedback for learning psychomotor skills in MIS. As per the survey conducted to assess the fidelity to the criterion, all 30 participants felt that most aspects of the simulator were adequately realistic and that it could be used as a tool for teaching basic psychomotor skills in laparoscopic surgery (Likert score: 4.07-4.73). The sources of content-related validity evidence showed that this study's simulator is a reliable training tool and that the exercises enable learning of the basic psychomotor skills required in MIS (Likert score: 4.28-4.67).CONCLUSIONS: The development of gesture-based 3D virtual environments for training and learning basic psychomotor skills in MIS opens up a new approach to low-cost, portable simulation that allows ubiquitous learning and preoperative warm-up. Fidelity to the criterion was duly evaluated, which allowed a good enough prototype to be achieved. Content-related validity evidence for SIMISGEST-VR was also obtained.",2020,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,22,7,e17491,32673217,,,#5872,Alvarez-Lopez 2020,,
Augmented reality simulator for CT-guided interventions,"Amiras, D.; Hurkxkens, T. J.; Figueroa, D.; Pratt, P. J.; Pitrola, B.; Watura, C.; Rostampour, S.; Shimshon, G. J.; Hamady, M.","INTRODUCTION: CT-guided interventions are taught using a mentored approach on real patients. It is well established that simulation is a valuable training tool in medicine. This project assessed the feasibility and acceptance of replicating a CT-guided intervention using a bespoke software application with an augmented reality head-mounted display (ARHMD).METHODS: A virtual patient was generated using a CT dataset obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive. A surface mesh of a virtual patient was projected into the field-of-view of the operator. ChArUco markers, placed on both the needle and agar jelly phantom, were tracked using RGB cameras built into the ARHMD. A virtual CT slice simulating the needle position was generated on voice command. The application was trialled by senior interventional radiologists and trainee radiologists with a structured questionnaire evaluating face validity and technical aspects.RESULTS: Sixteen users trialled the application and feedback was received from all. Eleven felt the accuracy and realism was adequate for training and twelve felt more confident about their CT biopsy skills after this training session.DISCUSSION: The study showed the feasibility of simulating a CT-guided procedure with augmented reality and that this could be used as a training tool.KEY POINTS: * Simulating a CT-guided procedure using augmented reality is possible. * The simulator developed could be an effective training tool for clinical practical skills. * Complexity of cases can be tailored to address the training level demands.",2021,,European Radiology,31,12,8897-8902,34109488,,,#5883,Amiras 2021,,
Virtual reality simulation training of mastoidectomy - studies on novice performance,"Andersen, S. A.","Virtual reality (VR) simulation-based training is increasingly used in surgical technical skills training including in temporal bone surgery. The potential of VR simulation in enabling high-quality surgical training is great and VR simulation allows high-stakes and complex procedures such as mastoidectomy to be trained repeatedly, independent of patients and surgical tutors, outside traditional learning environments such as the OR or the temporal bone lab, and with fewer of the constraints of traditional training. This thesis aims to increase the evidence-base of VR simulation training of mastoidectomy and, by studying the final-product performances of novices, investigates the transfer of skills to the current gold-standard training modality of cadaveric dissection, the effect of different practice conditions and simulator-integrated tutoring on performance and retention of skills, and the role of directed, self-regulated learning. Technical skills in mastoidectomy were transferable from the VR simulation environment to cadaveric dissection with significant improvement in performance after directed, self-regulated training in the VR temporal bone simulator. Distributed practice led to a better learning outcome and more consolidated skills than massed practice and also resulted in a more consistent performance after three months of non-practice. Simulator-integrated tutoring accelerated the initial learning curve but also caused over-reliance on tutoring, which resulted in a drop in performance when the simulator-integrated tutor-function was discontinued. The learning curves were highly individual but often plateaued early and at an inadequate level, which related to issues concerning both the procedure and the VR simulator, over-reliance on the tutor function and poor self-assessment skills. Future simulator-integrated automated assessment could potentially resolve some of these issues and provide trainees with both feedback during the procedure and immediate assessment following each procedure. Standard setting by establishing a proficiency level that can be used for mastery learning with deliberate practice could also further sophisticate directed, self-regulated learning in VR simulation-based training. VR simulation-based training should be embedded in a systematic and competency-based training curriculum for high-quality surgical skills training, ultimately leading to improved safety and patient care.",2016,,Danish Medical Journal,63,8,,27477803,,,#5892,Andersen 2016,,
Retention of Mastoidectomy Skills After Virtual Reality Simulation Training,"Andersen, S. A.; Konge, L.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Sorensen, M. S.","IMPORTANCE: The ultimate goal of surgical training is consolidated skills with a consistently high performance. However, surgical skills are heterogeneously retained and depend on a variety of factors, including the task, cognitive demands, and organization of practice. Virtual reality (VR) simulation is increasingly being used in surgical skills training, including temporal bone surgery, but there is a gap in knowledge on the retention of mastoidectomy skills after VR simulation training.OBJECTIVES: To determine the retention of mastoidectomy skills after VR simulation training with distributed and massed practice and to investigate participants' cognitive load during retention procedures.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective 3-month follow-up study of a VR simulation trial was conducted from February 6 to September 19, 2014, at an academic teaching hospital among 36 medical students: 19 from a cohort trained with distributed practice and 17 from a cohort trained with massed practice.INTERVENTIONS: Participants performed 2 virtual mastoidectomies in a VR simulator a mean of 3.2 months (range, 2.4-5.0 months) after completing initial training with 12 repeated procedures. Practice blocks were spaced apart in time (distributed), or all procedures were performed in 1 day (massed).MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance of the virtual mastoidectomy as assessed by 2 masked senior otologists using a modified Welling scale, as well as cognitive load as estimated by reaction time to perform a secondary task.RESULTS: Among 36 participants, mastoidectomy final-product skills were largely retained at 3 months (mean change in score, 0.1 points; P = .89) regardless of practice schedule, but the group trained with massed practice took more time to complete the task. The performance of the massed practice group increased significantly from the first to the second retention procedure (mean change, 1.8 points; P = .001), reflecting that skills were less consolidated. For both groups, increases in reaction times in the secondary task (distributed practice group: mean pretraining relative reaction time, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.37-1.47]; mean end of training relative reaction time, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.16-1.32]; and mean retention relative reaction time, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.30-1.42]; massed practice group: mean pretraining relative reaction time, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.28-1.40]; mean end of training relative reaction time, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.21-1.42]; and mean retention relative reaction time, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.31-1.46]) indicated that cognitive load during the virtual procedures had returned to the pretraining level.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mastoidectomy skills acquired under time-distributed practice conditions were retained better than skills acquired under massed practice conditions. Complex psychomotor skills should be regularly reinforced to consolidate both motor and cognitive aspects. Virtual reality simulation training provides the opportunity for such repeated training and should be integrated into training curricula.",2016,,JAMA Otolaryngology-- Head & Neck Surgery,142,7,635-40,27124506,,,#5894,Andersen 2016,,
Mapping the plateau of novices in virtual reality simulation training of mastoidectomy,"Andersen, S. A.; Konge, L.; Mikkelsen, P. T.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Sorensen, M. S.","OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To explore why novices' performance plateau in directed, self-regulated virtual reality (VR) simulation training and how performance can be improved.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.METHODS: Data on the performances of 40 novices who had completed repeated, directed, self-regulated VR simulation training of mastoidectomy were included. Data were analyzed to identify key areas of difficulty as well as the procedures terminated without using all the time allowed.RESULTS: Novices had difficulty in avoiding drilling holes in the outer anatomical boundaries of the mastoidectomy and frequently made injuries to vital structures such as the lateral semicircular canal, the ossicles, and the facial nerve. The simulator-integrated tutor function improved performance on many of these items, but overreliance on tutoring was observed. Novices also demonstrated poor self-assessment skills and often did not make use of the allowed time, lacking knowledge on when to stop or how to excel.CONCLUSION: Directed, self-regulated VR simulation training of mastoidectomy needs a strong instructional design with specific process goals to support deliberate practice because cognitive effort is needed for novices to improve beyond an initial plateau.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.

"Understanding the effects of structured self-assessment in directed, self-regulated simulation-based training of mastoidectomy: A mixed methods study","Andersen, S. A. W.; Frendo, M.; Guldager, M.; Sorensen, M. S.","OBJECTIVE: Self-directed training represents a challenge in simulation-based training as low cognitive effort can occur when learners overrate their own level of performance. This study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying the positive effects of a structured self-assessment intervention during simulation-based training of mastoidectomy.METHODS: A prospective, educational cohort study of a novice training program consisting of directed, self-regulated learning with distributed practice (5x3 procedures) in a virtual reality temporal bone simulator. The intervention consisted of structured self-assessment after each procedure using a rating form supported by small videos. Semi-structured telephone interviews upon completion of training were conducted with 13 out of 15 participants. Interviews were analysed using directed content analysis and triangulated with quantitative data on secondary task reaction time for cognitive load estimation and participants' self-assessment scores.RESULTS: Six major themes were identified in the interviews: goal-directed behaviour, use of learning supports for scaffolding of the training, cognitive engagement, motivation from self-assessment, self-assessment bias, and feedback on self-assessment (validation). Participants seemed to self-regulate their learning by forming individual sub-goals and strategies within the overall goal of the procedure. They scaffolded their learning through the available learning supports. Finally, structured self-assessment was reported to increase the participants' cognitive engagement, which was further supported by a quantitative increase in cognitive load.CONCLUSIONS: Structured self-assessment in simulation-based surgical training of mastoidectomy seems to promote cognitive engagement and motivation in the learning task and to facilitate self-regulated learning.",2020,,Journal of Otology,15,4,117-123,33293910,,,#5899,Andersen 2020,,
The effect of distributed virtual reality simulation training on cognitive load during subsequent dissection training,"Andersen, S. A. W.; Konge, L.; Sorensen, M. S.","BACKGROUND: Complex tasks such as surgical procedures can induce excessive cognitive load (CL), which can have a negative effect on learning, especially for novices.AIM: To investigate if repeated and distributed virtual reality (VR) simulation practice induces a lower CL and higher performance in subsequent cadaveric dissection training.METHODS: In a prospective, controlled cohort study, 37 residents in otorhinolaryngology received VR simulation training either as additional distributed practice prior to course participation (intervention) (9 participants) or as standard practice during the course (control) (28 participants). Cognitive load was estimated as the relative change in secondary-task reaction time during VR simulation and cadaveric procedures.RESULTS: Structured distributed VR simulation practice resulted in lower mean reaction times (32% vs. 47% for the intervention and control group, respectively, p < 0.01) as well as a superior final-product performance during subsequent cadaveric dissection training.CONCLUSIONS: Repeated and distributed VR simulation causes a lower CL to be induced when the learning situation is increased in complexity. A suggested mechanism is the formation of mental schemas and reduction of the intrinsic CL. This has potential implications for surgical skills training and suggests that structured, distributed training be systematically implemented in surgical training curricula.",2018,,Medical teacher,40,7,684-689,29730952,,,#5902,Andersen 2018,,
The effect of implementing cognitive load theory-based design principles in virtual reality simulation training of surgical skills: a randomized controlled trial,"Andersen, S. A. W.; Mikkelsen, P. T.; Konge, L.; Caye-Thomasen, P.; Sorensen, M. S.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive overload can inhibit learning, and cognitive load theory-based instructional design principles can be used to optimize learning situations. This study aims to investigate the effect of implementing cognitive load theory-based design principles in virtual reality simulation training of mastoidectomy.METHODS: Eighteen novice medical students received 1 h of self-directed virtual reality simulation training of the mastoidectomy procedure randomized for standard instructions (control) or cognitive load theory-based instructions with a worked example followed by a problem completion exercise (intervention). Participants then completed two post-training virtual procedures for assessment and comparison. Cognitive load during the post-training procedures was estimated by reaction time testing on an integrated secondary task. Final-product analysis by two blinded expert raters was used to assess the virtual mastoidectomy performances.RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group had a significantly increased cognitive load during the post-training procedures compared with the control group (52 vs. 41 %, p = 0.02). This was also reflected in the final-product performance: the intervention group had a significantly lower final-product score than the control group (13.0 vs. 15.4, p < 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: Initial instruction using worked examples followed by a problem completion exercise did not reduce the cognitive load or improve the performance of the following procedures in novices. Increased cognitive load when part tasks needed to be integrated in the post-training procedures could be a possible explanation for this. Other instructional designs and methods are needed to lower the cognitive load and improve the performance in virtual reality surgical simulation training of novices.",2016,,Advances in Simulation,1,,20,29449989,,,#5903,Andersen 2016,,
Expert sampling of VR simulator metrics for automated assessment of mastoidectomy performance,"Andersen, S. A. W.; Mikkelsen, P. T.; Sorensen, M. S.","OBJECTIVE: Often the assessment of mastoidectomy performance requires time-consuming manual rating. Virtual reality (VR) simulators offer potentially useful automated assessment and feedback but should be supported by validity evidence. We aimed to investigate simulator metrics for automated assessment based on the expert performance approach, comparison with an established assessment tool, and the consequences of standard setting.METHODS: The performances of 11 experienced otosurgeons and 37 otorhinolaryngology residents. Participants performed three mastoidectomies in the Visible Ear Simulator. Nine residents contributed additional data on repeated practice in the simulator. One hundred and twenty-nine different performance metrics were collected by the simulator and final-product files were saved. These final products were analyzed using a modified Welling Scale by two blinded raters.RESULTS: Seventeen metrics could discriminate between resident and experienced surgeons' performances. These metrics mainly expressed various aspects of efficiency: Experts demonstrated more goal-directed behavior and less hesitancy, used less time, and selected large and sharp burrs more often. The combined metrics-based score (MBS) demonstrated significant discriminative ability between experienced surgeons and residents with a mean difference of 16.4% (95% confidence interval [12.6-20.2], P << 0.001). A pass/fail score of 83.6% was established. The MBS correlated poorly with the final-product score but excellently with the final-product score per time.CONCLUSION: The MBS mainly reflected efficiency components of the mastoidectomy procedure, and although it could have some uses in self-directed training, it fails to measure and encourage safe routines. Supplemental approaches and feedback are therefore required in VR simulation training of mastoidectomy.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2b Laryngoscope, 129:2170-2177, 2019.",2019,,Laryngoscope,129,9,2170-2177,30628093,,,#5904,Andersen 2019,,

Use of 360degree virtual reality video in medical obstetrical education: a quasi-experimental design,"Arents, V.; de Groot, P. C. M.; Struben, V. M. D.; van Stralen, K. J.","BACKGROUND: Video-based teaching has been part of medical education for some time but 360degree videos using a virtual reality (VR) device are a new medium that offer extended possibilities. We investigated whether adding a 360degree VR video to the internship curriculum leads to an improvement of long-term recall of specific knowledge on a gentle Caesarean Sections (gCS) and on general obstetric knowledge.METHODS: Two weeks prior to their Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) internship, medical students were divided in teaching groups, that did or did not have access to a VR-video of a gCS. Six weeks after their O&G internship, potentially having observed one or multiple real-life CSs, knowledge on the gCS was assessed with an open questionnaire, and knowledge on general obstetrics with a multiple-choice questionnaire. Furthermore we assessed experienced anxiety during in-person attendance of CSs, and we asked whether the interns would have wanted to attend more CSs in-person. The 360degree VR video group was questioned about their experience directly after they watched the video. We used linear regression analyses to determine significant effects on outcomes.RESULTS: A total of 89 medical students participated, 41 in the 360degree VR video group and 48 in the conventional study group. Watching the 360degree VR video did not result in a difference in either specific or general knowledge retention between the intervention group and the conventional study group. This was both true for the grade received for the internship, the open-ended questions as well as the multiple-choice questions and this did not change after adjustment for confounding factors. Still, 83.4% of the 360degree VR video-group reported that more videos should be used in training to prepare for surgical procedures. In the 360degree VR video-group 56.7% reported side effects like nausea or dizziness. After adjustment for the number of attended CSs during the practical internship, students in the 360degree VR video-group stated less often (p = 0.04) that they would have liked to attend more CSs in-person as compared to the conventional study group.CONCLUSION: Even though the use of 360degree VR video did not increase knowledge, it did offer a potential alternative for attending a CS in-person and a new way to prepare the students for their first operating room experiences.",2021,,BMC medical education,21,1,202,33836736,,,#5941,Arents 2021,,

The complexity of the procedures increases through the practical modules. It is complemented by a semester evaluation.DISCUSSION: Currently most of the efforts in teaching with simulators focus on medical students and first-and second-year residents.

This is the first report of a comprehensive, multicomponent teaching model with VR as a primary component to neurosurgical and neuroanatomy education for pre-clerkship medical students.DESIGN: Twelve second-year medical students were included in this prospective survey study that was conducted to evaluate a year-long neurosurgery elective course with an interactive VR platform as a primary teaching tool for neuroanatomy and neurosurgical procedures. The course had 4 components: (1) didactic/lecture-based learning, (2) problem-based learning, (3) hands-on skills lab, and (4) VR-based learning through Surgical Theater's Precision VR visualization platform. Outcome measures were based on confidence levels measured on pre- and post-course competency confidence surveys in students' ability to identify neuroanatomical structures, interpret neuroradiological imaging, and analyze neurosurgical cases, and student feedback on their experience with VR on a postcourse survey.SETTING: The survey study was conducted in the neurosurgery library and conference room at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.PARTICIPANTS: All 12 second-year medical students who enrolled in the neurosurgery zero-credit hour course completed the course.RESULTS: At course conclusion, 100% of students reported significantly higher competency confidence levels on all topics, and 100% agreed utilizing VR helped them gain a deeper understanding of neuroanatomy/neurosurgery. 92% agreed that using VR helped them better retain the anatomical/functional details of the brain/spine, and 69% better understand neurosurgical skills taught, respectively. 100% of students found the course to be a valuable learning experience and VR a useful learning tool.CONCLUSION: A comprehensive multi-component neurosurgery elective course using VR as a primary teaching tool may improve neurosurgical education in medical school.",2021,,Journal of Surgical Education,78,4,1350-1356,33221253,,,#5963,Atli 2021,,
Comparing the training effectiveness of virtual reality and role play among future mental health providers,"Atuel, H.

The study examines each training modality in six areas: (a) self-efficacy, (b) initial engagement, (c) recognizing and responding to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, (d) recognizing and responding to symptoms of suicide, (e) military cultural competence, and (f) overall competence.METHOD: A quasi-experimental nonequivalent groups study design was used. The sample comprised students enrolled in a graduate-level program (RP = 61; VC-T = 75). Participants completed pretest measures, attended training, and completed posttest measures.RESULTS: Broadly, the findings revealed that RP and the VC-T are equally effective in increasing trainees' self-efficacy, recognition and response to posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, recognition and response to suicide symptoms, military cultural competence, and overall competence. These results suggest that regardless of training modality, trainees demonstrated increased clinical skills and competencies needed for working with the military population.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that both RP and the VC-T are equally effective, which opens the possibilities of implementing the VC-T as a training tool that has greater reach compared with RP. As more graduate programs offer an online version of their traditional on-ground coursework, the VC-T is an opportunity to have 1 training platform for both on-ground and online students.

The primary outcome is the number of procedures required to achieve proficiency, where proficiency is defined as achieving a learning curve plateau of 28 or more on an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) assessment scale, for three consecutive operations, without any complications. All participants will be followed up either until they complete 25 procedures or for 18 months. Development of the URS SBT curriculum took place through a two-round Delphi process.RESULTS: A total of 47 respondents, consisting of trainees (n = 24) with URS experience and urolithiasis specialists (n = 23), participated in round 1 of the Delphi process. Specialists (n = 10) finalized the content of the curriculum in round 2. The developed interventional curriculum consists of initial theoretic knowledge through didactic lectures followed by select tasks and cases on the URO-Mentor (Simbionix, Lod, Israel) VR Simulator, Uro-Scopic Trainer (Limbs & Things, Bristol, UK) and Scope Trainer (Mediskills, Manchester, UK) models for both semi-rigid and flexible URS. Respondents also selected relevant non-technical skills scenarios and cadaveric simulation tasks as additional components, with delivery subject to local availability.CONCLUSIONS: SIMULATE is the first multicentre trial investigating the effect and transferability of supplementary SBT on operating performance and patient outcomes. An evidence-based training curriculum is presented, developed with expert and trainee input. Participants will be followed and the primary outcome, number of procedures required to proficiency, will be reported alongside key clinical secondary outcomes, (ISCRTN 12260261).",2020,,BJU International,126,1,202-211,32189446,,,#5972,Aydin 2020,,
Robotic Surgery: The Impact of Simulation and Other Innovative Platforms on Performance and Training,"Azadi, S.; Green, I. C.; Arnold, A.; Truong, M.; Potts, J.; Martino, M. A.","OBJECTIVE: To review the current status of robotic training and the impact of various training platforms on the performance of robotic surgical trainees.DATA SOURCES: Literature review of Google Scholar and PubMed. The search terms included a combination of the following: ""robotic training,"" ""simulation,"" ""robotic curriculum,"" ""obgyn residency robotic training,"" ""virtual reality robotic training,"" ""DaVinci training,"" ""surgical simulation,"" ""gyn surgical training."" The sources considered for inclusion included peer-reviewed articles, literature reviews, textbook chapters, and statements from various institutions involved in resident training.METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: A literature search of Google Scholar and PubMed using terms related to robotic surgery and robotics training, as mentioned in the ""Data Sources"" section.RESULTS: Multiple novel platforms that use machine learning and real-time video feedback to teach and evaluate robotic surgical skills have been developed over recent years. Various training curricula, virtual reality simulators, and other robotic training tools have been shown to enhance robotic surgical education and improve surgical skills. The integration of didactic learning, simulation, and intraoperative teaching into more comprehensive training curricula shows positive effects on robotic skills proficiency. Few robotic surgery training curricula have been validated through peer-reviewed study, and there is more work to be completed in this area. In addition, there is a lack of information about how the skills obtained through robotics curricula and simulation translate into operating room performance and patient outcomes.CONCLUSION: Data collected to date show promising advances in the training of robotic surgeons. A diverse array of curricula for training robotic surgeons continue to emerge, and existing teaching modalities are evolving to keep up with the rapidly growing demand for proficient robotic surgeons. Futures areas of growth include establishing competency benchmarks for existing training tools, validating existing curricula, and determining how to translate the acquired skills in simulation into performance in the operating room and patient outcomes. Many surgical training platforms are beginning to expand beyond discrete robotic skills training to procedure-specific and team training. There is still a wealth of research to be done to understand how to create an effective training experience for gynecologic surgical trainees and robotics teams.",2021,,Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology,28,3,490-495,33310145,,,#5975,Azadi 2021,,

H.","BACKGROUND: Heterogeneous access to clinical learning opportunities and inconsistency in teaching is a common source of dissatisfaction among medical students. This was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited exposure to patients for clinical teaching.METHODS: We conducted a proof-of-concept study at a London teaching hospital using mixed reality (MR) technology (HoloLens2 TM) to deliver a remote access teaching ward round.RESULTS: Students unanimously agreed that use of this technology was enjoyable and provided teaching that was otherwise inaccessible. The majority of participants gave positive feedback on the MR (holographic) content used (n = 8 out of 11) and agreed they could interact with and have their questions answered by the clinician leading the ward round (n = 9). Quantitative and free text feedback from students, patients and faculty members demonstrated that this is a feasible, acceptable and effective method for delivery of clinical education.DISCUSSION: We have used this technology in a novel way to transform the delivery of medical education and enable consistent access to high-quality teaching. This can now be integrated across the curriculum and will include remote access to specialist clinics and surgery. A library of bespoke MR educational resources will be created for future generations of medical students and doctors to use on an international scale.",2021,,The clinical teacher,18,4,386-390,33786988,,,#5999,Bala 2021,,
Leveraging virtual reality to train certified nursing assistants as essential dementia-care personnel in the age of COVID-19,"Balas, J. S.; Phelps, E. B.; Shaw, C.; Washington, E.; Glover, C. M.; Ludwig, G. A.; Bennett, D. A.; Fleischman, D. A.; Volgman, A. S.; Aggarwal, N. T.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has placed an extraordinary and disproportionate level of responsibility and risk on certified nursing assistants (CNAs) caring for persons with dementia (PWD) relative to their training, resources, and compensation levels. Nearly one-quarter of COVID-19 deaths in the United States have been nursing home residents and staff. Despite providing the majority of direct care, CNAs are amongst the most under-resourced and under-trained frontline workers. Given their essentiality, it is critical to support CNAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this work is to provide CNAs with a space to strengthen their knowledge and confidence in caring for PWD. This pilot study applies a virtual reality (VR) curriculum to train CNAs regarding the lived experiences of PWD and their loved ones. The VR vignette portrays a Latinx woman, Beatriz, through progressive stages of Alzheimer's disease.METHOD: Chicago Methodist Senior Services (CMSS) CNAs were recruited (N=7; 86% female, 86% Black) for a seven-week online training program consisting of 1.5 hours per week. Each class included a didactic lecture and an Embodied Labs VR module depicting a first-person experience of dementia through a distributive model approach. The program concluded with two recorded focus groups. Participants completed the UCLA Geriatric Attitudes Scale, a dementia knowledge assessment, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index surveys, and a COVID-19 Impact questionnaire. Current analyses include qualitative content analysis for focus group data and descriptive, quantitative statistics for pre-and post-VR intervention surveys.RESULT: Preliminary results demonstrate that CNAs endorsed a positive change in attitudes toward older adults (p=0.069), a deepened understanding of dementia, and increased confidence in caregiving skills. Focus groups allowed CNAs to discuss changes in resident behavior and support one another through a virtual platform during a global pandemic.CONCLUSION: Combining traditional didactic lectures with VR-based curricula provided CNAs with foundational knowledge and first-hand experience of dementia pathology. Participants reported greater levels of insight and empathy for PWD. Future aims include expansion of training content to include end-of-life conversations, LGBTQIA aging, and Lewy body dementia.",2021,,Alzheimer's & Dementia,17 Suppl 11,,e051128,34971052,,,#6001,Balas 2021,,
Feasibility of an augmented reality cardiopulmonary resuscitation training system for health care providers,"Balian, S.; McGovern, S. K.; Abella, B. S.; Blewer, A. L.; Leary, M.","AIM OF THE STUDY: Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to offer a novel approach to CPR training that supplements conventional training methods with gamification and a more interactive learning experience. This is done through computer-generated imagery superimposed on users' view of the real environment to simulate interactive training scenarios. We sought to test the feasibility of an AR CPR training system (CPReality) for health care providers (HCPs).METHODS: In this feasibility trial, a CPR training manikin was integrated with a commercial AR device (Microsoft HoloLens) to provide participants with real-time audio-visual feedback via a holographic overlay of blood flow to vital organs dependent on CC quality. In this system, higher quality CC visually improved virtual blood circulation. HCPs performed a 2-minute cycle of hands-only CPR using only the AR system, and CC parameters were recorded. Descriptive data on participants' demographics, CC quality, and satisfaction with the training environment were reported using quantitative and qualitative analysis.RESULTS: Between 10/2018-11/2018, we enrolled a convenience sample of 51 HCPs. The median age of participants was 31 years (IQR 27-41), 71% (36/51) were female, and 67% (34/51) were registered nurses. CC rates (mean 126 +/- 12.9 cpm), depths (median 53 mm, IQR 46-58), and percent with complete recoil (median 80%, IQR 12-100) were consistent with guideline recommendations for good quality CPR. Participants were predominantly satisfied with the system, with 82% perceiving the experience as realistic, 98% recognizing the visualizations as helpful for training, and 94% willing to use the application in future CPR training.CONCLUSIONS: As AR is increasingly applied in the healthcare setting, integration in CPR training offers a novel and promising educational approach. In this convenience sample of trained HCPs, high quality CC delivery was feasible using the AR CPR training system which was received favorably by most participants.",2019,,Heliyon,5,8,e02205,31406943,,,#6002,Balian 2019,,
The Effects of Augmented Reality on Prelicensure Nursing Students' Anxiety Levels,"Ball, S.; Hussey, L. C.","BACKGROUND: Prelicensure nursing students experience high anxiety as they enter the clinical setting, which can have a negative impact on learning care performance and critical thinking. This study explored the viability of an innovative technological teaching strategy, augmented reality (AR), as a platform to prepare students and decrease their anxiety levels when entering a new environment.METHOD: A pretest/posttest quasiexperimental design was used to assess the effect of AR 360 photosphere on preli-censure nursing students' anxiety levels as they entered a new clinical environment compared with anxiety levels of prelicensure nursing students who participated in the traditional faculty-led orientation method.RESULTS: Students from three midwestern colleges of nursing completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before and after completing the AR 360 photosphere orientation or a faculty-led orientation. An independent t test revealed no difference in students' anxiety levels between the two methods of orientation.CONCLUSION: Although there were no significant differences in nursing students' anxiety levels between the two methods of clinical orientation, the AR 360 can be a valuable method of orientation that saves faculty time and ensures more consistent and uniform content compared with the traditional faculty orientation method.

Virtual reality hip arthroscopy simulator demonstrates sufficient face validity,"Bartlett, J. D.; Lawrence, J. E.; Khanduja, V.","PURPOSE: To test the face validity of the hip diagnostics module of a virtual reality hip arthroscopy simulator.METHODS: A total of 25 orthopaedic surgeons, 7 faculty members and 18 orthopaedic residents, performed diagnostic supine hip arthroscopies of a healthy virtual reality hip joint using a 70degree arthroscope. Twelve specific targets were visualised within the central compartment; six via the anterior portal, three via the anterolateral portal and three via the posterolateral portal. This task was immediately followed by a questionnaire regarding the realism and training capability of the system. This consisted of seven questions addressing the verisimilitude of the simulator and five questions addressing the training environment of the simulator. Each question consisted of a statement stem and 10-point Likert scale. Following similar work in surgical simulators, a rating of 7 or above was considered an acceptable level of realism.RESULTS: The diagnostic hip arthroscopy module was found to have an acceptable level of realism in all domains apart from the tactile feedback received from the soft tissue. 23 out of 25 participants (92%) felt the simulator provided a non-threatening learning environment and 22 participants (88%) stated they enjoyed using the simulator. It was most frequently agreed that the level of trainees who would benefit most from the simulator were registrars and fellows (22 participants; 88%). Additionally, 21 of the participants (84%) agreed that this would be a beneficial training modality for foundation and core trainees, and 20 participants (80%) agreed that his would be beneficial for consultants.CONCLUSIONS: This VR hip arthroscopy simulator was demonstrated to have a sufficient level of realism, thus establishing its face validity. These results suggest this simulator has sufficient realism for use in the acquisition of basic arthroscopic skills and supports its use in orthopaedics surgical training.Level of evidence: I.",2019,,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",27,10,3162-3167,29995167,,,#6030,Bartlett 2019,,
The learning curves of a validated virtual reality hip arthroscopy simulator,"Bartlett, J. D.; Lawrence, J. E.; Yan, M.; Guevel, B.; Stewart, M. E.; Audenaert, E.; Khanduja, V.","INTRODUCTION: Decreases in trainees' working hours, coupled with evidence of worse outcomes when hip arthroscopies are performed by inexperienced surgeons, mandate an additional means of training. Though virtual reality simulation has been adopted by other surgical specialities, its slow uptake in arthroscopic training is due to a lack of evidence as to its benefits. These benefits can be demonstrated through learning curves associated with simulator training-with practice reflecting increases in validated performance metrics.METHODS: Twenty-five medical students with no previous experience of hip arthroscopy completed seven weekly simulated arthroscopies of a healthy virtual hip joint using a 70degree arthroscope in the supine position. Twelve targets were visualised within the central compartment, six via the anterior portal, three via the anterolateral portal and three via the posterolateral portal. Task duration, number of collisions (bone and soft-tissue), and distance travelled by arthroscope were measured by the simulator for every session of each student.RESULTS: Learning curves were demonstrated by the students, with improvements in time taken, number of collisions (bone and soft-tissue), collision length and efficiency of movement (all p < 0.01). Improvements in time taken, efficiency of movement and number of collisions with soft-tissue were first seen in session 3 and improvements in all other parameters were seen in session 4. No differences were found after session 5 for time taken and length of soft-tissue collision. No differences in number of collisions (bone and soft-tissue), length of collisions with bone, and efficiency of movement were found after session 6.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate learning curves for a hip arthroscopy simulator, with significant improvements seen after three sessions. All performance metrics were found to improved, demonstrating sufficient visuo-haptic consistency within the virtual environment, enabling individuals to develop basic arthroscopic skills.",2020,,Archives of Orthopaedic & Trauma Surgery,140,6,761-767,31989245,,,#6032,Bartlett 2020,,

Virtual reality-based medical education versus lecture-based method in teaching start triage lessons in emergency medical students: Virtual reality in medical education,"Behmadi, S.; Asadi, F.; Okhovati, M.; Ershad Sarabi, R.","INTRODUCTION: Epidemics such as the recent one, COVID-19, have caused a change in education and its methods. Virtual simulation is one of the types of technology used in medical education and related sciences. Virtual simulation provides practical and clinical medical education in a safe, cost-effective, reproducible, and flexible learning environment where students can practice over and over in a standard environment. This study was conducted to compare the effect of virtual-based medical education versus lecture-based method in teaching start triage lessons in emergency medical students in educational and medical centers affiliated to Birjand University of Medical Sciences Ferdows, Paramedical School, in 2020.METHODS: This is a quasi-experimental study. All 44 students of emergency medicine registered for triage course participated in the study. They were divided into two homogenous groups which were matched based on their grade point average. The simple triage and rapid transport (START) triage course was taught in the traditional way- lecture based- from the beginning of the semester to the middle of the semester; then, the other group (simulation-based) was trained in the second half of the same semester using virtual simulation.RESULTS: The students' rate of learning was measured by their scores at the end of the course exam in both groups. The mean scores of virtual simulation-based education were slightly higher than those of the lecture-based education, but it was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The students were more satisfied with virtual simulation-based education than the lecture-based and the difference between the mean scores of satisfaction was statistically significant (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that VR can effectively improve knowledge in undergraduate emergency student's education, but it was not more effective than traditional educational methods. More experimental studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm that virtual simulation-based education can more effectively improve knowledge in teaching practical lessons such as triage.",2022,,Journal of Advances in Medical Education & Professionalism,10,1,48-53,34981005,,,#6050,Behmadi 2022,,

We used an obstetric use case, namely electronic fetal monitoring interpretation and decision making, for our assessment.METHODS: This study utilized a mixed methods approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the new, serious game-based training method and assess participants' perceptions of the training. Participants were randomized to traditional simulation training in a center with mannequins or serious game training. They then participated in an obstetrical in-situ simulation scenario to assess their learning. Participants also completed a posttraining perceptions questionnaire.RESULTS: The primary outcome measure for this study was the participants' performance in an in-situ mannequin-based simulation scenario, which occurred posttraining following a washout period. No significant statistical differences were detected between the mannequin-based and serious game-based groups in overall performance, although the study was not sufficiently powered to conclude noninferiority. The survey questions were tested for significant differences in participant perceptions of the educational method, but none were found.

The study was linked to a regular teaching program conducted in August and September 2019. All students participated in a 15-min ABCDE introduction session, before they self-practiced the ABCDE approach for 20 min in either a fully immersive and interactive VR application using hand controllers with some haptic feedback (Individual VR) or with blood pressure gauge, ear-thermometer and oximeter (Individual TP). The primary outcome was the number of students who documented all the eight predefined observations in the ABCDE approach in the correct order in a practical test on an advanced simulator manikin with a time limit of 5 min, done immediately after the self-practice. The predefined one-sided non-inferiority limit was 13% points.RESULTS: Of all eligible students, 84% participated in the study and randomly allocated to VR (n = 149) or TP (n = 140). The primary outcome showed non-inferiority of the VR application with 24.8% in individual VR doing all observations in correct order compared to 27.1% TP (absolute difference 2.3% points, one sided 95% CI 2.3 to 10.8). The secondary outcomes were similar between the groups, but more students in VR reported liking the way they practiced (absolute difference 46% points, 95% CI 36.5 to 56.6) and that it was a good way to learn (36.9% points, 95% CI 26.8 to 47).

Virtual Reality Environments and Haptic Strategies to Enhance Implicit Learning and Motivation in Robot-Assisted Training,"Bernardoni, F.; Ozen, O.; Buetler, K.; Marchal-Crespo, L.","Motivation plays a crucial role in motor learning and neurorehabilitation. Participants ' motivation could decline to a point where they may stop training when facing a very difficult task. Conversely, participants may perform well and consider the training boring if the task is too easy. In this paper, we present a combination of a virtual reality environment with different robotic training strategies that modify task functional difficulty to enhance participants' motivation. We employed a pneumatically driven robotic stepper as a haptic interface. We first evaluated the use of disturbance observers as acceleration controllers to provide high robustness to varying system parameters, unmodeled dynamics and unknown disturbances associated with pneumatic control. The locomotor task to be learned in the virtual reality environment consisted of steering a recumbent bike to follow a desired path by changing the movement frequency of the dominant leg. The motor task was specially designed to engage implicit learning -i.e., learning without conscious recognition of what is learned. A haptic assistance strategy was developed in order to reduce the task functional difficulty during practice. In a feasibility study with eight healthy participants, we found that the haptic assistance provided by the robotic device successfully contributed to improve task performance during training, especially for less skilled participants. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between participants' motivation and performance error when training with haptic assistance, suggesting that haptic assistance has a great potential to enhance motivation during motor training.",2019,,IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics,2019,,760-765,31374722,,,#6089,Bernardoni 2019,,

S.; Nabi, G.","OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to study trainees' feedback and rating of models for training transurethral resection of bladder lesions (TURBT) and prostate (TURP) during simulation.METHODS: The study was performed during the ''Transurethral resection (TUR) module"" at the boot camp held in 2019. Prior to the course, all trainees were required to evaluate their experience in performing TURBT and TURP procedures. Trainees simulated resection on two different models; low-fidelity tissue model (Samed, GmBH, Dresden, Germany) and virtual reality simulator (TURPMentor, 3D Systems, Littleton, US). Following the completion of the module, trainees completed a questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale to evaluate their assessment of the models for surgical training.RESULTS: In total, 174 simulation assessments were performed by 56 trainees (Samed Bladder-40, Prostate-45, TURPMentor Bladder-51, Prostate-37). All trainees reported that they had performed < 50 TUR procedures. The Samed model median scores were for appearance (4/5), texture (5/5), feel (5/5) and conductibility (5/5). The TURPMentor median score was for appearance (4/5), texture and feel (4/5) and conductibility (4/5). The most common criticism of the Samed model was that it failed to mimic bleeding. In contrast, trainees felt that the TURPMentor haptic feedback was inadequate to allow for close resection and did not calibrate movements accurately.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that both forms of simulators (low-fidelity and virtual reality) were rated highly by urology trainees and improve their confidence in performing transurethral resection and in fact complement each other in providing lower tract endoscopic resection simulation.",2021,,World journal of urology,39,8,3103-3107,33394090,,,#6090,Berridge 2021,,

Some of them were required to attend only an online course on RAS, whereas others were asked to achieve threshold scores at VR simulator and participate in a standardized course at a training institute. The attendance to a structured advanced course in RAS showed a significant increase in surgical skills. Our study shows residents in urology are allowed to perform RAS during their residency though the criteria for starting RAS differ significantly amongst the teaching hospitals. To guarantee a basic level of skills and knowledge a structured, (multi-step) training and certification program for RAS should be implemented.",2021,,Journal of Robotic Surgery,15,4,497-510,32772237,,,#6099,Beulens 2021,,
Perspectives of 360-Degree Cinematic Virtual Reality: Interview Study Among Health Care Professionals,"Beverly, E.; Rigot, B.; Love, C.; Love, M.","BACKGROUND: The global market for medical education is projected to increase exponentially over the next 5 years. A mode of delivery expected to drive the growth of this market is virtual reality (VR). VR simulates real-world objects, events, locations, and interactions in 3D multimedia sensory environments. It has been used successfully in medical education for surgical training, learning anatomy, and advancing drug discovery. New VR research has been used to simulate role-playing and clinical encounters; however, most of this research has been conducted with health professions students and not current health care professionals. Thus, more research is needed to explore how health care professionals experience VR with role-playing and clinical encounters.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore health care professionals' experiences with a cinematic VR (cine-VR) training program focused on role-playing and clinical encounters addressing social determinants of health, Appalachian culture, and diabetes. Cine-VR leverages 360-degree video with the narrative storytelling of cinema to create an engaging educational experience.METHODS: We conducted in-depth telephone interviews with health care professionals who participated in the cine-VR training. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. A multidisciplinary team coded and analyzed the data using content and thematic analyses with NVivo software.RESULTS: We conducted 24 in-depth interviews with health care professionals (age=45.3, SD 11.3, years; n=16, 67%, women; n=22, 92%, White; and n=4, 17%, physicians) to explore their experiences with the cine-VR training. Qualitative analysis revealed five themes: immersed in the virtual world: seeing a 360-degree sphere allowed participants to immerse themselves in the virtual world; facilitated knowledge acquisition: all the participants accurately recalled the culture of Appalachia and listed the social determinants of health presented in the training; empathized with multiple perspectives: the cine-VR provided a glimpse into the real life of the main character, and participants described thinking about, feeling, and empathizing with the character's frustrations and disappointments; perceived ease of use of cine-VR: 96% (23/24) of the participants described the cine-VR as easy to use, and they liked the 360-degree movement, image resolution, and sound quality but noted limitations with the buttons on the headsets and risk for motion sickness; and perceived utility of cine-VR as a teaching tool: participants described cine-VR as an effective teaching tool because it activated visual and affective learning for them.CONCLUSIONS: Participants emphasized the realism of the cine-VR training program. They attributed the utility of the cine-VR to visual learning in conjunction with the emotional connection to the VR characters. Furthermore, participants reported that the cine-VR increased their empathy for people. More research is needed to confirm an association between the level of immersion and empathy in cine-VR training for health care professionals.",2022,,JMIR medical education,8,2,e32657,35486427,,,#6102,Beverly 2022,,
Colorectal surgery and enhanced recovery: Impact of a simulation-based care pathway training curriculum,"Beyer-Berjot, L.; Pucher, P.; Patel, V.; Hashimoto, D. A.; Ziprin, P.; Berdah, S.; Darzi, A.; Aggarwal, R.","BACKGROUND: The aim was to determine whether a simulation-based care pathway approach (CPA) curriculum could improve compliance for enhanced recovery programs (ERP), and residents' participation in laparoscopic colorectal surgery (LCS). Indeed, trainee surgeons have limited access to LCS as primary operator, and ERP have improved patients' outcomes in colorectal surgery (CS).METHODS: All residents of our department were trained in a simulation-based CPA: perioperative training consisted in virtual patients built according to guidelines in both ERP and CS, whilst intraoperative training involved a virtual reality simulator curriculum. Twenty consecutive patients undergoing CS were prospectively included before (n=10) and after (n=10) the training. All demographic and perioperative data were prospectively collected, including compliance for ERP. Residents' participation as primary operator in LCS was measured.RESULTS: Five residents (PGY 4-7) were enrolled. None had performed LCS as primary operator. Overall satisfaction and usefulness were both rated 4.5/5, usefulness of pre-, post- and intraoperative training was rated 5/5, 4.5/5 and 4/5, respectively. Residents' participation in LCS significantly improved after the training (0% (0-100) vs. 82.5% (10-100); P=0.006). Pre- and intraoperative data were comparable between groups. Postoperative morbidity was also comparable. Compliance for ERP improved at Day 2 in post-training patients (3 (30%) vs. 8 (80%); P=0.035). Length of stay was not modified.CONCLUSIONS: A simulated CPA curriculum to training in LCS and ERP was correctly implemented. It seemed to improve compliance for ERP, and promoted residents participation as primary operator without adversely altering patients' outcomes.",2017,,Journal of visceral surgery,154,5,313-320,28642083,,,#6104,Beyer-Berjot 2017,"Jeffrey Jacobson (2022-10-14 10:25:27)(Screen): VR for medical training.

"Effectiveness and Utility of Virtual Reality Simulation as an Educational Tool for Safe Performance of COVID-19 Diagnostics: Prospective, Randomized Pilot Trial","Birrenbach, T.; Zbinden, J.; Papagiannakis, G.; Exadaktylos, A. K.; Muller, M.; Hautz, W. E.; Sauter, T. C.","BACKGROUND: Although the proper use of hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) is paramount for preventing the spread of diseases such as COVID-19, health care personnel have been shown to use incorrect techniques for donning/doffing of PPE and hand hygiene, leading to a large number of infections among health professionals. Education and training are difficult owing to the social distancing restrictions in place, shortages of PPE and testing material, and lack of evidence on optimal training. Virtual reality (VR) simulation can offer a multisensory, 3-D, fully immersive, and safe training opportunity that addresses these obstacles.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the short- and long-term effectiveness of a fully immersive VR simulation versus a traditional learning method regarding a COVID-19-related skill set and media-specific variables influencing training outcomes.METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study on medical students (N=29; intervention VR training, n=15, vs control video-based instruction, n=14) to compare the performance of hand disinfection, nasopharyngeal swab taking, and donning/doffing of PPE before and after training and 1 month later as well as variables of media use.RESULTS: Both groups performed significantly better after training, with the effect sustained over one month. After training, the VR group performed significantly better in taking a nasopharyngeal swab, scoring a median of 14 out of 17 points (IQR 13-15) versus 12 out of 17 points (IQR 11-14) in the control group, P=.03. With good immersion and tolerability of the VR simulation, satisfaction was significantly higher in the VR group compared to the control group (median score of User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire 27/30, IQR 23-28, vs 22/30, IQR 20-24, in the control group; P=.01).CONCLUSIONS: VR simulation was at least as effective as traditional learning methods in training medical students while providing benefits regarding user satisfaction. These results add to the growing body of evidence that VR is a useful tool for acquiring simple and complex clinical skills.",2021,,JMIR Serious Games,9,4,e29586,34623315,,,#6129,Birrenbach 2021,,
The Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool Global Rating Scale is a Valid and Reliable Adjunct Measure of Performance on a Virtual Reality Simulator for Hip Arthroscopy,"Bishop, M. E.; Ode, G. E.; Hurwit, D. J.; Zmugg, S.; Rauck, R. C.; Nguyen, J. T.; Ranawat, A. S.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the construct validity and interobserver reliability of a hip arthroscopy virtual simulator using the Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET) global rating scale.METHODS: Thirty participants (23 male/7 female) completed a diagnostic arthroscopy and a loose body retrieval simulation on the VirtaMed Arthros Hip Simulator (Zurich, Switzerland) twice at a minimum of 1 week apart. Subjects consisted of 12 novices (medical students, postgraduate year [PGY] 1-2), 5 intermediate trainees (PGY3-4), 9 senior trainees (PGY5 and fellows), and 4 attending faculty. Simulator metrics were recorded and then compiled to generate a total simulator score (TSS). The loose body retrieval was graded using the ASSET scoring tool. Inter-rater and intrarater reliability for the ASSET for 2 blinded raters and construct validity of the ASSET and the TSS were calculated. Correlation between the TSS, ASSET and individual simulator metrics was determined.RESULTS: Prior simulation experience (P <= 0.01) correlated with higher TSS and higher ASSET, while video game experience correlated with higher TSS on the diagnostic module only (P = 0.004). There was a significant difference in ASSET score among all experience groups (P < 0.04). Novices had the lowest mean ASSET whereas experts had the highest mean ASSET with a difference of 17.4 points. Overall performance on the surgical module significantly correlated with the ASSET score (r = 0.444, P = 0.016). There was a significant positive correlation among higher ASSET and number of loose bodies retrieved, operation time, camera path and grasper path length, and percentage of cartilage injury. ASSET demonstrated excellent intrarater reliability and showed substantial or better inter-reliability in 8 of 9 domains.CONCLUSION: The VirtaMed hip arthroscopy simulator demonstrated good construct validity and excellent reliability for simulator-based metrics and ASSET score. Use of both simulator metrics and ASSET offers a more comprehensive performance assessment on hip arthroscopy simulation than either measure alone.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As virtual reality simulation for arthroscopy becomes more commonplace in orthopaedic training, evaluation of the most effective objective and subjective measures of performance is necessary to optimize simulation training.",2021,,Arthroscopy,37,6,1856-1866,33539979,,,#6131,Bishop 2021,,
Evaluation of Procedural Simulation as a Training and Assessment Tool in General Surgery-Simulating a Laparoscopic Appendectomy,"Bjerrum, F.; Strandbygaard, J.; Rosthoj, S.; Grantcharov, T.; Ottesen, B.; Sorensen, J. L.","BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic appendectomy is a commonly performed surgical procedure, but few training models have been described for it. We examined a virtual reality module for practising a laparoscopic appendectomy.METHODS: A prospective cohort study with the following 3 groups of surgeons (n = 45): novices (0 procedures), intermediates (10-50 procedures), and experienced (>100 procedures). After being introduced to the simulator and 1 familiarization attempt on the procedural module, the participants practiced the module 20 times. Movements, task time, and procedure-specific parameters were compared over time.RESULTS: The time and movement parameters were significantly different during the first attempt, and more experienced surgeons used fewer movements and less time than novices (p < 0.01), although only 2 parameters were significantly different between novices and intermediates. All 3 groups improved significantly over 20 attempts (p < 0.0001). The intraclass correlation coefficient varied between 0.55 and 0.68 and did not differ significantly between the 3 groups (p > 0.05). When comparing novices with experienced surgeons, novices had a higher risk of burn damage to cecum (odds ratio [OR] = 3.0 [95% CI: 1.3; 7.0] p = 0.03), pressure damage to appendix (OR = 3.1 [95% CI: 2.0; 4.9] p < 0.0001), and grasping of the appendix (OR = 2.9 [95% CI: 1.8; 4.7] p < 0.0001). The risk of causing a perforation was not significantly different among the different experience levels (OR = 1.9 [95% CI: 0.9; 3.8] p = 0.14). Only 3 out of 5 error parameters differed significantly when comparing novices and experienced surgeons. Similarly, when comparing intermediates and novices, it was only 2 of the parameters that differed.DISCUSSION: The simulator module for practising laparoscopic appendectomy may be useful as a training tool, but further development is required before it can be used for assessment purposes. Procedural simulation may demonstrate more variation for movement parameters, and future research should focus on developing better procedure-specific parameters.",2017,,Journal of Surgical Education,74,2,243-250,27717707,,,#6134,Bjerrum 2017,,

P.","PURPOSE: To describe results of a study evaluating a Projected Augmented Reality (P-AR) system for its potential to enhance nursing education about pressure injuries.DESIGN: Pilot evaluation survey.SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised nursing students and faculty at a school of nursing in a large, Midwestern public university. A total of 32 participants, which included 27 students (30% BSN, 44% MN, and 26% DNP students; 81% female) and 5 faculty members (80% female) participated.METHODS: The P-AR system was prototyped using commercial-off-the-shelf components and software algorithms, applied to pressure injury nursing education content. After interaction with the P-AR system, participants completed a survey evaluating the following features of the P-AR system for potential: engagement, effectiveness, usefulness, user-friendliness, and realism, and users' overall impression and satisfaction with system features. Evaluation statements used a 5-level Likert-scale; open-ended questions about what was liked, disliked, or anything else offered opportunity for comments.RESULTS: Student and faculty median evaluation scores were 5 (strongly agree or very satisfied) and 4 (agree or satisfied) for nearly all evaluation and satisfaction statements. Students' satisfaction with ""realism"" received a median score of 3 (neutral). The P-AR system was refined to include realistic still and animated images.CONCLUSION: The P-AR system, an innovative technology using 3-dimensional dynamic images, was applied to nursing education content about pressure injury and was evaluated as having potential to enhance pressure injury teaching and learning.

Virtual Standardized Patient Simulation: Case Development and Pilot Application to High-Value Care,"Bond, W. F.; Lynch, T. J.; Mischler, M. J.; Fish, J. L.; McGarvey, J. S.; Taylor, J. T.; Kumar, D. M.; Mou, K. M.; Ebert-Allen, R. A.; Mahale, D. N.; Talbot, T. B.; Aiyer, M.","INTRODUCTION: High-value care (HVC) suggests that good history taking and physical examination should lead to risk stratification that drives the use or withholding of diagnostic testing. This study describes the development of a series of virtual standardized patient (VSP) cases and provides preliminary evidence that supports their ability to provide experiential learning in HVC.METHODS: This pilot study used VSPs, or natural language processing-based patient avatars, within the USC Standard Patient platform. Faculty consensus was used to develop the cases, including the optimal diagnostic testing strategies, treatment options, and scored content areas. First-year resident physician learners experienced two 90-minute didactic sessions before completing the cases in a computer laboratory, using typed text to interview the avatar for history taking, then completing physical examination, differential diagnosis, diagnostic testing, and treatment modules for each case. Learners chose a primary and 2 alternative ""possible"" diagnoses from a list of 6 to 7 choices, diagnostic testing options from an extensive list, and treatments from a brief list ranging from 6 to 9 choices. For the history-taking module, both faculty and the platform scored the learners, and faculty assessed the appropriateness of avatar responses. Four randomly selected learner-avatar interview transcripts for each case were double rated by faculty for interrater reliability calculations. Intraclass correlations were calculated for interrater reliability, and Spearman rho was used to determine the correlation between the platform and faculty ranking of learners' history-taking scores.RESULTS: Eight VSP cases were experienced by 14 learners. Investigators reviewed 112 transcripts (4646 learner query-avatar responses). Interrater reliability means were 0.87 for learner query scoring and 0.83 for avatar response. Mean learner success for history taking was scored by the faculty at 57% and by the platform at 51% (rho correlation of learner rankings = 0.80, P = 0.02). The mean avatar appropriate response rate was 85.6% for all cases. Learners chose the correct diagnosis within their 3 choices 82% of the time, ordered a median (interquartile range) of 2 (2) unnecessary tests and completed 56% of optimal treatments.CONCLUSIONS: Our avatar appropriate response rate was similar to past work using similar platforms. The simulations give detailed insights into the thoroughness of learner history taking and testing choices and with further refinement should support learning in HVC.",2019,,Simulation in Healthcare: The Journal of The Society for Medical Simulation,14,4,241-250,31116172,,,#6156,Bond 2019,,
The Effectiveness of Collaborative Augmented Reality in Gross Anatomy Teaching: A Quantitative and Qualitative Pilot Study,"Bork, F.; Lehner, A.; Eck, U.; Navab, N.; Waschke, J.; Kugelmann, D.","In the context of gross anatomy education, novel augmented reality (AR) systems have the potential to serve as complementary pedagogical tools and facilitate interactive, student-centered learning. However, there is a lack of AR systems that enable multiple students to engage in collaborative, team-based learning environments. This article presents the results of a pilot study in which first-year medical students (n = 16) had the opportunity to work with such a collaborative AR system during a full-day gross anatomy seminar. Student performance in an anatomy knowledge test, conducted after an extensive group learning session, increased significantly compared to a pre-test in both the experimental group working with the collaborative AR system (P < 0.01) and in the control group working with traditional anatomy atlases and three-dimensional (3D) models (P < 0.01). However, no significant differences were found between the test results of both groups. While the experienced mental effort during the collaborative learning session was considered rather high (5.13 +/- 2.45 on a seven-point Likert scale), both qualitative and quantitative feedback during a survey as well as the results of a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire (80.00 +/- 13.90) outlined the potential of the collaborative AR system for increasing students' 3D understanding of topographic anatomy and its advantages over comparable AR systems for single-user experiences. Overall, these outcomes show that collaborative AR systems such as the one evaluated within this work stimulate interactive, student-centered learning in teams and have the potential to become an integral part of a modern, multi-modal anatomy curriculum.",2021,,Anatomical sciences education,14,5,590-604,32892494,,,#6164,Bork 2021,,
The Benefits of an Augmented Reality Magic Mirror System for Integrated Radiology Teaching in Gross Anatomy,"Bork, F.; Stratmann, L.; Enssle, S.; Eck, U.; Navab, N.; Waschke, J.; Kugelmann, D.","Early exposure to radiological cross-section images during introductory anatomy and dissection courses increases students' understanding of both anatomy and radiology. Novel technologies such as augmented reality (AR) offer unique advantages for an interactive and hands-on integration with the student at the center of the learning experience. In this article, the benefits of a previously proposed AR Magic Mirror system are compared to the Anatomage, a virtual dissection table as a system for combined anatomy and radiology teaching during a two-semester gross anatomy course with 749 first-year medical students, as well as a follow-up elective course with 72 students. During the former, students worked with both systems in dedicated tutorial sessions which accompanied the anatomy lectures and provided survey-based feedback. In the elective course, participants were assigned to three groups and underwent a self-directed learning session using either Anatomage, Magic Mirror, or traditional radiology atlases. A pre- and posttest design with multiple choice questions revealed significant improvements in test scores between the two tests for both the Magic Mirror and the group using radiology atlases, while no significant differences in test scores were recorded for the Anatomage group. Furthermore, especially students with low mental rotation test (MRT) scores benefited from the Magic Mirror and Anatomage and achieved significantly higher posttest scores compared to students with a low MRT score in the theory group. Overall, the results provide supporting evidence that the Magic Mirror system achieves comparable results in terms of learning outcome to established anatomy learning tools such as Anatomage and radiology atlases.",2019,,Anatomical sciences education,12,6,585-598,30697948,,,#6165,Bork 2019,,

Developing Innovative Virtual Reality Simulations to Increase Health Care Providers' Understanding of Social Determinants of Health,"Brammer, S. V.; Regan, S. L.; Collins, C. M.; Gillespie, G. L.","INTRODUCTION: Health care providers (HCPs) who work primarily with Medicaid patients must be competent in identifying and addressing social determinants of health (SDH). A curricular gap exists between promoting an understanding of SDH and teaching HCPs how to recognize and increase empathy to manage them. The project aim was to develop two virtual reality simulations (VRSs) as innovative methods to teach HCPs to identify and manage SDH. A secondary aim was to decrease unconscious bias and increase empathy by experiencing SDH from their patients' perspective.METHODS: Scripts for two VRSs were created by two HCP educators and clinicians. Scripts were evaluated by experts using an index of content validity (CVI). An advisory panel critiqued the scripts for appropriateness for VRSs, adequacy of evidence-based practice, and use of VRS equipment and software. The panel participated in a focus group and completed a final evaluation. The VRSs then were pilot tested with five HCPs who assessed content and utility and participated in interviews. This led to iterative improvements. Qualitative data were analyzed using a content analysis approach.RESULTS: The VRS scripts demonstrated adequate content-related validity evidence with CVI scores of 0.81 and 0.75. The expert panel found the VRS easy to use, useful as an educational tool, while promoting empathy for patients. Overall, participants were satisfied with using the VRS as an educational experience.DISCUSSION: Through VRS technology, this project addresses a curricular gap in HCP training on SDH. VRS can be a useful tool to increase HCPs' understanding of SDH and, potentially, their empathy for patients.",2022,,Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions,42,1,60-65,34799522,,,#6191,Brammer 2022,,

Trainees rated the models using 5-point Likert scales evaluating the domains of anatomy, instrument handling, procedural content, and the overall fidelity of the simulation. Paired t tests were performed for each domain's mean overall score and individual items.RESULTS: The VR model has relative benefits compared with the physical model with respect to realistic representation of intraventricular anatomy at the foramen of Monro (4.5, standard deviation [SD] = 0.7 vs 4.1, SD = 0.6; P = .04) and the third ventricle floor (4.4, SD = 0.6 vs 4.0, SD = 0.9; P = .03), although the overall anatomy score was similar (4.2, SD = 0.6 vs 4.0, SD = 0.6; P = .11).

Battle of the bots: a comparison of the standard da Vinci and the da Vinci Surgical Skills Simulator in surgical skills acquisition,"Brown, K.; Mosley, N.; Tierney, J.","Virtual reality simulators are increasingly used to gain robotic surgical skills. This study compared use of the da Vinci Surgical Skills Simulator (dVSSS) to the standard da Vinci (SdV) robot for skills acquisition in a prospective randomized study. Residents from urology, gynecology, and general surgery programs performed three virtual reality tasks (thread the ring, ring rail, and tubes) on the dvSSS. Participants were then randomized to one of the two study groups (dVSSS and SdV). Each participant then practiced on either the dVSSS or the SdV (depending on randomization) for 30 min per week over a 4-week time period. The dVSSS arm was not permitted to practice ring rail (due to no similar practice scenario available for the SdV group). Following 4 weeks of practice, participants performed the same three virtual reality tasks and the results were recorded and compared to baseline. Overall and percent improvement were recorded for all participants from pre-test to post-test. Two-way ANOVA analyses were used to compare the dVSSS and SdV groups and three tasks. Initially, 30 participants were identified and enrolled in the study. Randomization resulted in 15 participants in each arm. During the course of the study, four participants were unable to complete all tasks and practice sessions and were, therefore, excluded. This resulted in a total of 26 participants (15 in the dVSSS group and 11 in the SdV group) who completed the study. Overall total improvement score was found to be 23.23 and 23.48 for the SdV and dVSSS groups, respectively (p = 0.9245). The percent improvement was 60 and 47 % for the SdV and dVSSS groups respectively, which was a statistically significant difference between the two groups and three tasks. Practicing on the standard da Vinci is comparable to practicing on the da Vinci simulator for acquiring robotic surgical skills. In spite of several potential advantages, the dVSSS arm performed no better than the SdV arm in the final assessment of participant scores. Our findings indicate that both the SdV and dVSSS can be beneficial to residents in improving their robotic surgery skills.",2017,,Journal of Robotic Surgery,11,2,159-162,27573786,,,#6214,Brown 2017,,
Observing the stages of bystander intervention in virtual reality simulation,"Buckler, D. G.; Almodovar, A.; Snobelen, P.; Abella, B. S.; Blewer, A.; Leary, M.","BACKGROUND: Understanding bystander reactions to an emergency is an important component of effective training. Four stages of bystander intervention (BI) have been previously described: noticing the situation as a problem, interpreting when it is appropriate to intervene, recognizing personal responsibility to intervene, and knowing how to intervene. Using virtual reality (VR) to simulate emergencies such as sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) can be used to study these stages.METHODS: In a secondary analysis of an observational cohort study, we analyzed bystander self-efficacy for stages of BI before and after simulated SCA. Each subject participated in a single-player, immersive, VR SCA scenario. Subjects interacted with simulated bystanders through voice commands (""call 911"", ""get an AED""). Actions taken in scenario, like performing CPR, were documented. Scenario BI actions were compared based on dichotomized comfort/discomfort.RESULTS: From June 2016 to June 2017, 119 subjects participated. Average age was 37+/-14 years, 44% were female and 46% reported CPR training within 2 years. During the scenario, 98% ""noticed the event"" and ""interpreted it as a problem"", 78% ""took responsibility"", and 54% ""possessed the necessary skills"". Self-efficacy increased from pre- to post-scenario: noticing the event increased from 80% to 96%; interpreting as a problem increased from 86% to 97%; taking responsibility increased from 56% to 93%; possessing necessary skills increased from 47% to 63% (P<0.001).CONCLUSION: Self-efficacy to respond to an SCA event increased pre- to post-scenario. Bystanders who reported feeling comfortable ""taking responsibility to intervene"" during an emergency were more likely to take action during a simulated emergency.",2019,,World Journal of Emergency Medicine,10,3,145-151,31171944,,,#6228,Buckler 2019,,
Effect of Continuous Motion Parameter Feedback on Laparoscopic Simulation Training: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial on Skill Acquisition and Retention,"Buescher, J. F.; Mehdorn, A. S.; Neumann, P. A.; Becker, F.; Eichelmann, A. K.; Pankratius, U.; Bahde, R.; Foell, D.; Senninger, N.; Rijcken, E.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of motion parameter feedback on laparoscopic basic skill acquisition and retention during a standardized box training curriculum.DESIGN: A Lap-X Hybrid laparoscopic simulator was designed to provide individual and continuous motion parameter feedback in a dry box trainer setting. In a prospective controlled trial, surgical novices were randomized into 2 groups (regular box group, n = 18, and Hybrid group, n = 18) to undergo an identical 5-day training program. In each group, 7 standardized tasks on laparoscopic basic skills were completed twice a day on 4 consecutive days in fixed pairs. Additionally, each participant performed a simulated standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy before (day 1) and after training (day 5) on a LAP Mentor II virtual reality (VR) trainer, allowing an independent control of skill progress in both groups. A follow-up assessment of skill retention was performed after 6 weeks with repetition of both the box tasks and VR cholecystectomy.SETTING: Muenster University Hospital Training Center, Muenster, Germany.PARTICIPANTS: Medical students without previous surgical experience.RESULTS: Laparoscopic skills in both groups improved significantly during the training period, measured by the overall task performance time. The 6 week follow-up showed comparable skill retention in both groups. Evaluation of the VR cholecystectomies demonstrated significant decrease of operation time (p < 0.01), path length of the left and right instrument, and the number of movements of the left and right instruments for the Hybrid group (all p < 0.001), compared to the box group. Similar results were found at the assessment of skill retention.CONCLUSION: Simulation training on both trainers enables reliable acquisition of laparoscopic basic skills. Furthermore, individual and continuous motion feedback improves laparoscopic skill enhancement significantly in several aspects. Thus, training systems with feedback of motion parameters should be considered to achieve long-term improvement of motion economy among surgical trainees.",2018,,Journal of Surgical Education,75,2,516-526,28864265,,,#6232,Buescher 2018,,
Evaluation of Vaccination Training in Pharmacy Curriculum: Preparing Students for Workforce Needs,"Bushell, M.; Frost, J.; Deeks, L.; Kosari, S.; Hussain, Z.; Naunton, M.","BACKGROUND: To introduce and evaluate a university vaccination training program, preparing final year Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) and Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) students to administer vaccinations to children and adults in community pharmacy and offsite (mobile and outreach) settings.METHODS: Final year BPharm and MPharm students were trained to administer intramuscular vaccinations to adults and children. The education program embedded in pharmacy degree curriculum was congruent with the requirements of the Australian National Immunisation Education Framework. The training used a mix of pedagogies including online learning; interactive lectures; and simulation, which included augmented reality and role play. All pharmacy students completing the program in 2019 were required to carry out pre- and post-knowledge assessments. Student skill of vaccination was assessed using an objective structured clinical assessment rubric. Students were invited to complete pre and post questionnaires on confidence. The post questionnaire incorporated student evaluation of learning experience questions.RESULTS: In both cohorts, student vaccination knowledge increased significantly after the completion of the vaccination training program; pre-intervention and post-intervention mean knowledge score (SD) of BPharm and MPharm were (14.3 +/- 2.7 vs. 22.7 +/- 3.3; p < 0.001) and (15.7 +/- 2.9 vs. 21.4 +/- 3.2; p < 0.001) respectively. There was no difference between the BPharm and MPharm in the overall knowledge test scores, (p = 0.81; p = 0.95) pre and post scores respectively. Using the OSCA rubric, all students (n = 52) were identified as competent in the skill of injection and could administer an IM deltoid injection to a child and adult mannequin. Students agreed that the training increased their self-confidence to administer injections to both children and adults. Students found value in the use of mixed reality to enhance student understanding of the anatomy of injection sites.CONCLUSION: The developed vaccination training program improved both student knowledge and confidence. Pharmacy students who complete such training should be able to administer vaccinations to children and adults, improving workforce capability. Mixed reality in the education of pharmacy students can be used to improve student satisfaction and enhance learning.",2020,,Pharmacy : A Journal Of Pharmacy Education And Practice,8,3,20,32825470,,,#6244,Bushell 2020,,
A virtual reality methodology for cardiopulmonary resuscitation training with and without a physical mannequin,"Buttussi, F.; Chittaro, L.; Valent, F.","BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency procedure that can increase survival after a cardiac arrest. Performing CPR effectively requires both procedural knowledge and manual skills. Traditional CPR training methodology includes lessons led by instructors and supervised practice on mannequins, thus requiring considerable resources.OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes a new methodology for low-cost CPR training based on virtual reality (VR) with and without the addition of a physical mannequin. Moreover, it describes an experimental evaluation of the methodology that assessed gain in manual skills during training, transfer of procedural knowledge and manual skills in a final assessment, and changes in self-efficacy with three measurements over time (pre-training, post-training, and post-assessment).METHODS: We implemented a VR application that supports the proposed methodology, and can thus be used with or without a mannequin. The experimental evaluation involved 30 participants who tried CPR in VR twice, performing two repetitions of 30 chest compressions per trial. Half participants tried the VR application with the mannequin and half without it. Final assessment required all participants to perform CPR on the mannequin without the assistance of VR. To assess self-efficacy, participants filled in a questionnaire at the three times of measurement.RESULTS: Mixed-design ANOVAs showed effects of repetition, effects of group, or interaction between the two variables on manual skills assessed during training. In the final assessment, participants in both groups correctly remembered most of the steps of the procedure. ANOVAs revealed differences between the two groups only in pressure-related skills (better with mannequin) and in the number of wrong steps added to the procedure (better without mannequin). Mixed-design ANOVA showed a self-efficacy increase in both groups after training, which was maintained after final assessment.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed VR methodology for CPR training has a positive effect on procedural knowledge, manual skills, and self-efficacy, with as well as without the physical mannequin. Trials on a mannequin are required to understand the correct pressure for chest compression. This supports the adoption of the proposed VR methodology to reduce instructor and mannequin time required to teach CPR to trainees.",2020,,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,111,,103590,33039589,,,#6249,Buttussi 2020,,
Assessing the Value of Endoscopy Simulator Modules Designed to Prepare Residents for the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery Examination,"Byrne, R. M.; Hoops, H. E.; Herzig, D. O.; Diamond, S. J.; Lu, K. C.; Brasel, K. J.; Tsikitis, V. L.","BACKGROUND: The Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery examination is required for all general surgery residents. The test modules are not available for practice before the examination; however, similar modules are commercially available.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine which modules are most valuable for resident training and preparation for the examination by evaluating which correlates best with experience level.DESIGN: This was a single-institution study.SETTING: A virtual reality endoscopy simulator was utilized.PARTICIPANTS: General surgery residents and faculty endoscopists performed endoscopy simulator modules (Endobasket 2, Endobubble 1 and 2, Mucosal Evaluation 2, and Basic Navigation) designed to prepare residents for the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery examination. Residents were assigned into junior and senior groups based on the completion of a dedicated endoscopy rotation.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were the mean time to completion, mean number of balloons popped, and mean number of wall hits for the 3 groups.RESULTS: A total of 21 junior residents, 11 senior residents, and 3 faculty participated. There were significant differences among groups in the mean time to completion for the Endobasket, Endobubble, and Mucosal Evaluation modules. The modules that correlated best with experience level were Endobubble 2 and Mucosal Evaluation 2. For Endobubble 2, juniors were slower than seniors, who were in turn slower than faculty (junior 118.8 +/- 20.55 seconds, senior 100.3 +/- 11.78 seconds, faculty 87.67 +/- 2.848 seconds; p < 0.01). Juniors popped fewer balloons than seniors, who popped fewer balloons than faculty (junior 9.441 +/- 3.838, senior 15.62 +/- 4.133, faculty 28.78 +/- 1.712; p < 0.001). For Mucosal Evaluation 2, juniors were slower than seniors, who were in turn slower than faculty (junior 468.8 +/- 123.5 seconds, senior 368.6 +/- 63.42 seconds, faculty 233.1 +/- 70.45 seconds; p < 0.01).LIMITATIONS: Study residents have not completed the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery examinations, so correlation with examination performance is not yet possible.CONCLUSIONS: Performance on Endobasket, Endobubble, and Mucosal Evaluation correlated well with experience level, providing benchmarks for each level to attain in preparation for the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery examination.

"The Effect of Training, Used-Hand, and Experience on Endoscopic Surgery Skills in an Educational Computer-Based Simulation Environment (ECE) for Endoneurosurgery Training","Cagiltay, N. E.; Ozcelik, E.; Isikay, I.; Hanalioglu, S.; Suslu, A. E.; Yucel, T.; Berker, M.","Today, virtual simulation environments create alternative hands-on practice opportunities for surgical training. In order to increase the potential benefits of such environments, it is critical to understand the factors that influence them. This study was conducted to determine the effects of training, used-hand, and experience, as well as the interactions between these variables, on endoscopic surgery skills in an educational computer-based surgical simulation environment. A 2-hour computer-based endoneurosurgery simulation training module was developed for this study. Thirty-one novice- and intermediate-level resident surgeons from the departments of neurosurgery and ear, nose, and throat participated in this experimental study. The results suggest that a 2-hour training during a 2-month period through computer-based simulation environment improves the surgical skills of the residents in both-hand tasks, which is necessary for endoscopic surgical procedures but not in dominant hand tasks. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that computer-based simulation environments potentially improve surgical skills; however, the scenarios for such training modules need to consider especially the bimanual coordination of hands and should be regularly adapted to the individual skill levels and progresses.",2019,,Surgical Innovation,26,6,725-737,31370743,,,#6256,Cagiltay 2019,,
Improving Resident Performance in Knee Arthroscopy: A Prospective Value Assessment of Simulators and Cadaveric Skills Laboratories,"Camp, C. L.; Krych, A. J.; Stuart, M. J.; Regnier, T. D.; Mills, K. M.; Turner, N. S.","BACKGROUND: Cadaveric skills laboratories and virtual reality simulators are two common methods used outside of the operating room to improve residents' performance of knee arthroscopy. We are not aware of any head-to-head comparisons of the educational values of these two methodologies. The purpose of this prospective randomized trial was to assess the efficacy of these training methods, compare their rates of improvement, and provide economic value data to programs seeking to implement such technologies.METHODS: Orthopaedic surgery residents were randomized to one of three groups: control, training on cadavera (cadaver group), and training with use of a simulator (simulator group). Residents completed pretest and posttest diagnostic knee arthroscopies on cadavera that were timed and video-recorded. Between the pretest and posttest, the control group performed no arthroscopy, the cadaver group performed four hours of practice on cadavera, and the simulator group trained for four hours on a simulator. All tests were scored in a blinded, randomized fashion using the validated Arthroscopy Surgical Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET). The mean improvement in the ASSET score and in the time to complete the procedure were compared between the pretest and posttest and among the groups.RESULTS: Forty-five residents (fifteen per group) completed the study. The mean difference in the ASSET score from the pretest to the posttest was -0.40 (p = 0.776) in the control group, +4.27 (p = 0.002) in the cadaver group, and +1.92 (p = 0.096) in the simulator group (p = 0.015 for the comparison among the groups). The mean difference in the test-completion time (minutes:seconds) from the pretest to the posttest was 0:07 (p = 0.902) in the control group, 3:01 (p = 0.002) in the cadaver group, and 0:28 (p = 0.708) in the simulator group (p = 0.044 for the comparison among groups). Residents in the cadaver group improved their performance at a mean of 1.1 ASSET points per hour spent training whereas those in the simulator group improved 0.5 ASSET point per hour of training.CONCLUSIONS: Cadaveric skills laboratories improved residents' performance of knee arthroscopy compared with that of matched controls. Residents practicing on cadaveric specimens improved twice as fast as those utilizing a high-fidelity simulator; however, based on cost estimation specific to our institution, the simulator may be more cost-effective if it is used at least 300 hours per year. Additional study of this possibility is warranted.",2016,,Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery - American Volume,98,3,220-5,26842412,,,#6279,Camp 2016,,

The Impact of Virtual Reality Exposure on Stress Level and Sense of Competence in Ambulance Workers,"Chaabane, S.; Etienne, A. M.; Schyns, M.; Wagener, A.","Virtual reality (VR) exposure is used in clinical psychology to treat anxiety disorders. It is also used to enhance resilience in soldiers by allowing them to confront virtual combat environments to help fortify them against the negative consequences of trauma exposure. Most VR studies have focused on military and emergency medical staff; however, thus far, none have investigated VR in ambulance workers (AWs), who are confronted with traumatic situations daily. The current study aimed to assess the impact of a single VR exposure session on self-perceived competence and stress level in a sample of AWs. Participants (N = 40) were randomly assigned to either a VR immersion (i.e., experimental group, n = 20) or an audio immersion (i.e., control group, n = 20) of a shooting attack situation. We hypothesized that compared to controls, VR participants would report decreased anxiety, as measured using visual analog scales, as well as an increased sense of competence. The results showed a significant reduction in fear in both groups, d = 0.33, and an increased sense of competence in VR participants, d = 0.35. Although our hypotheses were only partially confirmed, the observed beneficial effects of VR and the audio immersion on stress levels in AWs suggest that VR exposure could be a useful way to increase resilience in AWs.",2022,,Journal of traumatic stress,35,1,120-127,34213794,,,#6332,Chaabane 2022,,
The role of smartphone game applications in improving laparoscopic skills,"Chalhoub, M.; Khazzaka, A.; Sarkis, R.; Sleiman, Z.","BACKGROUND: Virtual games (VGs) have a positive impact on laparoscopic skills. Time spent playing, the console and the type of game used correlate with the speed of acquisition of laparoscopic skills and their preservation.METHODS: A total of 45 university medical students with no previous surgical experience were divided into three groups: gamers (n=20), control (n=10) and intervention (n=15). They passed the laparoscopic skills testing and training model, developed by the European Academy of Gynecological Surgery, over two sessions. Every 5 intervention participants were asked to play a different smartphone application game daily for 2 months between the two sessions. Scores were calculated at both sessions and used to calculate the evolution ratio between sessions.RESULTS: Significant advantage was found at session 1 of gamers over non-gamers (p=0.002). No significant difference existed between the two non-gamer groups (p=0.96), or between the three intervention sub-groups (p>0.05). All participants' performances improved between sessions. No significant difference existed in evolution between control and gamers (p=0.121), nor between intervention and gamers (p=0.189). Significant advantage was found in evolutions of the intervention group over control group (p=0.035).CONCLUSION: Previous VG experience is a significant factor in showing better laparoscopic skills when virtual reality simulator is used for the first time. Recent and regular smartphone gaming practice significantly improves laparoscopic skills in non-gamers independently of the type of game practiced. Smartphone gaming practice appears to influence positively some specific laparoscopic skills more than others.",2018,,Advances in Medical Education & Practice,9,,541-547,30123018,,,#6338,Chalhoub 2018,,
Virtual reality teaching in chemotherapy administration: Randomised controlled trial,"Chan, H. Y.; Chang, H. C.; Huang, T. W.","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of virtual reality (VR)-based documents (VRdocs) on knowledge and attitude towards chemotherapy administration in nursing students.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer patients are a complicated and dangerous process. However, despite the high toxicity of the chemotherapeutic drugs, the compulsory or internship courses in nursing schools do not include training in operational chemotherapeutics and its associated safety measures.DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial based on the CONSORT 2010 guidelines (registry number: NCT03707210).METHOD: A total of 77 students were randomised to an experimental (VRdocs, n = 38) or a control group (n = 39). Pre- and posttest data were collected. After the pretest, the control group received the education documents, whereas, the experimental group used VR software consisting of an application about chemotherapy administration. Finally, the effectiveness of the intervention was self-evaluated using questionnaires after 7 days.RESULTS: The posttest scores for knowledge (F = 6.412, p = .013) and attitude in the experimental group were significantly different from those in the control group (F = 8.469, p = .005). Compared with the control group, a significant number of students in the experimental group indicated their higher recommendation score for the VRdocs (p = .0001).CONCLUSION: Schools must provide a variety of handouts and teaching methods to educate nursing students about high-risk nursing techniques. Methods using VR can address the shortcomings of the traditional documents, and the use of both methods simultaneously can produce better learning results.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Virtual reality based documents were provided to the participants to understand the preparation, implementation, and safety of chemotherapy.

Virtual reality informative aids increase residents' atrial fibrillation ablation procedures-related knowledge and patients' satisfaction,"Chang, S. L.; Kuo, M. J.; Lin, Y. J.; Chen, S. A.; Yang, Y. Y.; Cheng, H. M.; Yang, L. Y.; Kao, S. Y.; Lee, F. Y.","BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and increasing numbers of patients receive AF ablation nowadays. Therefore, in the cardiology division, residents need to be familiar with the AF ablation procedure-related knowledge for primary care. This study evaluated the baseline residents and patients' self-efficacy to the AF ablation procedure-related knowledge, developed the specific virtual reality (VR) informative aids, and evaluated the effects of VR training and resident-led VR aids-based patient education on their self-efficacy, in the aspects of familiarity, confidence and anxiety, and satisfaction.METHODS: From 2019, April to 2020, April, this 1-year prospective prestudy and poststudy was undergone in the cardiology division. Between 2019, April and 2019, December, the experienced physicians were invited to develop VR informative aids for AF ablation procedure-related knowledge. Between January 2020 and April 2020, newly developed VR informative aids were implemented in the educational program of training rotated residents for giving patient education.RESULT: A total of 20 residents and 32 patients were enrolled. The baseline self-reported self-efficacy and knowledge scores were relatively low among rotated residents and their patients. In addition to the high level of satisfaction, self-efficacy and knowledge scores of residents and their patients were increased after VR aids-based training and resident-led patient education. Higher degree of improvement in self-efficacy was noted among patients with depression/anxiety history than those without history. The follow-up assessments among residents showed that the positive effects of VR aids were sustained until 2 weeks later.CONCLUSION: Overall, residents and patients reported that the VR aids increase the effectiveness of patient education, achieve the purpose of a paperless environment, and motivate them to recommend it to others.

Comparisons of Stress Physiology of Providers in Real-Life Resuscitations and Virtual Reality-Simulated Resuscitations,"Chang, T. P.; Beshay, Y.; Hollinger, T.; Sherman, J. M.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is a promising simulation medium for high-stakes, low-frequency events such as pediatric resuscitation. The psychological fidelity of VR compared with a real resuscitation in an emergency department (ED) is relatively unknown. The objective was to determine whether stress physiology changes were equivalent between ED and VR resuscitations.METHODS: This was a single-site pilot equivalence study evaluating head-mounted VR resuscitation scenarios using board-certified/eligible pediatric ED physicians. Subjects had heart rates (HRs) and salivary cortisol levels recorded throughout 8-hour evening ED shifts and during one 1-hour VR session. Additional samples and subjective workload perception (NASA Task Load Index) were collected for critical resuscitations. A delta HR and delta cortisol level described the difference in mean HR and mean cortisol level between shifts with and shifts without resuscitations. Another delta calculation was performed from pre-VR to post-VR. Nonparametric univariate statistics was examined for significant differences in delta HR or cortisol levels between the ED setting and VR.RESULTS: Sixteen subjects had 69 shifts monitored with 31 resuscitations. In the ED, delta HR was +13.9 bpm (P < 0.001) and delta cortisol was +0.10 mug/dL (P = 0.006). In VR, delta HR was +6.5 bpm (P < 0.001) but minimal delta cortisol (-0.02 mug/dL, P = 0.05). Emergency department resuscitations both HR and cortisol levels were more than VR resuscitations (P < 0.03). NASA Task Load Index scores were higher in VR resuscitations with +26 score difference (P = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality resuscitations increase HR but show less stress physiology changes than ED resuscitations within an actual 8-hour shift.

We further describe deliberate game mechanic choices to maximize psychological fidelity. In-virtual reality performance data for time-to-critical actions and stress physiology markers (heart rate, salivary cortisol) were collected from expert pediatric emergency physicians and novice pediatric residents. Data were analyzed to examine differences between the 2 groups for both outcome types to determine the extent of stress response or performance deficit the VR induced.RESULTS: Multiple difficulties and distractions were designed for the 2 scenarios; we evaluated the highest difficulty and environmental distraction versions. Between 19 expert physicians and 15 novice physicians, no performance differences were found in typical airway, breathing, and circulation actions. Residents preferred more lorazepam first-line antiepileptics than attendings (P = 0.003) and performed a cricothyrotomy later than attendings (P = 0.02). Residents, however, manifested higher salivary cortisol levels than attendings (+0.07 mug/dL, 95% confidence interval = 0.03-0.12, P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: A VR resuscitation simulation manifested expected stress physiology changes in physicians. Further evaluation is needed to determine the effect of VR simulation as longitudinal stress inoculation for healthcare providers.",2021,,Simulation in Healthcare: The Journal of The Society for Medical Simulation,16,6,e219-e226,33273419,,,#6352,Chang 2021,,
Using a 360degree Virtual Reality or 2D Video to Learn History Taking and Physical Examination Skills for Undergraduate Medical Students: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Chao, Y. P.; Chuang, H. H.; Hsin, L. J.; Kang, C. J.; Fang, T. J.; Li, H. Y.; Huang, C. G.; Kuo, T. B. J.; Yang, C. C. H.; Shyu, H. Y.; Wang, S. L.; Shyu, L. Y.; Lee, L. A.","BACKGROUND: Learning through a 360degree virtual reality (VR) or 2D video represents an alternative way to learn a complex medical education task. However, there is currently no consensus on how best to assess the effects of different learning materials on cognitive load estimates, heart rate variability (HRV), outcomes, and experience in learning history taking and physical examination (H&P) skills.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate how learning materials (ie, VR or 2D video) impact learning outcomes and experience through changes in cognitive load estimates and HRV for learning H&P skills.METHODS: This pilot system-design study included 32 undergraduate medical students at an academic teaching hospital. The students were randomly assigned, with a 1:1 allocation, to a 360degree VR video group or a 2D video group, matched by age, sex, and cognitive style. The contents of both videos were different with regard to visual angle and self-determination. Learning outcomes were evaluated using the Milestone reporting form. Subjective and objective cognitive loads were estimated using the Paas Cognitive Load Scale, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index, and secondary-task reaction time. Cardiac autonomic function was assessed using HRV measurements. Learning experience was assessed using the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire and qualitative feedback. Statistical significance was accepted at a two-sided P value of <.01.RESULTS: All 32 participants received the intended intervention. The sample consisted of 20 (63%) males and 12 (38%) females, with a median age of 24 (IQR 23-25) years. The 360degree VR video group seemed to have a higher Milestone level than the 2D video group (P=.04). The reaction time at the 10th minute in the 360degree VR video group was significantly higher than that in the 2D video group (P<.001). Multiple logistic regression models of the overall cohort showed that the 360degree VR video module was independently and positively associated with a reaction time at the 10th minute of >=3.6 seconds (exp B=18.8, 95% CI 3.2-110.8; P=.001) and a Milestone level of >=3 (exp B=15.0, 95% CI 2.3-99.6; P=.005). However, a reaction time at the 10th minute of >=3.6 seconds was not related to a Milestone level of >=3. A low-frequency to high-frequency ratio between the 5th and 10th minute of >=1.43 seemed to be inversely associated with a hedonic stimulation score of >=2.0 (exp B=0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.68; P=.015) after adjusting for video module. The main qualitative feedback indicated that the 360degree VR video module was fun but caused mild dizziness, whereas the 2D video module was easy to follow but tedious.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results showed that 360degree VR video learning may be associated with a better Milestone level than 2D video learning, and that this did not seem to be related to cognitive load estimates or HRV indexes in the novice learners. Of note, an increase in sympathovagal balance may have been associated with a lower hedonic stimulation score, which may have met the learners' needs and prompted learning through the different video modules.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03501641; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03501641.",2021,,JMIR Serious Games,9,4,e13124,34813485,,,#6356,Chao 2021,,
"Evaluation of simulation models in neurosurgical training according to face, content, and construct validity: a systematic review","Chawla, S.; Devi, S.; Calvachi, P.; Gormley, W. B.; Rueda-Esteban, R.","BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical training has been traditionally based on an apprenticeship model. However, restrictions on clinical exposure reduce trainees' operative experience. Simulation models may allow for a more efficient, feasible, and time-effective acquisition of skills. Our objectives were to use face, content, and construct validity to review the use of simulation models in neurosurgical education.METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were queried for eligible studies. After excluding duplicates, 1204 studies were screened. Eighteen studies were included in the final review.RESULTS: Neurosurgical skills assessed included aneurysm clipping (n = 6), craniotomy and burr hole drilling (n = 2), tumour resection (n = 4), and vessel suturing (n = 3). All studies assessed face validity, 11 assessed content, and 6 assessed construct validity. Animal models (n = 5), synthetic models (n = 7), and VR models (n = 6) were assessed. In face validation, all studies rated visual realism favourably, but haptic realism was key limitation. The synthetic models ranked a high median tactile realism (4 out of 5) compared to other models. Assessment of content validity showed positive findings for anatomical and procedural education, but the models provided more benefit to the novice than the experienced group. The cadaver models were perceived to be the most anatomically realistic by study participants. Construct validity showed a statistically significant proficiency increase among the junior group compared to the senior group across all modalities.CONCLUSION: Our review highlights evidence on the feasibility of implementing simulation models in neurosurgical training. Studies should include predictive validity to assess future skill on an individual on whom the same procedure will be administered. This study shows that future neurosurgical training systems call for surgical simulation and objectively validated models.",2022,,Acta Neurochirurgica,164,4,947-966,35122126,,,#6367,Chawla 2022,,
Achieving Interface and Environment Fidelity in the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer,"Chellali, A.; Mentis, H.; Miller, A.; Ahn, W.; Arikatla, V. S.; Sankaranarayanan, G.; De, S.; Schwaitzberg, S. D.; Cao, C. G. L.","Virtual reality trainers are educational tools with great potential for laparoscopic surgery. They can provide basic skills training in a controlled environment and free of risks for patients. They can also offer objective performance assessment without the need for proctors. However, designing effective user interfaces that allow the acquisition of the appropriate technical skills on these systems remains a challenge. This paper aims to examine a process for achieving interface and environment fidelity during the development of the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaST). Two iterations of the design process were conducted and evaluated. For that purpose, a total of 42 subjects participated in two experimental studies in which two versions of the VBLaST were compared to the accepted standard in the surgical community for training and assessing basic laparoscopic skills in North America, the FLS box-trainer. Participants performed 10 trials of the peg transfer task on each trainer. The assessment of task performance was based on the validated FLS scoring method. Moreover, a subjective evaluation questionnaire was used to assess the fidelity aspects of the VBLaST relative to the FLS trainer. Finally, a focus group session with expert surgeons was conducted as a comparative situated evaluation after the first design iteration. This session aimed to assess the fidelity aspects of the early VBLaST prototype as compared to the FLS trainer. The results indicate that user performance on the earlier version of the VBLaST resulting from the first design iteration was significantly lower than the performance on the standard FLS box-trainer. The comparative situated evaluation with domain experts permitted us to identify some issues related to the visual, haptic and interface fidelity on this early prototype. Results of the second experiment indicate that the performance on the second generation VBLaST was significantly improved as compared to the first generation and not significantly different from that of the standard FLS box-trainer. Furthermore, the subjects rated the fidelity features of the modified VBLaST version higher than the early version. These findings demonstrate the value of the comparative situated evaluation sessions entailing hands on reflection by domain experts to achieve the environment and interface fidelity and training objectives when designing a virtual reality laparoscopic trainer. This suggests that this method could be used successfully in the future to enhance the value of VR systems as an alternative to physical trainers for laparoscopic surgery skills. Some recommendations on how to use this method to achieve the environment and interface fidelity of a VR laparoscopic surgical trainer are identified.",2016,,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,96,,22-37,30393449,,,#6370,Chellali 2016,,
Virtual reality as a learning tool in spinal anatomy and surgical techniques,"Chen, T.; Zhang, Y.; Ding, C.; Ting, K.; Yoon, S.; Sahak, H.; Hope, A.; McLachlin, S.; Crawford, E.; Hardisty, M.; Larouche, J.; Finkelstein, J.","BACKGROUND: Surgical simulation is a valuable educational tool for trainees to practice in a safe, standardized, and controlled environment. Interactive feedback-based virtual reality (VR) has recently moved to the forefront of spine surgery training, with most commercial products focusing on instrumentation. There is a paucity of learning tools directed at decompression principles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of VR simulation and its educational role in learning spinal anatomy and decompressive techniques.METHODS: A VR simulation module was created with custom-developed software. Orthopaedic and neurosurgical trainees were prospectively enrolled and interacted with patient-specific 3D models of lumbar spinal stenosis while wearing a headset. A surgical toolkit allowed users to perform surgical decompression, specifically removing soft tissues and bone. The module allowed users to perform various techniques in posterior decompressions and comprehend anatomic areas of stenosis. Pre- and post-module testing, and utility questionnaires were administered to provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the module as a learning device.RESULTS: 28 trainees were enrolled (20-orthopaedic, 8-neurosurgery) in the study. Pre-test scores on anatomic knowledge progressively improved and showed strong positive correlation with year-in-training (Pearson's r = 0.79). Following simulation, the average improvement in post-test scores was 11.4% in junior trainees (PGYI-III), and 1.0% in senior trainees (PGYIII-Fellows). Knowledge improvement approached statistical significance amongst junior trainees (p = 0.0542). 89% of participants found the VR module useful in understanding and learning the pathology of spinal stenosis. 71% found it useful in comprehending decompressive techniques. 96% believed it had utility in preoperative planning with patient-specific models.CONCLUSIONS: Our original VR spinal decompression simulation has shown to be overwhelmingly positively received amongst trainees as both a learning module of patho-anatomy and patient-specific preoperative planning, with particular benefit for junior trainees.",2021,,North American Spine Society Journal,6,,100063,35141628,,,#6395,Chen 2021,,
Immersive virtual reality (VR) training increases the self-efficacy of in-hospital healthcare providers and patient families regarding tracheostomy-related knowledge and care skills: A prospective pre-post study,"Chiang, D.

Y.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR)-based simulation in hospital settings facilitates the acquisition of skills without compromising patient safety. Despite regular text-based training, a baseline survey of randomly selected healthcare providers revealed deficiencies in their knowledge, confidence, comfort, and care skills regarding tracheostomy. This prospective pre-post study compared the effectiveness of regular text- and VR-based intervention modules in training healthcare providers' self-efficacy in tracheostomy care skills.METHODS: Between January 2018 and January 2020, 60 healthcare providers, including physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, were enrolled. For the intervention, a newly developed head-mounted display (HMD) and web VR materials were implemented in training and clinical services. Subsequently, in-hospital healthcare providers were trained using either text or head-mounted display virtual reality (HMD-VR) materials in the regular and intervention modules, respectively. For tracheostomy care skills, preceptors directly audited the performance of trainees and provided feedback.RESULTS: At baseline, the degree of trainees' agreement with the self-efficacy-related statements, including the aspects of familiarity, confidence, and anxiety about tracheostomy-related knowledge and care skills, were not different between the control and intervention groups. At follow-up stage, compared with the regular group, a higher percentage of intervention group' trainees reported that they are ""strongly agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" that the HMD-VR simulation increases their self-efficacy, including the aspects of familiarity and confidence, and reduced their anxiety about tracheostomy-related knowledge and care skills. After implementation, a higher degree of trainees' average satisfaction with VR-based training and VR materials was observed in the intervention group than in the regular group. Most reported that VR materials enabled accurate messaging and decreased anxiety. The increasing trend of the average written test and hands-on tracheostomy care skills scores among the intervention group trainees was significant compared to those in the regular group. The benefits of HMD-VR simulations and web-VR material-based clinical services for in-hospital healthcare providers and patient families persisted until 3 to 4 weeks later.CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that VR materials significantly enhance trainees' self-efficacy (increased familiarity, increased confidence, and reduced anxiety) and their satisfaction with the training, while motivating them to use acquired knowledge and skills in clinical practice.",2022,,Medicine,101,2,e28570,35029229,,,#6418,Chiang 2022,,

The Role of Active Engagement of Peer Observation in the Acquisition of Surgical Skills in Virtual Reality Tasks for Novices,"Chiu, H. Y.; Kang, Y. N.; Wang, W. L.; Chen, C. C.; Hsu, W.; Tseng, M. F.; Wei, P. L.","OBJECTIVE: Peer-assisted learning has been regarded as an adjunct to teaching modalities. It remains inconclusive regarding the benefits of peer observation in skills learning. Hence, we investigated whether the active engagement (AE) of peer observation in addition to expert demonstration would facilitate the performance in the virtual reality (VR) tasks.SETTING/DESIGN: The programs involved 4 VR tasks including basic (camera targeting), intermediate (energy dissection and energy switching), and advanced (suture sponge) tasks in the da Vinci Skills Simulators, which were set up in the operating room at Taipei Medical University Hospital. Fifty medical students participated in the study. The AE of the participants was defined as the total number of peer observations in addition to expert observation before their performance. We assessed the correlations between AE and surgical task performance using Pearson correlation and the concept of learning analytics.PARTICIPANTS: Medical students (sixth-year students in Taiwan, equivalent to fourth-year students in the US system) from Taipei Medical University were recruited.RESULTS: AE was correlated with the energy dissection task (r=0.329, p=0.02) and marginally associated with the energy switching task (r=0.271, p=0.057). However, AE was not correlated with either task scores for camera targeting (r=0.096, p=0.509) or task scores for suture sponge (r=-0.091, p=0.529).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that AE of peer observation may facilitate learning energy dissection task, which is an intermediate-level task, but not in other basic or advanced tasks in a VR context. The study highlights the potential effect of AE of peer observation on surgical learning based on a distinct level of tasks. Tasks that fit the learners' level are recommended. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of peer observation on surgical training still has to be explored to ensure favorable results and optimal learning outcomes.",2019,,Journal of Surgical Education,76,6,1655-1662,31130508,,,#6431,Chiu 2019,,

Declarative knowledge (measured with 20 multiple choice questions) and procedural knowledge (measured with written questions derived from an Objective Structured Clinical Examination station) were assessed before and after working with EMERGE. Students' impression of the effectiveness and applicability of EMERGE were measured on a 6-point Likert scale.RESULTS: A pretest-posttest comparison yielded a significant increase in declarative knowledge. The percentage of correct answers to multiple choice questions increased from before (mean 60.4, SD 16.6) to after (mean 76.0, SD 11.6) playing EMERGE (P<.001).

The Role of Mixed Reality Simulation for Surgical Training in Spine: Phase 1 Validation,"Coelho, G.; Defino, H. L.

Training a new surgeon may take years of hands-on procedures, increasing the risk to patient's safety. The development of surgical simulation platforms is therefore essential to reducing the risk of potentially serious risks and improving outcome.METHODS: Sixteen experienced spinal surgeons evaluated these simulators and answered the questionnaire regarding the simulation as a beneficial education tool. They evaluated the simulators in regard to dissection by planes, identification of pathology (lumbar canal stenosis), instrumentation and simulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and the relevant aspects of the computerized tomography (CT) imaging.RESULTS: The virtual and physical simulators for spine surgery were approved by an expert surgery team, and considered adequate for educational purposes. The proportion of the answers was estimated by the confidence intervals.CONCLUSION: The surgery team considered that this virtual simulation provides a highly effective training environment, and it significantly enhances teaching of surgical anatomy and operative strategies in the neurosurgical field. A mixture of physical and virtual simulation provided the desired results of enhancing the requisite psychomotor and cognitive skills, previously acquired only during a surgical apprenticeship. The combination of these tools may potentially improve and abbreviate the learning curve for trainees, in a safe environment.Level of evidence: 3.",2018,,Spine,43,22,1609-1616,30180147,,,#6472,Coelho 2018,,
Development and evaluation of a new pediatric mixed-reality model for neurosurgical training,"Coelho, G.; Figueiredo, E. G.; Rabelo, N. N.; Teixeira, M.

However, mastering these neurosurgical procedures requires many years of supervised training. The use of surgical simulation can reduce the risk of intraoperative error. The authors propose a new instrument for neurosurgical education, which mixes reality with virtual and realistic simulation for repair of craniosynostosis (scaphocephaly type).METHODS: This study tested reality simulators with a synthetic thermo-retractile/thermosensitive rubber joined with different polymers. To validate the model, 18 experienced surgeons participated in this study using 3D videos developed using 3DS Max software. Renier's ""H"" technique for craniosynostosis correction was applied during the simulation. All participants completed questionnaires to evaluate the simulator.RESULTS: An expert surgical team approved the craniosynostosis reality and virtual simulators. More than 94% of participants found the simulator relevant, considering aspects such as weight, surgical positioning, dissection by planes, and cranial reconstruction. The consistency and material resistance were also approved on average by more than 60% of the surgeons.CONCLUSIONS: The virtual simulator demands a high degree of effectiveness with 3D perception in anatomy and operative strategies in neurosurgical training.

Use of a head-mounted patient display in a task driven anaesthesia simulator: a randomised trial,"Cole, J. H.; Hughey, S.","INTRODUCTION: Head-mounted displays (HMDs) are becoming increasingly investigated in the realm of healthcare. These devices are worn on the user's head and display information directly to the eye. This allows for near-constant delivery of information, regardless of user position. Increasing advances in technology have allowed for miniaturisation, increasing sophistication, wireless capability and prolonged battery life, all of which allow for more opportunities for these devices to be used in a clinical setting.METHODS: A prospective, randomised, controlled, parallel-group study was conducted. Subjects were randomised to either an HMD group or a non-HMD group. All subjects then underwent a standardised intraoperative care simulation experience consisting of multiple procedures that required completion within a set time limit. During this period, subjects concurrently monitored the physiological state of a simulated patient. Multiple standardised physiological derangements were displayed to the subjects via either the worn HMD or standard monitors. The primary outcome was the time to recognition of these physiological derangements.RESULTS: A total of 39 anaesthesia providers were enrolled in this study. There was a significant decrease in the total time it took them to recognise the simulated physiological derangements in the HMD group (difference of 38.2% (95% CI 20.3% to 56.1%); p=0.011) No significant differences in the time that it took to perform the required simulated procedures were observed. Significantly fewer physiological derangements were overlooked by the HMD group than the control group overall (relative risk reduction 0.78 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.94); p=0.003).CONCLUSIONS: Recent advances in HMD technology may be able to produce a functional adjunctive monitoring device that improves the speed with which anaesthesia providers respond to intraoperative events. This benefit comes without increasing distraction from the task. Further studies in true operative environments are needed to validate this technology.",2022,,BMJ Military Health,22,,22,35868713,,,#6486,Cole 2022,,

T.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Simulation refers to educational tools that allow for repetitive instruction in a nonpatient care environment that is risk-free. In GI endoscopy, simulators include ex vivo animal tissue models, live animal models, mechanical models, and virtual reality (VR) computer simulators.METHODS: After a structured search of the peer-reviewed medical literature, this document reviews commercially available GI endoscopy simulation systems and clinical outcomes of simulation in endoscopy.RESULTS: Mechanical simulators and VR simulators are frequently used early in training, whereas ex vivo and in vivo animal models are more commonly used for advanced endoscopy training. Multiple studies and systematic reviews show that simulation-based training appears to provide novice endoscopists with some advantage over untrained peers with regard to endpoints such as independent procedure completion and performance time, among others. Data also suggest that simulation training may accelerate the acquisition of specific technical skills in colonoscopy and upper endoscopy early in training. However, the available literature suggests that the benefits of simulator training appear to attenuate and cease after a finite period. Further studies are needed to determine if meeting competency metrics using simulation will predict actual clinical competency.CONCLUSIONS: Simulation training is a promising modality that may aid in endoscopic education. However, for widespread incorporation of simulators into gastroenterology training programs to occur, simulators must show a sustained advantage over traditional mentored teaching in a cost-effective manner. Because most studies evaluating simulation have focused on novice learners, the role of simulation training in helping practicing endoscopists gain proficiency using new techniques and devices should be further explored.",2019,,Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,90,1,12-Jan,31122746,,,#6496,AsgeTechnologyCommittee 2019,,

Traditional teaching has relied on the use of cadavers; however, this method is resource-intensive and does not allow for repeated practice. Virtual reality surgical training is a growing field that is increasingly being adopted in Otolaryngology. CardinalSim is a virtual reality temporal bone surgical simulator that offers a high-quality, inexpensive adjunct to traditional teaching methods. The objective of this study was to establish the face and content validity of CardinalSim through a national study.METHODS: Otolaryngologists and resident trainees from across Canada were recruited to evaluate CardinalSim. Ethics approval and informed consent was obtained. A face and content validity questionnaire with questions categorized into 13 domains was distributed to participants following simulator use. Descriptive statistics were used to describe questionnaire results, and either Chi-square or Fishers exact tests were used to compare responses between junior residents, senior residents, and practising surgeons.RESULTS: Sixty-two participants from thirteen different Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery programs were included in the study (32 practicing surgeons; 30 resident trainees). Face validity was achieved for 5 out of 7 domains, while content validity was achieved for 5 out of 6 domains. Significant differences between groups (p-value of < 0.05) were found for one face validity domain (realistic ergonomics, p = 0.002) and two content validity domains (teaching drilling technique, p = 0.011 and overall teaching utility, p = 0.006). The assessment scores, global rating scores, and overall attitudes towards CardinalSim, were universally positive. Open-ended questions identified limitations of the simulator.CONCLUSION: CardinalSim met acceptable criteria for face and content validity.

Supporting self-regulation in simulation-based education: a randomized experiment of practice schedules and goals,"Cook, D. A.; Aljamal, Y.; Pankratz, V. S.; Sedlack, R. E.; Farley, D. R.; Brydges, R.","Self-regulated learning is optimized when instructional supports are provided. We evaluated three supports for self-regulated simulation-based training: practice schedules, normative comparisons, and learning goals. Participants practiced 5 endoscopy tasks on a physical simulator, then completed 4 repetitions on a virtual reality simulator. Study A compared two practice schedules: sequential (master each task in assigned order) versus unstructured (trainee-defined). Study B compared normative comparisons framed as success (10% of trainees were successful) versus failure (90% of trainees were unsuccessful). Study C compared a time-only goal (go 1 min faster) versus time + quality goal (go 1 min faster with better visualization and scope manipulation). Participants (18 surgery interns, 17 research fellows, 5 medical/college students) were randomly assigned to groups. In Study A, the sequential group had higher task completion (10/19 vs. 1/21; P < .001), longer persistence attempting an ultimately incomplete task (20.0 vs. 15.9 min; P = .03), and higher efficiency (43% vs. 27%; P = .02), but task time was similar between groups (20.0 vs. 22.6 min; P = .23). In Study B, the success orientation group had higher task completion (10/16 vs. 1/24; P < .001) and longer persistence (21.2 vs. 14.6 min; P = .001), but efficiency was similar (33% vs. 35%; P = .84). In Study C, the time-only group had greater efficiency than time + quality (56% vs. 41%; P = .03), but task time did not differ significantly (172 vs. 208 s; P = .07). In this complex motor task, a sequential (vs. unstructured) schedule, success (vs. failure) orientation, and time-only (vs. time + quality) goal improved some (but not all) performance outcomes.",2019,,Advances in Health Sciences Education,24,2,199-213,30382496,,,#6506,Cook 2019,,
Perceptions of clinical utility of an Augmented Reality musical software among health care professionals,"Correa, A. G. D.; de Assis, G. A.; do Nascimento, M.; de Deus Lopes, R.","PURPOSE: Augmented Reality musical software (GenVirtual) is a technology, which primarily allows users to develop music activities for rehabilitation. This study aimed to analyse the perceptions of health care professionals regarding the clinical utility of GenVirtual. A second objective was to identify improvements to GenVirtual software and similar technologies.METHOD: Music therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapist who assist people with physical and cognitive disabilities were enrolled in three focus groups. The quantitative and qualitative data were collected through inductive thematic analysis.RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: the use of GenVirtual in health care areas; opportunities for realistic application of GenVirtual; and limitations in the use of GenVirtual. The registration units identified were: motor stimulation, cognitive stimulation, verbal learning, recreation activity, musicality, accessibility, motivation, sonic accuracy, interference of lighting, poor sound, children and adults.CONCLUSION: This research suggested that the GenVirtual is a complementary tool to conventional clinical practice and has great potential to motor and cognitive rehabilitation of children and adults. Implications for Rehabilitation Gaining health professional' perceptions of the Augmented Reality musical game (GenVirtual) give valuable information as to the clinical utility of the software. GenVirtual was perceived as a tool that could be used as enhancing the motor and cognitive rehabilitation process. GenVirtual was viewed as a tool that could enhance clinical practice and communication among various agencies, but it was suggested that it should be used with caution to avoid confusion and replacement of important services.",2017,,Disability & Rehabilitation Assistive Technology,12,3,205-216,26406993,,,#6515,Correa 2017,,
Virtual Reality simulator for dental anesthesia training in the inferior alveolar nerve block,"Correa, C. G.; Machado, Maam; Ranzini, E.; Tori, R.; Nunes, F. L. S.","OBJECTIVES: This study shows the development and validation of a dental anesthesia-training simulator, specifically for the inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB). The system developed provides the tactile sensation of inserting a real needle in a human patient, using Virtual Reality (VR) techniques and a haptic device that can provide a perceived force feedback in the needle insertion task during the anesthesia procedure.MATERIAL AND METHODS: To simulate a realistic anesthesia procedure, a Carpule syringe was coupled to a haptic device. The Volere method was used to elicit requirements from users in the Dentistry area; Repeated Measures Two-Way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), Tukey post-hoc test and averages for the results' analysis. A questionnaire-based subjective evaluation method was applied to collect information about the simulator, and 26 people participated in the experiments (12 beginners, 12 at intermediate level, and 2 experts). The questionnaire included profile, preferences (number of viewpoints, texture of the objects, and haptic device handler), as well as visual (appearance, scale, and position of objects) and haptic aspects (motion space, tactile sensation, and motion reproduction).RESULTS: The visual aspect was considered appropriate and the haptic feedback must be improved, which the users can do by calibrating the virtual tissues' resistance. The evaluation of visual aspects was influenced by the participants' experience, according to ANOVA test (F=15.6, p=0.0002, with p<0.01). The user preferences were the simulator with two viewpoints, objects with texture based on images and the device with a syringe coupled to it.CONCLUSION: The simulation was considered thoroughly satisfactory for the anesthesia training, considering the needle insertion task, which includes the correct insertion point and depth, as well as the perception of tissues resistances during the insertion.",2017,,Journal of Applied Oral Science,25,4,357-366,28877273,,,#6516,Correa 2017,,
Immersive Virtual Reality Medical Simulation: Autonomous Trauma Training Simulator,"Couperus, K.; Young, S.; Walsh, R.; Kang, C.; Skinner, C.; Essendrop, R.; Fiala, K.; Phelps, J. F.; Sletten, Z.; Esposito, M. T.; Bothwell, J.; Gorbatkin, C.","Background Medical and traumatic emergencies can be intimidating and stressful. This is especially true for early-career medical personnel.Training providers to respond effectively to medical emergencies before being confronted with a real scenario is limited by unnatural or high-cost training modalities that fail to realistically replicate the stress and gravity of real-world trauma management. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) may provide a unique training solution. Methods We created a working group of 10 active duty or former military emergency medicine physicians and two technical experts. We hosted 10 meetings to facilitate the development process. The program was developed with financial support from the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), through the primary vendor Exonicus, Inc, with support from Anatomy Next Inc, and Kitware, Inc. Development was completed using an agile project management style, which allowed our team to review progress and provide immediate feedback on previous milestones throughout its completion. The working group completed the resulting four simulation scenarios to evaluate perceived realism and training potential. Finally, testing of the technology platform off the network in a deployed role 3 was conducted. Results Upon completion, we created four IVR scenarios based on the highest mortality battlefield injuries: hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax, and airway obstruction. The working group unanimously indicated a high level of realism and potential training usefulness. Throughout this process, there have been a number of lessons learned and we present those here to show what we have created as well as provide guidance to others creating IVR training solutions. Conclusion Our team developed trauma scenarios that, to our knowledge, are the only IVR trauma scenarios to run autonomously without instructor input. Furthermore, we provide a potential template for the creation of future autonomous IVR training programs. This framework may offer a dynamic starting point as more teams seek to leverage the capabilities IVR offers.",2020,,Cureus,12,5,e8062,32542120,,,#6526,Couperus 2020,,
Virtual Reality vs Dry Laboratory Models: Comparing Automated Performance Metrics and Cognitive Workload During Robotic Simulation Training,"Cowan, A.; Chen, J.; Mingo, S.; Reddy, S. S.; Ma, R.; Marshall, S.; Nguyen, J. H.; Hung, A. J.","<b>Background:</b> This study compares surgical performance during analogous vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA) tasks in two robotic training environments, virtual reality (VR) and dry laboratory (DL), to investigate transferability of skill assessment across the two platforms. Utilizing computer-generated performance metrics and pupillary data, we evaluated the two environments to distinguish surgical expertise and ultimately whether performance in the VR simulation correlates with performance in live robotic surgery in the DL. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Experts (>=300 cases) and trainees (<300 cases) performed analogous VUAs during VR and DL sessions on a da Vinci robotic console following an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol (HS-16-00318). Twenty-two metrics were generated in each environment (kinematic metrics, tissue metrics, and biometrics). The DL included 18 previously validated automated performance metrics (APMs) (kinematics and event metrics) captured by an Intuitive system data recorder. In both settings, Tobii Pro Glasses 2 recorded the task-evoked pupillary response (reported as Index of Cognitive Activity [ICA]) to indicate cognitive workload, analyzed by EyeTracking cognitive workload software. Pearson correlation, Mann-Whitney, and independent t-tests were used for the comparative analyses. <b>Results:</b> Our study included six experts (median caseload 1300 [interquartile range 400-3000]) and 11 trainees (25 [0-250]). A total of 8/9 metrics directly comparable between VR and DL showed significant positive correlation (r >= 0.554, p <= 0.032); 5/22 VR metrics distinguished expertise, including task time (p = 0.031), clutch usage (p = 0.040), unnecessary needle piercing (p = 0.026), and suspected injury to the endopelvic fascia (p = 0.040). This contrasts with 14/22 APMs in DL (p <= 0.038), including linear velocities of all three instruments (p <= 0.038) and dominant-hand instrument wrist articulation (p = 0.013). Trainees experienced higher cognitive workload (ICA) in both environments when compared with experts (p < 0.036). <b>Conclusions:</b> Most performance metrics between VR and DL exhibited moderate to strong correlations, showing transferability of skills across the platforms. Comparing training environments, APMs during DL tasks are better able to distinguish expertise than VR-generated metrics.",2021,,Journal of Endourology,35,10,1571-1576,34235970,,,#6529,Cowan 2021,,
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training by Avatars: A Qualitative Study of Medical Students' Experiences Using a Multiplayer Virtual World,"Creutzfeldt, J.; Hedman, L.; Fellander-Tsai, L.","BACKGROUND: Emergency medical practices are often team efforts. Training for various tasks and collaborations may be carried out in virtual environments. Although promising results exist from studies of serious games, little is known about the subjective reactions of learners when using multiplayer virtual world (MVW) training in medicine.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to reach a better understanding of the learners' reactions and experiences when using an MVW for team training of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).METHODS: Twelve Swedish medical students participated in semistructured focus group discussions after CPR training in an MVW with partially preset options. The students' perceptions and feelings related to use of this educational tool were investigated. Using qualitative methodology, discussions were analyzed by a phenomenological data-driven approach. Quality measures included negotiations, back-and-forth reading, triangulation, and validation with the informants.RESULTS: Four categories characterizing the students' experiences could be defined: (1) Focused Mental Training, (2) Interface Diverting Focus From Training, (3) Benefits of Practicing in a Group, and (4) Easy Loss of Focus When Passive. We interpreted the results, compared them to findings of others, and propose advantages and risks of using virtual worlds for learning.CONCLUSIONS: Beneficial aspects of learning CPR in a virtual world were confirmed. To achieve high participant engagement and create good conditions for training, well-established procedures should be practiced. Furthermore, students should be kept in an active mode and frequent feedback should be utilized. It cannot be completely ruled out that the use of virtual training may contribute to erroneous self-beliefs that can affect later clinical performance.",2016,,JMIR Serious Games,4,2,e22,27986645,,,#6537,Creutzfeldt 2016,,
The impact of tiredness on virtual reality robotic surgical skills,"Cumpanas, A. A.; Bardan, R.; Ferician, O.; Latcu, S. C.; Lazar, O. F.; Duta, C.","INTRODUCTION: The effect of tiredness has been proved for the surgeons' musculature performing laparoscopic or robotic procedures (physical stress). Mental stress after robotic surgery has been reported as well. It is still unclear how much the surgical skills are altered and which types of skills are more affected at the final steps of long, complex robotic surgical procedures.AIM: To evaluate to what extent the surgeon's skills are influenced by long procedures, using the objective assessment of different surgical skills by a virtual reality robotic simulator.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen surgeons were asked to perform a continuous 4 h virtual robotic surgical simulator training session. At the beginning of simulator training and at the end of each of the 4 h of training, three exercises of increasing difficulty were selected to be performed in order to assess the surgeons' skills.RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between the initial and final overall scores for all the three exercises, the final outcomes being inferior. The specific metrics for each exercise slightly improved within 1 h from the beginning and thereafter decreased to a statistically significantly inferior value.CONCLUSIONS: The specific metrics on the virtual reality robotic surgical simulator were altered after a 4-hour console training period.

Does sleep deprivation alter virtual reality-based robotic surgical skills?,"Cumpanas, A. A.; Ferician, O.; Latcu, S.; Duta, C.; Bardan, R.; Lazar, F. O.","INTRODUCTION: Robotic surgery is widely used in many surgical specialities, and there has been no study to assess the impact of sleep deprivation on the complex environment of robotic surgery.AIM: To compare specific metrics of selected robotic simulator exercises on sleep-deprived and non-sleep-deprived surgical residents.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We enrolled 20 volunteers, residents in surgery, evaluated before and after an 18-hour overnight shift, regarding their results on virtual robotic surgery simulator - the sleep deprivation (SD) group. As a control group, the same subjects were evaluated 5-7 days after the post-shift evaluation, without having a shift overnight and at least 7 h of sleep the previous night - the non-sleep-deprivation (nSD) group.RESULTS: A statistically significant difference between the pre-shift and post-shift overall results for all exercises in the SD group and no statistical differences for the nSD group were observed. As the difficulty of the exercises increased, statistical differences were observed on specific metrics for all exercises between the pre-shift and post-shift as well as between the post-shift and the morning after a normal sleep period overnight. In a subgroup analysis, the overall results revealed a stronger statistical difference between pre-shift and post-shift for residents with more intense sleep deprivation (< 3 h of sleep vs. > 3 h of sleep).CONCLUSIONS: Sleep deprivation leads to impairment of surgical skills assessed by robotic virtual simulator. The more complex and skill demanding the exercise, the higher the difference between sleep deprived and non-deprived residents.",2020,,Wideochirurgia I Inne Techniki Maloinwazyjne,15,1,97-105,32117491,,,#6546,Cumpanas 2020,,
Fundamentals of Arthroscopic Surgery Training Program Improves Knee Arthroscopy Simulator Performance in Arthroscopic Trainees,"Cychosz, C. C.; Tofte, J. N.; Johnson, A.; Gao, Y.; Phisitkul, P.","PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of a nonanatomic simulator in developing basic arthroscopy motor skills transferable to an anatomic model.METHODS: Forty-three arthroscopy novice individuals currently enrolled in medical school were recruited to perform a diagnostic knee arthroscopy using a high-fidelity virtual reality arthroscopic simulator providing haptic feedback after viewing a video of an expert performing an identical procedure. Students were then randomized into an experimental or control group. The experimental group then completed a series of self-guided training modules using the fundamentals of arthroscopy simulator training nonanatomic modules including camera centering, tracking, periscoping, palpation, and collecting stars in a three-dimensional space. Both groups completed another diagnostic knee arthroscopy between 1 and 2 weeks later. Camera path length, time, tibia and femur cartilage damage, as well as a composite score were recorded by the simulator on each attempt.RESULTS: The experimental group (n = 22) showed superior performance in composite score (30.09 vs 24, P = .046) and camera path length (71.51 cm vs 109.07 cm, P = .0274) at the time of the second diagnostic knee arthroscope compared with the control group (n = 21). The experimental group also showed significantly greater improvement in composite score between the first and second arthroscopes compared with the control group (14.27 vs 4.95, P < .01). Femoral and tibial cartilage damage were not significantly improved between arthroscopy attempts (-0.86% vs -1.45%, P = .40) and (-1.10 vs -1.27%, P = .83), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The virtual reality-based fundamentals of arthroscopy simulator training nonanatomic simulator is beneficial in developing basic motor skills in arthroscopy novice individuals resulting in significantly greater composite performance in an anatomic knee model.

Virtual reality simulation of neuroendovascular intervention improves procedure speed in a cohort of trainees,"Dardick, J.; Allen, S.; Scoco, A.; Zampolin, R. L.; Altschul, D. J.","BACKGROUND: Realistic virtual reality (VR) simulators have greatly expanded the tools available for training surgeons and interventionalists. While this technology is effective in improving performance in many fields, it has never been evaluated for neuroendovascular procedures. This study aims to determine whether VR is an effective tool for improving neuroendovascular skill among trainees.METHODS: Trainees performed two VR revascularizations of a right-sided middle cerebral artery (MCA) thrombosis and their times to procedural benchmarks (time to enter internal carotid artery [ICA], traverse clot, and complete procedure) were compared. To determine whether the improvement was case specific, trainees with less procedural exposure were timed during VR left-sided ICA (LICA) aneurysm coiling before or after performing MCA thrombectomy simulations. To determine the value of observing simulations, medical students were timed during the right MCA revascularization simulations after watching other VR procedures.RESULTS: Trainees significantly improved their time to every procedural benchmark during their second MCA revascularization (mean decrease = 1.08, 1.57, and 2.24 min; P = 0.0072, 0.0466, and 0.0230). In addition, time required to access the LICA during aneurysm coiling was shortened by 0.77 min for each previous VR right MCA revascularization performed (P = 0.0176; r <sup>2</sup> = 0.71). Finally, medical students' MCA revascularization simulation times improved by 0.87 min for each prior simulation viewed (P < 0.0221; r <sup>2</sup> = 0.96).CONCLUSION: Both performance and viewing of simulated procedures produced significant decreases in time to reach neuroendovascular procedural benchmarks.

Students practiced a manual dexterity exercise in a virtual reality environment at a standard level of FFB and then were tested at the standard and an altered level of FFB. In addition, the students' satisfaction with the training exercise was evaluated.METHODS: One hundred twenty-six first-year dental students were randomly distributed into four groups and underwent a manual dexterity test in the virtual reality environment with automatic assessment after a 3-month period of practicing with standard FFB. The test consisted of drilling with the standard FFB and an altered level of FFB to evaluate the effect on performance. After the test, the participants completed a questionnaire.RESULTS: The results showed that 74% of the students who passed completed between one of three and three of three successful attempts at FFB levels at which they had not previously practiced.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study imply that if students practice a sufficient amount of time at one level of FFB, a skill is transferable from one level of FFB to another.",2019,,Simulation in Healthcare: The Journal of The Society for Medical Simulation,14,3,169-174,31116175,,,#6597,deBoer 2019,,

The present study aims to explore whether the use of checklists during E-learning improves transfer of skills to the simulated OR on a Virtual Reality (VR) trainer for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).METHODS: Laparoscopy naive medical students (n = 80) were randomized in two groups. After an E-learning introduction to RYGB, checklist group rated RYGB videos using the validated Bariatric Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (BOSATS) checklist while group without checklist only observed the videos. Participants then performed RYGB on a VR-trainer twice and were evaluated by a blinded expert rater using BOSATS. A multiple choice (MC) knowledge test on RYGB was performed. Suturing on a cadaveric porcine small bowel was evaluated using objective structured assessment of technical skill (OSATS).RESULTS: Checklist group was better in the knowledge test (A 8.3 +/- 1.1 vs. B 7.1 +/- 1.3; p <= 0.001) and there was a trend towards better VR RYGB performance (BOSATS) on the first try (85.9 +/- 10.2 vs. 81.1 +/- 11.5; p = 0.058), but not on the second try (92.0 +/- 9.7 vs. 89.3 +/- 10.5; p = 0.251). Suturing as measured by OSATS was not different (29.5 +/- 3.0 vs. 29.0 +/- 3.5; p = 0.472).CONCLUSION: This study presents evidence that the use of a BOSATS checklist during E-learning helps trainees to improve their knowledge acquisition with E-learning.

Pre-graduation medical training including virtual reality during COVID-19 pandemic: a report on students' perception,"De Ponti, R.; Marazzato, J.; Maresca, A. M.; Rovera, F.; Carcano, G.; Ferrario, M. M.","BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic brought significant disruption to in-hospital medical training. Virtual reality simulating the clinical environment has the potential to overcome this issue and can be particularly useful to supplement the traditional in-hospital medical training during the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospital access is banned for medical students. The aim of this study was to assess medical students' perception on fully online training including simulated clinical scenarios during COVID-19 pandemic.METHODS: From May to July 2020 when in-hospital training was not possible, 122 students attending the sixth year of the course of Medicine and Surgery underwent online training sessions including an online platform with simulated clinical scenarios (Body Interact TM) of 21 patient-based cases. Each session focused on one case, lasted 2 h and was divided into three different parts: introduction, virtual patient-based training, and debriefing. In the same period, adjunctive online training with formal presentation and discussion of clinical cases was also given. At the completion of training, a survey was performed, and students filled in a 12-item anonymous questionnaire on a voluntary basis to rate the training quality. Results were reported as percentages or with numeric ratings from 1 to 4. Due to the study design, no sample size was calculated.RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen students (94%) completed the questionnaire: 104 (90%) gave positive evaluation to virtual reality training and 107 (93%) appreciated the format in which online training was structured. The majority of participants considered the platform of virtual reality training realistic for the initial clinical assessment (77%), diagnostic activity (94%), and treatment options (81%). Furthermore, 97 (84%) considered the future use of this virtual reality training useful in addition to the apprenticeship at patient's bedside. Finally, 32 (28%) participants found the online access difficult due to technical issues.CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, online medical training including simulated clinical scenarios avoided training interruption and the majority of participant students gave a positive response on the perceived quality of this training modality.

DVS can provide the students with three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic images and precise structures in anatomy teaching. We investigated the effects of digital virtual simulation (DVS) application in gross anatomy teaching.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourth-year medical students (n=120), majoring clinical medicine in Class 2013 from Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, were assigned into four classes. Two classes received a traditional teaching method and were the control classes, the others received a new teaching reform method-gross anatomy teaching by DVS, and were the experimental classes. After the reform was carried out, the students in teaching reform classes were proceeded to do a subjective evaluation of the teaching method in order to collect feedback information.RESULTS: Students in the experimental group achieved a mean score of 84.97 (+/-7.86) compared to 78.96 (+/-5.78) in the control group, with statistical significance between two the groups (p<0.01). The result of the questionnaire survey showed that the students highly approved this reform in many domains.CONCLUSION: The application of digital virtual simulation could be used to supplement the teaching of gross anatomy, including theoretical and experimental teaching such as specimen dissection.",2018,,Annals of Anatomy,218,,276-282,29679721,,,#6654,Deng 2018,,
Clinical Efficacy of Simulated Vitreoretinal Surgery to Prepare Surgeons for the Upcoming Intervention in the Operating Room,"Deuchler, S.; Wagner, C.; Singh, P.; Muller, M.; Al-Dwairi, R.; Benjilali, R.; Schill, M.; Ackermann, H.; Bon, D.; Kohnen, T.; Schoene, B.; Koss, M.; Koch, F.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of the virtual reality training simulator Eyesi to prepare surgeons for performing pars plana vitrectomies and its potential to predict the surgeons' performance.METHODS: In a preparation phase, four participating vitreoretinal surgeons performed repeated simulator training with predefined tasks. If a surgeon was assigned to perform a vitrectomy for the management of complex retinal detachment after a surgical break of at least 60 hours it was randomly decided whether a warmup training on the simulator was required (n = 9) or not (n = 12). Performance at the simulator was measured using the built-in scoring metrics. The surgical performance was determined by two blinded observers who analyzed the video-recorded interventions. One of them repeated the analysis to check for intra-observer consistency. The surgical performance of the interventions with and without simulator training was compared. In addition, for the surgeries with simulator training, the simulator performance was compared to the performance in the operating room.RESULTS: Comparing each surgeon's performance with and without warmup trainingshowed a significant effect of warmup training onto the final outcome in the operating room. For the surgeries that were preceeded by the warmup procedure, the performance at the simulator was compared with the operating room performance. We found that there is a significant relation. The governing factor of low scores in the simulator were iatrogenic retinal holes, bleedings and lens damage. Surgeons who caused minor damage in the simulation also performed well in the operating room.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the large variation of conditions, the effect of a warmup training as well as a relation between the performance at the simulator and in the operating room was found with statistical significance. Simulator training is able to serve as a warmup to increase the average performance.",2016,,PLoS ONE [Electronic Resource],11,3,e0150690,26964040,,,#6664,Deuchler 2016,,
Augmented Reality-Assisted Video Laryngoscopy and Simulated Neonatal Intubations: A Pilot Study,"Dias, P. L.; Greenberg, R. G.; Goldberg, R. N.; Fisher, K.; Tanaka, D. T.","BACKGROUND: For novice providers, achieving competency in neonatal intubation is becoming increasingly difficult, possibly because of fewer intubation opportunities. In the present study, we compared intubation outcomes on manikins using direct laryngoscopy (DL), indirect video laryngoscopy (IVL) using a modified disposable blade, and augmented reality-assisted video laryngoscopy (ARVL), a novel technique using smart glasses to project a magnified video of the airway into the intubator's visual field.METHODS: Neonatal intensive care nurses (n = 45) with minimal simulated intubation experience were randomly assigned (n = 15) to the following 3 groups: DL, IVL, and ARVL. All participants completed 5 intubation attempts on a manikin using their assigned modalities and received verbal coaching by a supervisor, who viewed the video while assisting the IVL and ARVL groups. The outcome and time of each attempt were recorded.RESULTS: The DL group successfully intubated on 32% of attempts compared to 72% in the IVL group and 71% in the ARVL group (P < .001). The DL group intubated the esophagus on 27% of attempts, whereas there were no esophageal intubations in either the IVL or ARVL groups (P < .001). The median (interquartile range) time to intubate in the DL group was 35.6 (22.9-58.0) seconds, compared to 21.6 (13.9-31.9) seconds in the IVL group and 20.7 (13.2-36.5) seconds in the ARVL group (P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Simulated intubation success of neonatal intensive care nurses was significantly improved by using either IVL or ARVL compared to DL.

Towards Real-time Bone Drilling Simulation for Anchor Placement in VR Based Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Surgery Simulation,"Dinc, F.; Oumimoun, K.; Kwabla, W.; Kockara, S.; Halic, T.; Arikatla, S.; Ahmadi, S.","Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff (ARC) is a minimally invasive surgery of the shoulder. ARC training for surgeons is challenging due to confined space, anatomical complexity, requirement of complex hands-eye coordination skills, subjectivity, and low fidelity in existing training mediums. We therefore offer a virtual reality based photorealistic medical simulation, Virtual Rotator Cuff Arthroscopic Skill Trainer (ViRCAST) for objective training. In this study, as a part of ViRCAST, we introduce a virtual reality-based bone drilling simulation. Bone drilling task is one of the most important tasks that surgeons need to perform before anchor placement in ARC. Realistic simulation of bone drilling with force feedback is complex due to real-time mesh modification and simulation constraints. We introduce a GPU based realtime bone drilling simulation for ViRCAST using an adaptive mesh refinement technique.

"A Structured, Hybrid Cystoscopy Simulation Curriculum for Obstetrics/Gynecology Residents","Do, L.; Pasha, K.; Sanchez, S.; Montoya, T. I.; Maldonado, P. A.","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the subjective and objective cystoscopy skills of gynecology residents before and after implementation of a comprehensive simulation curriculum.METHODS: Residents in an obstetrics/gynecology program at a single academic institution participated in a 6-week cystoscopy simulation course. Residents attended an initial orientation and didactic presentation, and then weekly 20- to 30-minute training sessions using a water balloon model and a virtual reality simulator. Pretesting and posttesting were performed, including (1) subjective self-assessments, (2) a written quiz, and (3) objective structured assessment of technical skills. Paired t test was used to assess the differences in residents' objective assessment scores before and after simulation training.RESULTS: A total of 16 residents were recruited. Residents reported significant subjective improvements in comfort, confidence, and proficiency in performing cystoscopy after completing the curriculum. Their overall objective assessment improved, including written quiz scores (mean score, 49% vs 78%; P < 0.001), efficiency in cystoscope assembly (means score, 0 vs 4; P < 0.001), overall bladder survey score (56% vs 86%, P < 0.001), and global rating score (mean score, 15 vs 24; P < 0.001). Residents tended to prefer the water-balloon model compared with the virtual reality simulator (75% vs 25%).CONCLUSIONS: Obstetrics/gynecology residents demonstrated significant improvements in subjective and objective measures of skill after completion of a 6-week cystoscopy simulation training course using a combination of low- and high-fidelity models. Although universal cystoscopy at the time of hysterectomy for benign indications remains controversial, cystoscopy simulation should remain an important part of resident training.",2021,,Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,27,10,637-641,33438860,,,#6698,Do 2021,,
"Mini Fronto-Orbital Approach: ""Window Opening"" Towards the Superomedial Orbit - A Virtual Reality-Planned Anatomic Study","Donofrio, C. A.; Capitanio, J. F.; Riccio, L.; Herur-Raman, A.; Caputy, A. J.; Mortini, P.","BACKGROUND: Surgical approaches to the orbit are challenging and require combined multispecialist skills. Considering its increasing relevance in neurosurgical practice, keyhole surgery could be also applied to this field. However, mastering a minimally invasive approach necessitates an extended learning curve. For this reason, virtual reality (VR) can be effectively used for planning and training in this demanding surgical technique.OBJECTIVE: To validate the mini fronto-orbital (mFO) approach to the superomedial orbit, using VR planning and specimen dissections, conjugating the principles of skull base and keyhole neurosurgery.METHODS: Three-dimensional measurements were performed thanks to Surgical Theater (Surgical Theater© LLC), and then, simulated craniotomies were implemented on cadaver specimens.RESULTS: The mFO approach affords optimal exposure and operability in the target area and reduced risks of surrounding normal tissue injuries. The eyebrow skin incision, the minimal soft-tissue retraction, the limited temporalis muscle dissection and the single-piece craniotomy, as planned with VR, are the key elements of this minimally invasive approach. Furthermore, the ""window-opening"" cotton-tip intraorbital dissection technique, based on widening surgical corridors between neuromuscular bundles, provides a safe orientation and a deep access inside the orbit, thereby significantly limiting the risk of jeopardizing neurovascular structures.CONCLUSION: The mFO approach associated to the window-opening dissection technique can be considered safe, effective, suitable, and convenient for treating lesions located in the superomedial orbital aspect, up to the orbital apex.",2020,,Operative Neurosurgery,19,3,330-340,31960061,,,#6719,Donofrio 2020,,

A Comparison of Robotic Simulation Performance on Basic Virtual Reality Skills: Simulator Subjective Versus Objective Assessment Tools,"Dubin, A. K.; Smith, R.; Julian, D.; Tanaka, A.; Mattingly, P.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: To answer the question of whether there is a difference between robotic virtual reality simulator performance assessment and validated human reviewers. Current surgical education relies heavily on simulation. Several assessment tools are available to the trainee, including the actual robotic simulator assessment metrics and the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) metrics, both of which have been independently validated. GEARS is a rating scale through which human evaluators can score trainees' performances on 6 domains: depth perception, bimanual dexterity, efficiency, force sensitivity, autonomy, and robotic control. Each domain is scored on a 5-point Likert scale with anchors. We used 2 common robotic simulators, the dV-Trainer (dVT; Mimic Technologies Inc., Seattle, WA) and the da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS; Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA), to compare the performance metrics of robotic surgical simulators with the GEARS for a basic robotic task on each simulator.DESIGN: A prospective single-blinded randomized study.SETTING: A surgical education and training center.PARTICIPANTS: Surgeons and surgeons in training.INTERVENTIONS: Demographic information was collected including sex, age, level of training, specialty, and previous surgical and simulator experience. Subjects performed 2 trials of ring and rail 1 (RR1) on each of the 2 simulators (dVSS and dVT) after undergoing randomization and warm-up exercises. The second RR1 trial simulator performance was recorded, and the deidentified videos were sent to human reviewers using GEARS. Eight different simulator assessment metrics were identified and paired with a similar performance metric in the GEARS tool. The GEARS evaluation scores and simulator assessment scores were paired and a Spearman rho calculated for their level of correlation.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-four subjects were enrolled in this randomized study with 9 subjects excluded for missing or incomplete data. There was a strong correlation between the GEARS score and the simulator metric score for time to complete versus efficiency, time to complete versus total score, economy of motion versus depth perception, and overall score versus total score with rho coefficients greater than or equal to 0.70; these were significant (p < .0001). Those with weak correlation (rho >=0.30) were bimanual dexterity versus economy of motion, efficiency versus master workspace range, bimanual dexterity versus master workspace range, and robotic control versus instrument collisions.CONCLUSION: On basic VR tasks, several simulator metrics are well matched with GEARS scores assigned by human reviewers, but others are not. Identifying these matches/mismatches can improve the training and assessment process when using robotic surgical simulators.",2017,,Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology,24,7,1184-1189,28757439,,,#6738,Dubin 2017,,
A preliminary study of a novel emergency department nursing triage simulation for research applications,"Dubovsky, S. L.; Antonius, D.; Ellis, D. G.; Ceusters, W.; Sugarman, R. C.; Roberts, R.; Kandifer, S.; Phillips, J.; Daurignac, E. C.; Leonard, K. E.; Butler, L. D.; Castner, J. P.; Richard Braen, G.","BACKGROUND: Studying the effect on functioning of the emergency department of disasters with a potential impact on staff members themselves usually involves table top and simulated patient exercises. Computerized virtual reality simulations have the potential to configure a variety of scenarios to determine likely staff responses and how to address them without intensive utilization of resources. To decide whether such studies are justified, we determined whether a novel computer simulation has the potential to serve as a valid and reliable model of on essential function in a busy ED.METHODS: Ten experienced female ED triage nurses (mean age 51) mastered navigating a virtual reality model of triage of 4 patients in an ED with which they were familiar, after which they were presented in a testing session with triage of 6 patients whose cases were developed using the Emergency Severity Index to represent a range of severity and complexity. Attitudes toward the simulation, and perceived workload in the simulation and on the job, were assessed with questionnaires and the NASA task load index. Z-scores were calculated for data points reflecting subject actions, the time to perform them, patient prioritization according to severity, and the importance of the tasks. Data from questionnaires and scales were analyzed with descriptive statistics and paired t tests using SPSS v. 21. Microsoft Excel was used to compute a correlation matrix for all standardized variables and all simulation data.RESULTS: Nurses perceived their work on the simulation task to be equivalent to their workload on the job in all aspects except for physical exertion. Although they were able to work with written communications with the patients, verbal communication would have been preferable. Consistent with the workplace, variability in performance during triage reflected subject skill and experience and was correlated with comfort with the task. Time to perform triage corresponded to the time required in the ED and virtual patients were prioritized appropriately according to severity.CONCLUSIONS: This computerized simulation appears to be a reasonable accurate proxy for ED triage. If future studies of this kind of simulation with a broader range of subjects that includes verbal communication between virtual patients and subjects and interactions of multiple subjects, supports the initial impressions, the virtual ED could be used to study the impact of disaster scenarios on staff functioning.",2017,,BMC research notes,10,1,15,28057048,,,#6739,Dubovsky 2017,,
Effectiveness of the Multilayered Caries Model and Visuo-tactile Virtual Reality Simulator for Minimally Invasive Caries Removal: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Dwisaptarini, A.

A three-dimensional, multilayered caries model was reconstructed from 10 micro-computed tomography (CT) images of deeply carious extracted human teeth before and after caries removal. The full grey scale 0-255 yielded a median grey scale value of 0-9, 10-18, 19-25, 26-52, and 53-80 regarding dental pulp, infected carious dentin, affected carious dentin, normal dentin, and normal enamel, respectively. The simulator was connected to two haptic devices for a handpiece and mouth mirror. The visuo-tactile feedback during the operation varied depending on the grey scale. Sixth-year dental students underwent a pretraining assessment of caries removal on extracted teeth. The students were then randomly assigned to train on either the simulator (n=16) or conventional extracted teeth (n=16) for 3 days, after which the assessment was repeated. The posttraining performance of caries removal improved compared with pretraining in both groups (Wilcoxon, p<0.05). The equivalence test for proportional differences (two 1-sided t-tests) with a 0.2 margin confirmed that the participants in both groups had identical posttraining performance scores (95% CI=0.92, 1; p=0.00). In conclusion, training on the micro-CT multilayered caries model with the visuo-tactile virtual reality simulator and conventional extracted tooth had equivalent effects on improving performance of minimally invasive caries removal.",2018,,Operative dentistry,43,3,E110-E118,29513643,,,#6751,Dwisaptarini 2018,,

Immersive virtual reality enables technical skill acquisition for scrub nurses in complex revision total knee arthroplasty,"Edwards, T. C.; Patel, A.; Szyszka, B.; Coombs, A. W.; Liddle, A. D.; Kucheria, R.; Cobb, J. P.; Logishetty, K.","INTRODUCTION: Immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) is a novel technology which can enhance surgical training in a virtual environment without supervision. However, it is untested for the training to select, assemble and deliver instrumentation in orthopaedic surgery-typically performed by scrub nurses. This study investigates the impact of an iVR curriculum on this facet of the technically demanding revision total knee arthroplasty.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten scrub nurses completed training in four iVR sessions over a 4-week period. Initially, nurses completed a baseline real-world assessment, performing their role with real equipment in a simulated operation assessment. Each subsequent iVR session involved a guided mode, where the software taught participants the procedural choreography and assembly of instrumentation in a simulated operating room. In the latter three sessions, nurses also undertook an assessment in iVR. Outcome measures were related to procedural sequence, duration of surgery and efficiency of movement. Transfer of skills from iVR to the real world was assessed in a post-training simulated operation assessment. A pre- and post-training questionnaire assessed the participants knowledge, confidence and anxiety.RESULTS: Operative time reduced by an average of 47% across the 3 unguided sessions (mean 55.5 +/- 17.6 min to 29.3 +/- 12.1 min, p > 0.001). Assistive prompts reduced by 75% (34.1 +/- 16.8 to 8.6 +/- 8.8, p < 0.001), dominant hand motion by 28% (881.3 +/- 178.5 m to 643.3 +/- 119.8 m, p < 0.001) and head motion by 36% (459.9 +/- 99.7 m to 292.6 +/- 85.3 m, p < 0.001). Real-world skill improved from 11% prior to iVR training to 84% correct post-training. Participants reported increased confidence and reduced anxiety in scrubbing for rTKA procedures (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: For scrub nurses, unfamiliarity with complex surgical procedures or equipment is common.

A serious game skills competition increases voluntary usage and proficiency of a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator during first-year surgical residents' simulation curriculum,"El-Beheiry, M.; McCreery, G.; Schlachta, C. M.","BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a serious game skills competition on voluntary usage of a laparoscopic simulator among first-year surgical residents' standard simulation curriculum.METHODS: With research ethics board approval, informed consent was obtained from first-year surgical residents enrolled in an introductory surgical simulation curriculum. The class of 2013 served as a control cohort following the standard curriculum which mandates completion of six laparoscopic simulator skill tasks. For the 2014 competition cohort, the only change introduced was the biweekly and monthly posting of a leader board of the top three and ten fastest peg transfer times. Entry surveys were administered assessing attitudes towards simulation-based training and competition. Cohorts were observed for 5 months.RESULTS: There were 24 and 25 residents in the control and competition cohorts, respectively. The competition cohort overwhelmingly (76 %) stated that they were not motivated to deliberate practice by competition. Median total simulator usage time was 132 min (IQR = 214) in the competition cohort compared to 89 (IQR = 170) in the control cohort. The competition cohort completed their course requirements significantly earlier than the control cohort (chi <sup>2</sup> = 6.5, p = 0.01). There was a significantly greater proportion of residents continuing to use the simulator voluntarily after completing their course requirements in the competition cohort (44 vs. 4 %; p = 0.002). Residents in the competition cohort were significantly faster at peg transfer (194 +/- 66 vs. 233 +/- 53 s, 95 % CI of difference = 4-74 s; p = 0.03) and significantly decreased their completion time by 33 +/- 54 s (95 % CI 10-56 s; paired t test, p = 0.007).CONCLUSIONS: A simple serious games skills competition increased voluntary usage and performance on a laparoscopic simulator, despite a majority of participants reporting they were not motivated by competition.

Analysis of Surgical Forces Required to Gain Access Using a Probe for Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery via Cadaveric-Based Experiments Towards Use in Training Simulators,"El-Monajjed, K.; Driscoll, M.","INTRODUCTION: Virtual Reality haptic-based surgical simulators for training purposes have recently been receiving increased traction within the medical field. However, its future adoption is contingent on the accuracy and reliability of the haptic feedback.GOAL: This study describes and analyzes the implementation of a set of haptic-tailored experiments to extract the force feedback of a medical probe used in minimally invasive spinal lumbar interbody fusion surgeries.METHODS: Experiments to extract linear, lateral and rotational insertion, relaxation and extraction of the tool within the spinal muscles, intervertebral discs and lumbar nerve on two cadaveric torsos were conducted.RESULTS: Notably, mean force-displacement and torque-angular displacement curves describing the different tool-tissue responses were reported with a maximum force of 6.87 (+/-1.79) N at 40 mm in the muscle and an initial rupture force through the Annulus Fibrosis of 20.550 (+/-7.841) N at 6.441 mm in the L<sub>4</sub>/L<sub>5</sub> disc.CONCLUSION: The analysis showed that increasing the velocity of the probe slightly reduced and delayed depth of the muscle punctures but significantly lowered the force reduction due to relaxation. Decreasing probe depth resulted with a reduction to the force relaxation drop. However, varying the puncturing angle of attack resulted with a significant effect on increasing force intensities.

M.","OBJECTIVE: To describe and validate a gynecologic laparoscopic-surgery training model.METHODS: The present prospective observational study was conducted at the Minimally Invasive Surgery Centre Jesus Uson, Caceres, Spain, between January 2011 and June 2013. Novice gynecologists attended a 3-day course including simulation and animal training. Participants ' were assessed before and after training using a virtual reality simulator; during training, gynecologists were timed and assessed using an Objective and Structured Assessment of Technical Skills score. The virtual reality simulator-assessed skills were eye-hand coordination, hand-hand coordination, and transference of objects. Participants were asked to rate various elements of the training program using a five-point scale.RESULTS: The study enrolled 21 gynecologists. Participants performed all tasks faster (P<0.001), using fewer movements (P<0.05 for left and right instruments), after receiving training. During participants' final animal and simulator training sessions, completion times were reduced (P<0.001) and assessment scores (P<0.001) increased for all techniques and tasks. Participants considered suturing to be the most useful aspect of the basic-skills training (4.95+/-0.22); animal training received a higher rating than simulator training for practicing new techniques (4.81+/-0.40 vs 4.05+/-0.86) and maintaining skills (4.76+/-0.54 vs 3.95+/-0.97).CONCLUSION: Combining proficiency-based physical simulation and animal training models under expert guidance is an efficient model for improving basic and advanced laparoscopic skills.

Initial validation of a training program focused on laparoscopic radical nephrectomy,"Enciso, S.; Diaz-Guemes, I.; Serrano, A.; Bachiller, J.; Rioja, J.; Uson, J.; Sanchez-Margallo, F. M.","OBJECTIVE: To assess a training model focused on laparoscopic nephrectomy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 16 residents participated in the study, who attended a training program with a theoretical session (1hour) and a dry (7hours) and a wet lab (13hours). During animal training, the first and last nephrectomies were assessed through the completion time and the global rating scale ""Objective and Structured Assessment of Technical Skills"" (OSATS). Before and after the course, they performed 3 tasks on the virtual reality simulator LAPMentor (1) eye-hand coordination; 2) hand-hand coordination; and 3) transference of objects), registering time and movement metrics. All participants completed a questionnaire related to the training components on a 5-point rating scale.RESULTS: The participants performed the last nephrectomy faster (P<.001) and with higher OSATS scores (P<.001). After the course, they completed the LAPMentor tasks faster (P<.05). The number of movements decreased in all tasks (1) P<.001, 2) P<.05, and 3) P<.05), and the path length in tasks 1 (P<.05) and 2 (P<.05). The movement speeds increased in tasks 2 (P<.001) and 3 (P<.001). With regards to the questionnaire, the usefulness of the animal training and the necessity of training on them prior to their laparoscopic clinical practice were the questions with the highest score (4.92+/-.28).CONCLUSIONS: The combination of physical simulation and animal training constitute an effective training model for improving basic and advanced skills for laparoscopic nephrectomy.

High-Fidelity Mannequin Simulation versus Virtual Simulation for Recognition of Critical Events by Student Registered Nurse Anesthetists,"Erlinger, L. R.; Bartlett, A.; Perez, A.","Early recognition of intraoperative critical events is essential in optimizing the health outcomes of surgical patients. Use of simulation in nurse anesthesia education allows students to practice recognizing changes in the patient's condition in a safe learning environment. Second- and third-year student registered nurse anesthetists were randomly assigned to 2 groups to explore differences in recognizing intraoperative myocardial infarction (MI) using highfidelity mannequin simulation vs virtual simulation. One group participated in a virtual simulation first, followed by a high-fidelity mannequin simulation. The other group participated in a high-fidelity mannequin simulation first, then virtual simulation. Second-year students recognized an intraoperative MI faster when using high-fidelity mannequin simulation than when using virtual simulation. However, there was no significant difference among third-year students in the time it took to recognize a critical event when using high-fidelity mannequin simulation vs virtual simulation. These findings indicate that both simulation modalities are useful in evaluating student registered nurse anesthetists' timely recognition of intraoperative critical events such as MI. However, for students with less didactic and clinical practicum experience in the program, such as second-year students, the use of high-fidelity mannequin simulation for recognizing an intraoperative MI may be more beneficial than virtual simulation.",2019,,AANA Journal,87,2,105-109,31587722,,,#6810,Erlinger 2019,,
Exploring virtual reality technology and the Oculus Rift for the examination of digital pathology slides,"Farahani, N.; Post, R.; Duboy, J.; Ahmed, I.; Kolowitz, B. J.; Krinchai, T.; Monaco, S. E.; Fine, J. L.; Hartman, D. J.; Pantanowitz, L.","BACKGROUND: Digital slides obtained from whole slide imaging (WSI) platforms are typically viewed in two dimensions using desktop personal computer monitors or more recently on mobile devices. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any studies viewing digital pathology slides in a virtual reality (VR) environment. VR technology enables users to be artificially immersed in and interact with a computer-simulated world. Oculus Rift is among the world's first consumer-targeted VR headsets, intended primarily for enhanced gaming. Our aim was to explore the use of the Oculus Rift for examining digital pathology slides in a VR environment.METHODS: An Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2) was connected to a 64-bit computer running Virtual Desktop software. Glass slides from twenty randomly selected lymph node cases (ten with benign and ten malignant diagnoses) were digitized using a WSI scanner. Three pathologists reviewed these digital slides on a 27-inch 5K display and with the Oculus Rift after a 2-week washout period. Recorded endpoints included concordance of final diagnoses and time required to examine slides. The pathologists also rated their ease of navigation, image quality, and diagnostic confidence for both modalities.RESULTS: There was 90% diagnostic concordance when reviewing WSI using a 5K display and Oculus Rift. The time required to examine digital pathology slides on the 5K display averaged 39 s (range 10-120 s), compared to 62 s with the Oculus Rift (range 15-270 s). All pathologists confirmed that digital pathology slides were easily viewable in a VR environment. The ratings for image quality and diagnostic confidence were higher when using the 5K display.CONCLUSION: Using the Oculus Rift DK2 to view and navigate pathology whole slide images in a virtual environment is feasible for diagnostic purposes. However, image resolution using the Oculus Rift device was limited.

Simulation-Based Percutaneous Renal Access Training: Evaluating a Novel 3D Immersive Virtual Reality Platform,"Farcas, M.; Reynolds, L. F.; Lee, J. Y.","<b>Introduction:</b> Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the gold standard treatment for patients with a large stone burden. There are a variety of methods to teach this important endourologic procedure, including simulation. We evaluated three different PCNL simulation platforms for potential use in teaching and assessing percutaneous renal access skills. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Urology residents, fellows, and faculty were recruited to participate in this study, which included completing standardized tasks on three PCNL simulation platforms: a virtual reality (VR) simulator (PercMentor, 3D Systems TM), a porcine tissue simulator (Cook TM Medical), and a new 3D immersive VR simulator-Marion K181 (Marion Surgical TM). Participants were asked to complete a standardized task-gaining prone percutaneous renal access using a fluoroscopic-guided technique. Participants were asked to rate the simulators, and performance data were recorded for analysis. <b>Results:</b> A total of 18 participants with varying levels of PCNL experience completed the study. The Marion K181 had higher ratings by participants in all domains (realism, tactile feedback, instrument movement, renal anatomy, fidelity of simulation, utility as teaching tool) compared with the PercMentor (p < 0.05) but did not differ in any domain when compared with the porcine PCNL model. Participants felt that the Marion K181 was comparable with the porcine PCNL model as a teaching tool, but had the advantage of not requiring radiation exposure. Fluoroscopy time was the variable that most consistently correlated with participant PCNL experience and level of training, across all three PCNL simulation platforms. <b>Conclusions:</b> There are a variety of PCNL simulation platforms available for teaching percutaneous renal access skills. Based on our initial comparative study, there is validity evidence to support the use of the novel Marion K181 PCNL simulator as a training tool rather than higher fidelity models requiring real radiation exposure. However, evidence is yet lacking for its use as an assessment tool.",2021,,Journal of Endourology,35,5,695-699,33261507,,,#6845,Farcas 2021,,
Effects of Virtual Reality Simulation on Worker Emergency Evacuation of Neonates,"Farra, S.; Hodgson, E.; Miller, E. T.; Timm, N.; Brady, W.; Gneuhs, M.; Ying, J.; Hausfeld, J.; Cosgrove, E.; Simon, A.; Bottomley, M.","OBJECTIVE: This study examined differences in learning outcomes among newborn intensive care unit (NICU) workers who underwent virtual reality simulation (VRS) emergency evacuation training versus those who received web-based clinical updates (CU). Learning outcomes included a) knowledge gained, b) confidence with evacuation, and c) performance in a live evacuation exercise.METHODS: A longitudinal, mixed-method, quasi-experimental design was implemented utilizing a sample of NICU workers randomly assigned to VRS training or CUs. Four VRS scenarios were created that augmented neonate evacuation training materials. Learning was measured using cognitive assessments, self-efficacy questionnaire (baseline, 0, 4, 8, 12 months), and performance in a live drill (baseline, 12 months). Data were collected following training and analyzed using mixed model analysis. Focus groups captured VRS participant experiences.RESULTS: The VRS and CU groups did not statistically differ based upon the scores on the Cognitive Assessment or perceived self-efficacy. The virtual reality group performance in the live exercise was statistically (P<.0001) and clinically (effect size of 1.71) better than that of the CU group.CONCLUSIONS: Training using VRS is effective in promoting positive performance outcomes and should be included as a method for disaster training. VRS can allow an organization to train, test, and identify gaps in current emergency operation plans. In the unique case of disasters, which are low-volume and high-risk events, the participant can have access to an environment without endangering themselves or clients.

Comparative Cost of Virtual Reality Training and Live Exercises for Training Hospital Workers for Evacuation,"Farra, S. L.; Gneuhs, M.; Hodgson, E.; Kawosa, B.; Miller, E. T.; Simon, A.; Timm, N.; Hausfeld, J.","Adoption of virtual reality technology may be delayed due to high up-front costs with unknown returns on that investment. In this article, we present a cost analysis of using virtual reality as a training tool. Virtual reality was used to train neonatal intensive care workers in hospital evacuation. A live disaster exercise with mannequins was also conducted that approximated the virtual experience. Comparative costs are presented for the planning, development, and implementation of both interventions. Initially, virtual reality is more expensive, with a cost of $229.79 per participant (total cost $18 617.54 per exercise) for the live drill versus $327.78 (total cost $106 951.14) for virtual reality. When development costs are extrapolated to repeated training over 3 years, however, the virtual exercise becomes less expensive with a cost of $115.43 per participant, while the cost of live exercises remains fixed. The larger initial investment in virtual reality can be spread across a large number of trainees and a longer time period with little additional cost, while each live drill requires additional costs that scale with the number of participants.",2019,,"CIN: Computers, Informatics, Nursing",37,9,446-454,31166203,,,#6853,Farra 2019,,

Myomas induce abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain and increase the risk of infertility and obstetrical complications. Symptomatic sub-mucosal myomas are classically treated by hysteroscopic resection. Simulation is a method of education and training. It could improve quality and security of cares. The aim of this study is to assess the interest of a hysteroscopic simulator for the resection of myoma by novice surgeons.METHODS: Twenty medical students were recruited, in a prospective study, in august 2014. The virtual-reality simulator VirtaMed HystSim TM (VirtaMed AG, Zurich, Switzerland) was used to perform the hysteroscopic training. All students received a short demonstration of myoma resection. The practice consists of a submucous myoma type 0 resection. The procedure and the evaluation were performed before and after a specific training in hysteroscopic resection of sixty minutes long. The main outcome criteria were time for the resection before and after training. The second criteria were fluid quantity used, number of contact between optic and uterine cavity and uterine perforation.RESULTS: Twenty students aged from 22 to 24 years were included. The time for the procedure was significantly reduced after training (170s versus 335s, P<0.01). There is the same for fluid quantity used (335 mL versus 717mL, P<0.01) and the number of contact between optic and uterine cavity (0.2 contact versus 3, P=0.012).

Participating centres were contacted to ascertain the date when their surgeons had access to an EyeSi machine and whether this was on-site or off-site. Operations were classified as before, after or no access to EyeSi.SETTING: The study took place in 29 NHS Ophthalmology Units in a secondary care setting.RESULTS: Two-hundred and sixty five first and second year trainee surgeons performed 17 831 cataract operations. 6919 (38.8%) operations were performed before access to an EyeSi, 8648 (48.5%) after access to an EyeSi and 2264 (12.7%) operations by surgeons with no access to an EyeSi. Overall, there was a 38% reduction in the first and second year surgeon's unadjusted PCR rates from 4.2% in 2009 to 2.6% in 2015 for surgeons with access to an EyeSi, and a 3% reduction from 2.9% to 2.8% for surgeons without access to an EyeSi. The overall first and second year unadjusted PCR rates for before, after and no access to EyeSi were 3.5%, 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively. The decrease in the with-access to an EyeSi group PCR rate was similar for surgeons with access to an EyeSi 'on site' or 'off site'.CONCLUSIONS: First and second year trainee surgeons' unadjusted PCR rates have decreased since 2009 which has significant benefits for patients undergoing cataract surgery.

Implementation of a virtual dispensing simulator to support US pharmacy education,"Ferrone, M.; Kebodeaux, C.; Fitzgerald, J.; Holle, L.","INTRODUCTION: A key element for pharmacy practice defined by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) is medication use systems management. A web-based community pharmacy simulation originally created for Australian pharmacy students was adapted for pharmacy students in the United States (US). The objective of this study was to collaboratively adapt an existing international simulation program for utility in the US and measure student perceptions of a web-based community pharmacy simulation program in three US schools of pharmacy.METHODS: An Australian development team in collaboration with US pharmacy school faculty modified the existing MyDispense software to create a virtual environment that accurately represented US community pharmacy practice. Students at three US schools of pharmacy used the newly adapted version of MyDispense and were surveyed on their prior experience in community pharmacy and their perceptions of MyDispense as a learning tool.RESULTS: Overall 241 (44%) students completed the satisfaction survey. Approximately 40% of these students worked in a community pharmacy before starting pharmacy school. Most students agreed or strongly agreed that MyDispense was straightforward to learn (76%), was more realistic than addressing similar paper cases (73%), and offered a learning opportunity to safely make errors (84%). Qualitative thematic analysis revealed that MyDispense allowed students to practice how to gather patient information and ask appropriate questions, counsel patients, and practice the dispensing process.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Response to the US version of My Dispense is positive and proves to be a viable option for introducing and reinforcing community pharmacy practice skills to students during in their pharmacy education.",2017,,Currents in Pharmacy Teaching & Learning,9,4,511-520,29233422,,,#6884,Ferrone 2017,,

The experts involved have backgrounds in virtual reality, general practice, medicines management, medical education and training, ethics, and philosophy.VIEWPOINT: Virtual reality is an unexplored methodology to instigate positive behavioral change among clinicians where other methods have been unsuccessful, such as antimicrobial stewardship. There are several arguments in favor of use of virtual reality in medical education: it can be used for ""difficult to simulate"" scenarios and to standardize a scenario, for example, for use in exams.

Technical Support by Smart Glasses During a Mass Casualty Incident: A Randomized Controlled Simulation Trial on Technically Assisted Triage and Telemedical App Use in Disaster Medicine,"Follmann, A.; Ohligs, M.; Hochhausen, N.; Beckers, S. K.; Rossaint, R.; Czaplik, M.","BACKGROUND: To treat many patients despite lacking personnel resources, triage is important in disaster medicine. Various triage algorithms help but often are used incorrectly or not at all. One potential problem-solving approach is to support triage with Smart Glasses.OBJECTIVE: In this study, augmented reality was used to display a triage algorithm and telemedicine assistance was enabled to compare the duration and quality of triage with a conventional one.METHODS: A specific Android app was designed for use with Smart Glasses, which added information in terms of augmented reality with two different methods-through the display of a triage algorithm in data glasses and a telemedical connection to a senior emergency physician realized by the integrated camera. A scenario was created (ie, randomized simulation study) in which 31 paramedics carried out a triage of 12 patients in 3 groups as follows: without technical support (control group), with a triage algorithm display, and with telemedical contact.RESULTS: A total of 362 assessments were performed. The accuracy in the control group was only 58%, but the assessments were quicker (on average 16.6 seconds). In contrast, an accuracy of 92% (P=.04) was achieved when using technical support by displaying the triage algorithm. This triaging took an average of 37.0 seconds. The triage group wearing data glasses and being telemedically connected achieved 90% accuracy (P=.01) in 35.0 seconds.CONCLUSIONS: Triage with data glasses required markedly more time.

Mastoidectomy Virtual Reality (VR) simulation-based training (SBT) is effective, but SBT of CI surgery largely uninvestigated. The learning curve is imperative for understanding surgical skills acquisition and developing competency-based training. Here, we explore learning curves in VR SBT of CI surgery and transfer of skills to a 3D-printed model.METHODS: Prospective, single-arm trial. Twenty-four novice medical students completed a pre-training CI inserting test on a commercially available pre-drilled 3D-printed temporal bone. A training program of 18 VR simulation CI procedures was completed in the Visual Ear Simulator over four sessions. Finally, a post-training test similar to the pre-training test was completed. Two blinded experts rated performances using the validated Cochlear Implant Surgery Assessment Tool (CISAT).

This study aims to compare UHF VR simulation training with conventional, screen-based VR simulation training (cVR) with respect to performance and cognitive load (CL).METHODS: In a randomized trial with a cross-over design, 24 students completed a total of four mastoidectomies in a VR temporal bone surgical simulator: two performances under UHF conditions using a digital microscope and two performances under conventional conditions using screen-based VR simulation. Performances were assessed by two blinded raters using an established assessment tool. In addition, CL was estimated as the relative change in secondary-task reaction time during simulation when compared with individual baseline measurements. Data were analyzed using linear mixed model analysis for repeated measurements.RESULTS: The mean final-product performance score was significantly lower in UHF VR simulation compared to cVR simulation [mean difference 1.0 points out of 17 points, 95% CI (0.2-1.7), p = 0.02]. The most important factor for performance during UHF simulation was the ability to achieve stereovision (mean difference = 3.4 points, p < 0.001). Under the UHF VR condition, CL was significantly higher than during cVR (28% vs. 18%, respectively, p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: UHF graphics in VR simulation training reduced performance and induced a higher CL in novices than conventional, screen-based VR simulation training.

D.","BACKGROUND: Intracorporeal suturing is one of the most important and difficult procedures in laparoscopic surgery. Practicing on a FLS trainer box is effective but requires large number of consumables, and the scoring is somewhat subjective and not immediate. A virtualbasic laparoscopic skill trainer (VBLaST©) was developed to simulate the five tasks of the FLS Trainer Box. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the face and content validity of the VBLaST suturing simulator (VBLaST-SS©).METHODS: Twenty-five medical students and residents completed an evaluation of the simulator. The participants were asked to perform the standard intracorporeal suturing task on both VBLaST-SS© and the traditional FLS box trainer. The performance scores on each system were calculated based on time (s), deviations to the black dots (mm), and incision gap (mm). The participants were then asked to finish a 13-item questionnaire with ratings from 1 (not realistic/useful) to 5 (very realistic/useful) regarding the face validity of the simulator. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to identify differences in performance on the VBLaST-SS© compared to that of the traditional FLS box trainer.RESULTS: Three questions from the face validity questionnaire were excluded due to lack of response. Ratings to 8 of the remaining 10 questions (80%) averaged above 3.0 out of 5. Average intracorporeal suturing completion time on the VBLaST-SS© was 421 (SD = 168 s) seconds compared to 406 (175 s) seconds on the box trainer (p = 0.620). There was a significant difference between systems for the incision gap (p = 0.048). Deviation in needle insertion from the black dot was smaller for the box trainer than the virtual simulator (1.68 vs. 7.12, p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Participants showed comparable performance on the VBLaST-SS© and traditional box trainer. Overall, the VBLaST-SS© system showed face validity and has the potential to support training for the suturing skills.",2019,,Surgical Endoscopy,33,8,2468-2472,30334151,,,#6956,Fu 2019,,
Use of Virtual Reality to Educate Undergraduate Medical Students on Cardiac Peripheral and Collateral Circulation,"Galvez, R.; Wallon, R. C.; Shackelford, L.; Amos, J. R.; Rowen, J. L.","Many medical schools are looking to utilize virtual reality (VR); however, due to its novelty, we know little about how VR can be effectively used in medical education. This study evaluates a case-centered VR task that supported students with learning peripheral and collateral circulation, anatomical features that are not easily observed in cadavers. Data sources included a quiz, survey, and focus group. Based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, we support the claim that this activity was an effective use of VR and identify features that made it effective, which can guide other educators who are interested in developing VR activities.",2021,,Medical Science Educator,31,1,19-22,34457858,,,#6983,Galvez 2021,,
Use of simulation for education in hospital pharmaceutical technologies: a systematic review,"Garnier, A.; Vanherp, R.; Bonnabry, P.; Bouchoud, L.","OBJECTIVES: Because of the inherent risks facing pharmacy technicians, and consequently also patients, initial and continuing education on hospital pharmaceutical technologies is essential. Simulation is a pedagogical tool now widely used in healthcare education. This study's objectives are to provide an overview of simulation's current place in the field of hospital pharmaceutical technology education, to classify these uses, and to discuss how simulation technologies could be better used in the future.DATA SOURCES: Two pharmacists independently searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science on 21 July 2020 and included studies in English or French that used simulation as an educational tool in the field of hospital pharmaceutical technologies, whether in academic teaching or professional practice.DATA SUMMARY: Our search criteria resulted in 6248 articles, of which 24 were assessed for eligibility and 13 included in the qualitative synthesis. Simulation in hospital pharmaceutical technology education is used in three different ways: first, as a playful pedagogical tool, with error-based simulations (cleanrooms and preparation sheets with errors), or game-based simulations (escape games, role-plays, and board games); second, as an electronic tool with virtual reality (virtual cleanrooms and serious games), or augmented reality (3D glasses); finally, to evaluate chemical contamination (fluorescein and quinine tests) and microbiological contamination (media-fill tests) during compounding to periodically requalify pharmacy technicians.CONCLUSION: Further studies, including non-technical skills evaluations, are needed to confirm the usefulness of this innovative technique in training as efficiently as possible actual and future pharmacy professionals.",2021,,European Journal of Hospital Pharmacy Science & Practice,23,,23,34949651,,,#7026,Garnier 2021,,
"How, for Whom, and in Which Contexts or Conditions Augmented and Virtual Reality Training Works in Upskilling Health Care Workers: Realist Synthesis","Gasteiger, N.; van der Veer, S. N.; Wilson, P.; Dowding, D.","BACKGROUND: Using traditional simulators (eg, cadavers, animals, or actors) to upskill health workers is becoming less common because of ethical issues, commitment to patient safety, and cost and resource restrictions. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) may help to overcome these barriers. However, their effectiveness is often contested and poorly understood and warrants further investigation.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to develop, test, and refine an evidence-informed program theory on how, for whom, and to what extent training using AR or VR works for upskilling health care workers and to understand what facilitates or constrains their implementation and maintenance.METHODS: We conducted a realist synthesis using the following 3-step process: theory elicitation, theory testing, and theory refinement. We first searched 7 databases and 11 practitioner journals for literature on AR or VR used to train health care staff. In total, 80 papers were identified, and information regarding context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) was extracted. We conducted a narrative synthesis to form an initial program theory comprising of CMO configurations. To refine and test this theory, we identified empirical studies through a second search of the same databases used in the first search. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess the quality of the studies and to determine our confidence in each CMO configuration.RESULTS: Of the 41 CMO configurations identified, we had moderate to high confidence in 9 (22%) based on 46 empirical studies reporting on VR, AR, or mixed simulation training programs. These stated that realistic (high-fidelity) simulations trigger perceptions of realism, easier visualization of patient anatomy, and an interactive experience, which result in increased learner satisfaction and more effective learning. Immersive VR or AR engages learners in deep immersion and improves learning and skill performance. When transferable skills and knowledge are taught using VR or AR, skills are enhanced and practiced in a safe environment, leading to knowledge and skill transfer to clinical practice. Finally, for novices, VR or AR enables repeated practice, resulting in technical proficiency, skill acquisition, and improved performance. The most common barriers to implementation were up-front costs, negative attitudes and experiences (ie, cybersickness), developmental and logistical considerations, and the complexity of creating a curriculum. Facilitating factors included decreasing costs through commercialization, increasing the cost-effectiveness of training, a cultural shift toward acceptance, access to training, and leadership and collaboration.CONCLUSIONS: Technical and nontechnical skills training programs using AR or VR for health care staff may trigger perceptions of realism and deep immersion and enable easier visualization, interactivity, enhanced skills, and repeated practice in a safe environment. This may improve skills and increase learning, knowledge, and learner satisfaction. The future testing of these mechanisms using hypothesis-driven approaches is required. Research is also required to explore implementation considerations.",2022,,JMIR Serious Games,10,1,e31644,35156931,,,#7030,Gasteiger 2022,,
The Impact of Virtual Reality Training on the Quality of Real Antromastoidectomy Performance,"Gawecki, W.; Wegrzyniak, M.; Mickiewicz, P.; Gawlowska, M. B.; Talar, M.; Wierzbicka, M.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to analyze the results of virtual reality (VR) antromastoidectomy simulation training and the transferability of the obtained skills to real temporal bone surgery.METHODS: The study was conducted prospectively on a group of 10 physicians, and was composed of five VR simulation training sessions followed by live temporal bone surgery. The quality of performance was evaluated with a Task-Based Checklist (TBC) prepared by John Hopkins Hospital. Additionally, during every VR session, the number and type of mistakes (complications) were noted.RESULTS: The quality of performance measured by the TBC increased significantly during consecutive VR sessions. The mean scores for the first and fifth sessions were 1.84 and 4.27, respectively (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the number of mistakes in consecutive VR sessions was gradually reduced from 11 to 0. During supervised surgery, all the participants were able to perform at least part of an antromastoidectomy, and the mean TBC score was 3.57. There was a significant strong positive correlation between the individual results of the fifth VR session and the individual results of supervised surgery in the operating room (r<sub>p</sub> = 0.89, p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality for temporal bone training makes it possible to acquire surgical skills in a safe environment before performing supervised surgery. Furthermore, the individual final score of virtual antromastoidectomy training allows a prediction of the quality of performance in real surgery.",2020,,Journal of Clinical Medicine,9,10,2,33023129,,,#7033,Gawecki 2020,,
Development of a train-to-proficiency curriculum for the technical skills component of the fundamentals of endoscopic surgery exam,"Gearhart, S.; Marohn, M.; Ngamruengphong, S.; Adrales, G.; Owodunni, O.; Duncan, K.; Petrusa, E.; Lipsett, P.","BACKGROUND: The demonstration of competency in endoscopy is required prior to obtaining American Board of Surgery Certification. To demonstrate competency, the resident must pass a national high-stakes cognitive test and a technical skills exam on a virtual reality simulator. The purpose of this preliminary study was to design a proficiency-based endoscopy simulation curriculum to meet this competency requirement.METHODS: This is a mixed methods prospective cohort study at a single academic medical institution. Prior to taking the national exam, surgery residents were required to participate in a skills lab and demonstrate proficiency on 10 simulation tasks. Proficiency was based on time and percent of objects targeted/mucosa seen. Simulation practice time, number of task repetitions to proficiency, and prior endoscopic experience were recorded. Resident's self-reported confidence scores in endoscopic skills prior to and following simulation lab training were obtained.RESULTS: From January 1, 2016 through August 1, 2017, 20 surgical residents (8 PGY2, 8 PGY3, 4 PGY4) completed both a faculty-supervised endoscopy skills lab and independent learning with train-to-proficiency simulation tasks. Median overall simulator time per resident was 306 min (IQR: 247-405 min). Median overall time to proficiency in all tasks was 235 min (IQR: 208-283 min). The median time to proficiency decreased with increasing PGY status (r = 0.4, P = 0.05). There was no correlation between prior real-time endoscopic experience and time to proficiency. Reported confidence in endoscopic skills increased significantly from mean of 5.75 prior to 7.30 following the faculty-supervised endoscopy skills lab (P = 0.0002). All 20 residents passed the national exam.CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, a train-to-proficiency curriculum in endoscopy improved surgical resident's confidence in their endoscopic skills and 100% of residents passed the FES technical skills test on their first attempt. Our findings also indicate that uniform proficiency was not achieved by real-time experience alone.",2018,,Surgical Endoscopy,32,7,3070-3075,29313124,,,#7035,Gearhart 2018,,

Development and validation of a general and easy assessable scoring system for laparoscopic skills using a virtual reality simulator,"Goderstad, J. M.; Sandvik, L.; Fosse, E.; Lieng, M.","OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a scoring system for laparoscopic skills for five specific tasks on a virtual reality simulator.STUDY DESIGN: A longitudinal, experimental, non-randomised study including 30 gynecologists and gynecological trainees at three hospitals. The participants were categorized as inexperienced (Group 1), moderately experienced (Group 2), and experienced (Group 3). The study participants performed ten repetitions of three basic skill tasks, a salpingectomy and a laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy on a virtual reality simulator. Assessment of skills was based on time, error parameters and economy of movements measured by the simulator. We used the results (mean and SD for each parameter in all tasks) of the four last repetitions performed by the experienced gynecologists as the basic for the scoring system. Performance equal to, and higher than, this mean score gave 2 points. A decrease of 1 SD from the mean gave 1 point. Every score below gave 0 points. The mean score for the inexperienced, moderately experienced and experienced study participants was compared.RESULTS: The mean scores in Task 1 were 3.4 (SD 0.6) in Group 1, 3.4 (SD 0.6) in Group 2 and 5.1 (SD 1.1) in Group 3, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in score between Group 1 and 3 (p = 0.01), and group 2 and 3 (p = 0.01). In Task 2 no statistical significant differences were found. In Task 3, the total mean scores were 1.7 (SD 0.7) in Group 1, 1.9 (SD 0.9) in Group 2 and 2.8 (SD 0.5) in Group 3, respectively.

Augmented reality-based learning for the comprehension of cardiac physiology in undergraduate biomedical students,"Gonzalez, A. A.; Lizana, P. A.; Pino, S.; Miller, B. G.; Merino, C.","The integrated mechanisms of heart contraction are some of the most complex processes for undergraduate biomedical students to understand. Visual models have the potential to enhance learning environments by providing visual representations of complex mechanisms. Despite their benefits, the use of visual models in undergraduate classrooms is still limited. For this study, we tested the effect of a learning sequence of activities related to the cardiac cycle using an augmented reality (AR) application for smartphones and tablets. We were interested in understanding the ability of students to draw and label figures reflecting cardiac function after experiencing the learning sequence using AR. Undergraduate students of the biomedical sciences (control n = 43, experimental n = 58) were enrolled in the course, and their drawings were evaluated using multiple levels of complexity (1 = basic to 5 = complex) through a pre-/posttest structure that included a learning sequence based on AR in the experimental group and regular lecture-based activities in the control group. The complexity of students' drawings was evaluated on the anatomical, physiological, and molecular aspects of heart contraction. We used Cohen's kappa index for interrater reliability when determining the complexity of drawings. Control and experimental groups showed no differences in baseline knowledge (preexamination quiz). The students who experienced the AR activities showed an increase in the complexity of representation levels in posttest results and also showed a significant difference in scores for the final exam in the heart physiology course.

Participants completed demographic and satisfaction questionnaires. Performances at each session were recorded. We compared overall scores at baseline and at the end of the study, and analyzed trends over time. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP by SAS.RESULTS: Overall, 14 subjects completed the training program. In all, 3 (21.4%) were attending physicians and 11 (78.6%) were trainees. There was a significant improvement in the average overall scores (baseline vs. final) in both the D hand (33.4 vs. 46.5; p < 0.05) and the ND hand (28.9 vs. 47.7; p < 0.001). The structured training program demonstrated significantly faster performance times in both hands at the end of the study (D p< 0.001, ND p < 0.02). However, the learning curve was significantly steeper in the ND hand (p < 0.01). Participants agreed that simulation training improved the ND hand dexterity.CONCLUSIONS: We found a significantly greater trend for improvement in the ND compared with the D hand.

Despite the recognized predominant benefits of this app, the students concluded that they do not prefer the total replacement of the physical plaster casts and that a combination of conventional and computer-based education provided the optimum approach to acquisition of dental practical skills.CONCLUSIONS: This survey indicates a generally positive attitude toward computer-assisted simulation systems, providing the facility for acquisition of knowledge and practical skills in a multimedia environment.",2022,,Journal of dental education,86,1,20-Dec,34480346,,,#7127,Gredes 2022,,
Review of automated performance metrics to assess surgical technical skills in robot-assisted laparoscopy,"Guerin, S.; Huaulme, A.; Lavoue, V.; Jannin, P.; Timoh, K. N.","INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted laparoscopy is a safe surgical approach with several studies suggesting correlations between complication rates and the surgeon's technical skills. Surgical skills are usually assessed by questionnaires completed by an expert observer. With the advent of surgical robots, automated surgical performance metrics (APMs)-objective measures related to instrument movements-can be computed. The aim of this systematic review was thus to assess APMs use in robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures. The primary outcome was the assessment of surgical skills by APMs and the secondary outcomes were the association between APM and surgeon parameters and the prediction of clinical outcomes.METHODS: A systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted. PubMed and Scopus electronic databases were screened with the query ""robot-assisted surgery OR robotic surgery AND performance metrics"" between January 2010 and January 2021. The quality of the studies was assessed by the medical education research study quality instrument. The study settings, metrics, and applications were analysed.RESULTS: The initial search yielded 341 citations of which 16 studies were finally included. The study settings were either simulated virtual reality (VR) (4 studies) or real clinical environment (12 studies). Data to compute APMs were kinematics (motion tracking), and system and specific events data (actions from the robot console). APMs were used to differentiate expertise levels, and thus validate VR modules, predict outcomes, and integrate datasets for automatic recognition models. APMs were correlated with clinical outcomes for some studies.CONCLUSIONS: APMs constitute an objective approach for assessing technical skills. Evidence of associations between APMs and clinical outcomes remain to be confirmed by further studies, particularly, for non-urological procedures. Concurrent validation is also required.",2022,,Surgical Endoscopy,36,2,853-870,34750700,,,#7152,Guerin 2022,,

We evaluated the validity of a VH application, MPathic-VR, for assessing performance-based competence in breaking bad news (BBN) to a VH patient.METHODS: We used a two-group quasi-experimental design, with residents participating in a 3-hour seminar on BBN. Group A (n=15) completed the VH simulation before and after the seminar, and Group B (n=12) completed the VH simulation only after the BBN seminar to avoid the possibility that testing alone affected performance. Pre- and postseminar differences for Group A were analyzed with a paired t-test, and comparisons between Groups A and B were analyzed with an independent t-test.RESULTS: Compared to the preseminar result, Group A's postseminar scores improved significantly, indicating that the VH program was sensitive to differences in assessing performance-based competence in BBN. Postseminar scores of Group A and Group B were not significantly different, indicating that both groups performed similarly on the VH program.CONCLUSION: Improved pre-post scores demonstrate acquisition of skills in BBN to a VH patient. Pretest sensitization did not appear to influence posttest assessment.

Here we describe our experience using the social virtual reality (VR) platform Mozilla Hubs for the pre-interview social during the 2020-2021 radiology residency virtual recruitment season, provide results of a survey sent to assess applicants' attitudes towards the VR pre-interview social, and outline additional use-cases for the emerging technology.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VR Meeting Hall dedicated to the pre-interview social was designed in Mozilla Hubs. To assess applicants' impressions of the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social, applicants were sent an optional web-based survey. Survey respondents were asked to respond to a series of eleven statements using a five-point Likert scale of perceived agreement: Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree. Statements were designed to gauge applicants' attitudes towards the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social and its usefulness in helping them learn about the residency program, particularly in comparison with pre-interview socials held on conventional video conferencing software (CVCS).RESULTS: Of the 120 residency applicants invited to the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social, 111 (93%) attended. Of these, 68 (61%) participated in the anonymous survey. Most applicants reported a better overall experience with Mozilla Hubs compared to CVCS (47/68, 69%), with 10% (7/68) reporting a worse overall experience, and 21% (14/68) neutral. Most applicants reported the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social allowed them to better assess residency culture than did pre-interview socials using CVCS (41/68, 60%). Seventy-two percent of applicants reported that the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social positively impacted their decision to strongly consider the residency program (49/68).CONCLUSION: Radiology residency applicants overall preferred a pre-interview social hosted on a social VR platform, Mozilla Hubs, compared to those hosted on CVCS.

The objective of this study was to investigate validity evidence for a virtual reality simulator-based test including multiple lobes of the lungs.METHOD: VATS experts from the department of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, worked with Surgical Science (Gothenburg, Sweden) to develop VATS lobectomy modules for the LapSim<sup> R</sup> virtual reality simulator covering all five lobes of the lungs. Participants with varying experience in VATS were recruited and classified as either novice, intermediate, or experienced surgeons. Each participant performed VATS lobectomy on the simulator for three different randomly chosen lobes. Nine predefined simulator metrics were automatically recorded on the simulator.RESULTS: Twenty-two novice, ten intermediate, and nine experienced surgeons performed the test resulting in a total of 123 lobectomies.

Teaching the management of trauma patients through virtual reality,"Hainsworth, L.; Kosti, A.; Lloyd, A.; Kiddle, A.; Bamford, R.; Hunter, I.","INTRODUCTION: Virtual reality (VR) fully immersive interactive video teaching (VR FIIT) allows learners to develop through observing and interacting with complex realistic environments, developing technical and nontechnical skills. One such complex clinical environment is managing a trauma patient. Despite the significant developments in managing these patients, foundation doctors are frequently highly anxious due to their limited knowledge and experience. The aim of this project was twofold; to improve foundation doctor performance of managing trauma patients and to reduce their associated anxiety, through the use of VR teaching.METHODS: A total of 14 foundation doctors were divided into two groups. One group underwent departmental teaching. The second group underwent departmental teaching and VR FIIT. We assessed the doctors via two methods. First, time taken to complete tasks correctly in trauma simulations was compared. Second, the doctors completed a self-reported level-based assessment questionnaire regarding anxiety and stress around trauma calls.RESULTS: The VR FIIT intervention group were able to complete each task on average 118s faster than the standard group. The standard group missed essential tasks such as C-spine immobilisation. The VR FIIT group self-reported significantly lower levels of anxiety related to trauma calls.CONCLUSION: VR teaching improves foundation doctor performance at managing simulated major trauma patients and decreases foundation doctor anxiety towards management and exposure of these clinical situations.",2022,,Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,104,5,330-333,34928710,,,#7201,Hainsworth 2022,,
Augmented reality in clinical dental training and education,"Haji, Z.; Arif, A.; Jamal, S.; Ghafoor, R.","Dentistry is a profession that requires coordinated motor skills in addition to acquired knowledge for ideal execution of any treatment plan for patients. Learning experiences have been modified over a period of time for students as well as for the healthcare providers. Conventional pre-clinical training employed the use of cadavers, but financial, ethical and supervisory constraints have become a major shortcoming. With the adaptation of technology in dentistry, pre-clinical training has now employed simulation. It provides the opportunity for students to develop psychomotor skills for procedures by practising pre-clinical, standardised learning competencies before they engage in patient-management. Simulation involves computer-aided learning, augmented reality and virtual reality, which are largely taking over pre-clinical teaching. Augmented reality is commonly being employed in maxillofacial, restorative, tooth morphology learning and mastering technique for administering local anaesthesia in dentistry. Virtual reality is being employed particularly in pre-treatment implant planning and dental education for students. Use of haptic technology, like robotics, is also gaining popularity, and facilitates a two-way communication between the user and the environment to better simulate the clinical setting for learning purposes.",2021,,JPMA - Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association,71,Suppl 1)(1,S42-S48,33582722,,,#7204,Haji 2021,,

B.; Chabot-Richards, D. S.; Elliott, R. M.; Kaul, K. L.; Powell, S. Z.; Rao, A.; Rinder, H. M.; Vanderbilt, C. M.; Wilcox, R.","CONTEXT.-: Developing skills related to use of computer-based tools is critical for practicing genomic pathology. However, given the relative novelty of genomics education, residency programs may lack faculty members with adequate expertise and/or time to implement training. A virtual team-based learning (TBL) environment would make genomic pathology education available to more trainees.OBJECTIVE.-: To translate an extensively implemented in-person TBL genomic pathology workshop into a virtual environment and to evaluate both knowledge and skill acquisition.DESIGN.-: Using a novel interactive simulation approach, online modules were developed translating aspects of the TBL experience into the virtual environment with a goal of acquisition of necessary computer-related skills. The modules were evaluated at 10 postgraduate pathology training programs using a pre-post test design with participants deidentified. A postmodule anonymous survey obtained participant feedback on module quality and efficacy.RESULTS.-: There were 147 trainees who received an email request to voluntarily participate in the study. Of these, 43 trainees completed the pretest and 15 (35%) subsequently completed the posttest. Mean overall scores were 45% on the pretest compared with 70% on the posttest ( P < .001; effect size = 1.4). Posttest improvement of results was similar for questions testing acquisition of knowledge versus skills. Regarding the 19 participants who took the survey, 18 (95%) would recommend the modules to others and believed they met the stated objectives.CONCLUSIONS.-: A simulation-based approach allows motivated pathology trainees to acquire computer-related skills for practicing genomic pathology. Future work can explore efficacy in a nonvoluntary setting and adaptation to different specialties, learners, and computer tools.",2019,,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,143,4,513-517,30500295,,,#7262,Haspel 2019,,
Effect of the haptic 3D virtual reality dental training simulator on assessment of tooth preparation,"Hattori, A.; Tonami, K. I.; Tsuruta, J.; Hideshima, M.; Kimura, Y.; Nitta, H.; Araki, K.","BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The haptic 3D virtual reality dental training simulator has been drawn attention as a educational strategy in Covid-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to investigate the feature of the haptics simulator in comparison with a conventional mannequin simulator by analyzing the assessment of products prepared by dental students using these two kinds of simulator.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects were 30 students in the sixth-year classes of the faculty of dentistry. Abutments for a full cast crown were prepared by each subject using two kinds of simulator; one is the haptics simulator and the other is a mannequin simulator. For the resulted products, occlusal surface form, margin design, surface smoothness, taper angle, total cut volume and overall impression were rated by 3 evaluators. Score differences between two simulators were statistically analyzed.RESULTS: The kinds of simulator affected subject performance for margin design and total cut volume. The differences in cutting feeling between the simulators as well as variation of stereoscopic ability in subjects were considerable reasons. Evaluators' rating was affected by difference in simulators for occlusal surface form, total cut volume, and overall impression. This may have been due to variation of stereoscopic ability in evaluators.CONCLUSION: The unique characteristics of virtual reality, such as the simulated cutting sensation and the simulated three-dimensional images created by stereo viewers, affect operators' performance and evaluators' rating. It was suggested that educational programs need to be constructed taking account of the characteristics of virtual reality to make the best use of the haptics simulator.",2022,,Journal of Dental Sciences,17,1,514-520,35028078,,,#7271,Hattori 2022,,

HoloPointer: a virtual augmented reality pointer for laparoscopic surgery training,"Heinrich, F.; Huettl, F.; Schmidt, G.; Paschold, M.; Kneist, W.; Huber, T.; Hansen, C.","PURPOSE: In laparoscopic surgery training, experts guide novice physicians to desired instrument positions or indicate relevant areas of interest. These instructions are usually given via verbal communication or using physical pointing devices. To facilitate a sterile work flow and to improve training, new guiding methods are needed. This work proposes to use optical see-through augmented reality to visualize an interactive virtual pointer on the laparoscopic.METHODS: After an interdisciplinary development, the pointer's applicability and feasibility for training was evaluated and it was compared to a standard condition based on verbal and gestural communication only. In this study, ten surgical trainees were guided by an experienced trainer during cholecystectomies on a laparoscopic training simulator. All trainees completed a virtual cholecystectomy with and without the interactive virtual pointer in alternating order. Measures included procedure time, economy of movement and error rates.RESULTS: Results of standardized variables revealed significantly improved economy of movement (p = 0.047) and error rates (p = 0.047), as well as an overall improved user performance (Total z-score; p = 0.031) in conditions using the proposed method.CONCLUSION: The proposed HoloPointer is a feasible and applicable tool for laparoscopic surgery training.

M.; Bartels, Rhma","Neuroanatomy education is a challenging field which could benefit from modern innovations, such as augmented reality (AR) applications. This study investigates the differences on test scores, cognitive load, and motivation after neuroanatomy learning using AR applications or using cross-sections of the brain. Prior to two practical assignments, a pretest (extended matching questions, double-choice questions and a test on cross-sectional anatomy) and a mental rotation test (MRT) were completed. Sex and MRT scores were used to stratify students over the two groups. The two practical assignments were designed to study (1) general brain anatomy and (2) subcortical structures. Subsequently, participants completed a posttest similar to the pretest and a motivational questionnaire. Finally, a focus group interview was conducted to appraise participants' perceptions. Medical and biomedical students (n = 31); 19 males (61.3%) and 12 females (38.7%), mean age 19.2 +/- 1.7 years participated in this experiment. Students who worked with cross-sections (n = 16) showed significantly more improvement on test scores than students who worked with GreyMapp-AR (P = 0.035) (n = 15). Further analysis showed that this difference was primarily caused by significant improvement on the cross-sectional questions. Students in the cross-section group, moreover, experienced a significantly higher germane (P = 0.009) and extraneous cognitive load (P = 0.016) than students in the GreyMapp-AR group. No significant differences were found in motivational scores. To conclude, this study suggests that AR applications can play a role in future anatomy education as an add-on educational tool, especially in learning three-dimensional relations of anatomical structures.",2020,,Anatomical sciences education,13,3,353-365,31269322,,,#7296,Henssen 2020,,
A Virtual Reality Resident Training Curriculum on Behavioral Health Anticipatory Guidance: Development and Usability Study,"Herbst, R.; Rybak, T.; Meisman, A.; Whitehead, M.; Rosen, B.; Crosby, L. E.; Klein, M. D.; Real, F. J.","BACKGROUND: Behavioral health disorders have steadily increased and been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Though behavioral health disorders can be successfully mitigated with early implementation of evidence-based parent management strategies, education for pediatric residents on behavioral health anticipatory guidance has been limited to date, with training challenges compounded by the physical distancing requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual reality (VR) simulations provide an opportunity to train residents on this complex competency by allowing deliberate practice of necessary skills while adhering to current social distancing guidelines.OBJECTIVE: This study explored the usability of a VR-based behavioral health anticipatory guidance curriculum for pediatric residents.METHODS: This mixed methods study included 14 postgraduate third-year pediatric residents who completed the behavioral health anticipatory guidance VR curriculum. Residents completed the MEC Spatial Presence Questionnaire to assess immersion in the virtual environment. Semistructured interviews were used to elucidate residents' perspectives on the curriculum's content and format. The interviews were analyzed using conventional content analysis.RESULTS: Quantitatively, residents reported a high degree of immersion, spatial presence, and cognitive involvement. Most residents (11/14, 79%) agreed or strongly agreed that it seemed as though they took part in the action of the simulation. Qualitatively, two themes emerged from the data: (1) the curriculum expands behavioral health anticipatory guidance and motivational interviewing knowledge and skills and (2) VR technology is uniquely positioned to develop competence. These themes revealed that the curriculum expanded their current level of knowledge and skill, addressed training gaps, and was applicable to all residents. Additionally, residents experienced VR as immersive, feasible, realistic to the clinic setting, and a safe space to practice and learn new skills.CONCLUSIONS: Pilot data indicates that VR may be an effective tool to teach pediatric residents behavioral health anticipatory guidance, meeting a current gap in medical education training. This VR curriculum is particularly relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic given the increased behavioral health concerns of families.",2021,,JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting,4,2,e29518,34081601,,,#7298,Herbst 2021,,
An Interactive Game with Virtual Reality Immersion to Improve Cultural Sensitivity in Health Care,"Hershberger, P. J.; Pei, Y.; Crawford, T. N.; Neeley, S. M.; Wischgoll, T.; Patel, D. B.; Vasoya, M. M.; Castle, A.; Mishra, S.; Surapaneni, L.; Pogaku, A. A.; Bositty, A.; Pavlack, T.","Purpose: Biased perceptions of individuals who are not part of one's in-groups tend to be negative and habitual. Because health care professionals are no less susceptible to biases than are others, the adverse impact of biases on marginalized populations in health care warrants continued attention and amelioration.Method: Two characters, a Syrian refugee with limited English proficiency and a black pregnant woman with a history of opioid use disorder, were developed for an online training simulation that includes an interactive life course experience focused on social determinants of health, and a clinical encounter in a community health center utilizing virtual reality immersion. Pre- and post-survey data were obtained from 158 health professionals who completed the simulation.Results: Post-simulation data indicated increased feelings of compassion toward the patient and decreased expectations about how difficult future encounters with the patient would be. With respect to attribution, after the simulation participants were less inclined to view the patient as primarily responsible for their situation, suggesting less impact of the fundamental attribution error.Conclusion: This training simulation aimed to utilize components of evidence-based prejudice habit breaking interventions, such as learning more about an individual's life experience to help minimize filling in gaps with stereotyped assumptions. Although training simulations cannot fully replicate or replace the advantages that come with real-world experience, they can heighten awareness in the increase of increasing the cultural sensitivity of clinicians in health care professions for improving health equity.",2022,,Health Equity,6,1,189-197,35402778,,,#7304,Hershberger 2022,,

While recognizing the need for such care, patients and families report home healthcare professionals are unfamiliar with these conditions, which may be driven by neurophobia and may contribute to suboptimal care and early termination of services. We sought to determine the feasibility and effects of a virtual, multimodal educational intervention on PD knowledge, confidence, and empathy among home health professionals.METHODS: Home health nurses, occupational therapists, physical therapists and physical therapy assistants, and speech-language pathologists participated in a daylong, virtual symposium on advanced PD/PRD, combining focused lectures, discipline-specific breakout sessions, immersive virtual reality vignettes, and interactive panels with both patients and families, and movement disorders and home healthcare experts. Participants completed online pre- and post-symposium surveys including: demographics; PD/PRD knowledge (0-10 points possible); empathy (Interpersonal Reactivity Index); and 10-point scales of confidence with and attitudes towards individuals with PD/PRD, respectively. Pre-post intervention changes and effect sizes were evaluated with paired t-tests and Cohen's d. We performed qualitative analyses of post-symposium free-text feedback using a grounded theory approach to identify participants' intentions to change their practice.RESULTS: Participants had a mean improvement of 3.1 points on the PD/PRD knowledge test (p < 0.001, d = 1.97), and improvement in confidence managing individuals with PD/PRD (p = 0.0003, d = .36), and no change in empathy. The interactive, virtual format was rated as effective by 95%. Common themes regarding symposium-motivated practice change included: interdisciplinary collaboration; greater involvement and weighting of the patient and caregiver voice in care plans; attention to visit scheduling in relation to patient function; recognition and practical management of the causes of sudden change in PD/PRD, including infections and orthostatic hypotension.CONCLUSIONS: A virtual, multimodal, brief educational pilot intervention improved PD/PRD-specific knowledge and confidence among home healthcare nurses and allied health professionals.

[Impact of Nurse Practitioners and Nursing Education on COVID-19 Pandemics: Innovative Strategies of Authentic Technology-Integrated Clinical Simulation],"Huang, C. L.","Taiwan Nurses Association and the International Council of Nurses recognize nurse practitioners (NPs) as advanced-practice nurses. A total of 11,266 registered nurses held NP certificates in April 2021 in Taiwan (Tsay, 2021). While international organizations recognize NPs with graduate degrees, over 85% of NPs in Taiwan hold a bachelor degree only. Tsay and Wang (2007) emphasized that NP education in Taiwan should be in step with international trends. Therefore, nursing schools must recruit PhD faculty who hold NP certificates. In addition, complicated and simulation-based learning procedures and teaching plans must be incorporated into the graduate curriculum and clinical practicum to promote the clinical reasoning competences and advanced nursing capabilities of NPs in light of professional training, qualifying examinations, and occupational practice. With the evolution of virtual technology, the strategies for teaching core competences in nursing education have shifted from traditional classroom lectures to online format simulation. Recently, scholars have begun using authentic technology-enhanced clinical simulation to develop and integrate nursing competence to reconceptualize the gap between theory and practice (Weeks et al., 2019). It is increasingly important to teach patient safety, clinical reasoning, and decision-making skills to nursing students using the assistive methods of clinical simulation technology (Aebersold, 2016; Johnsen et al., 2016). Since 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact. In May 2021, clinical practice settings and university campuses in Taiwan were closed following the announcement of a nationwide, level-3 epidemic alert. The Ministry of Education and Taiwan Nurses Association approved the replacement of up to 50% of clinical practicum hours with alternative learning activities. Therefore, faculties require innovative strategies to teach requisite skills and deliver clinical practica online. The faculty members of California State University use virtual clinical education and standardized patient-based telehealth simulations (Shea & Rovera, 2021). In Taiwan, there is a lack of studies in the literature examining the effect of replacing 50% of traditional face-to-face clinical activities with educational alternatives. Prior survey results have demonstrated the efficacy of transitioning to virtual clinical experiences in an online environment for undergraduate and graduate students (Fogg et al., 2020). Moreover, a systematic review provided evidence that virtual simulations support learning outcomes (Foronda et al., 2020). To promote clinical-reasoning competence in graduate students with NP certificates and prepare alternative, virtual-based teaching plans to meet the remaining clinical hours required of students, Fooyin University's School of Nursing has recently established the multi-functional iNursing-Innovative Learning Center. The hardware devices provide interactive virtual patients with character creator 3D, augmented realty (AR) hospital, operating room, intensive care unit, and virtual reality (VR) simulation plans for different nursing divisions as well as editors of electronic book and AR/VR teaching plans. The simulation plans include commercial products and self-design produced by well-trained faculty members. A group of seeding faculty members supported by the Ministry of Education's Higher Education Sprout Project and university funding was tapped to develop a large number of virtual simulation plans. In addition, when developing virtual simulation, it is necessary to follow teaching team discussion and learning objective setting procedures, pre-brief teachers and students, enact plans, conduct debriefing, and collect and evaluate data to explore the learning and teaching process and outcomes (Verkuyl et al., 2021). The nursing clinical practicum continues to be impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In a further study, nursing academic faculty cooperated with clinical preceptors to develop and design education strategies using authentic technology-i",2021,,Hu Li Tsa Chih - Journal of Nursing,68,5,6-Apr,34549401,,,#7387,Huang 2021,,

Highly immersive virtual reality laparoscopy simulation: development and future aspects,"Huber, T.; Wunderling, T.; Paschold, M.; Lang, H.; Kneist, W.; Hansen, C.","PURPOSE: Virtual reality (VR) applications with head-mounted displays (HMDs) have had an impact on information and multimedia technologies. The current work aimed to describe the process of developing a highly immersive VR simulation for laparoscopic surgery.METHODS: We combined a VR laparoscopy simulator (LapSim) and a VR-HMD to create a user-friendly VR simulation scenario. Continuous clinical feedback was an essential aspect of the development process. We created an artificial VR (AVR) scenario by integrating the simulator video output with VR game components of figures and equipment in an operating room. We also created a highly immersive VR surrounding (IVR) by integrating the simulator video output with a [Formula: see text] video of a standard laparoscopy scenario in the department's operating room.RESULTS: Clinical feedback led to optimization of the visualization, synchronization, and resolution of the virtual operating rooms (in both the IVR and the AVR). Preliminary testing results revealed that individuals experienced a high degree of exhilaration and presence, with rare events of motion sickness. The technical performance showed no significant difference compared to that achieved with the standard LapSim.CONCLUSION: Our results provided a proof of concept for the technical feasibility of an custom highly immersive VR-HMD setup.

M.","BACKGROUND: The human white matter pathway network is complex and of critical importance for functionality. Thus, learning and understanding white matter tract anatomy is important for the training of neuroscientists and neurosurgeons. The study aims to test and evaluate a new method for fiber dissection using augmented reality (AR) in a group which is experienced in cadaver white matter dissection courses and in vivo tractography.METHODS: Fifteen neurosurgeons, neurolinguists, and neuroscientists participated in this questionnaire-based study. We presented five cases of patients with left-sided perisylvian gliomas who underwent awake craniotomy. Diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) was performed and the language-related networks were visualized separated in different tracts by color. Participants were able to virtually dissect the prepared DTI FTs using a spatial computer and AR goggles. The application was evaluated through a questionnaire with answers from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).RESULTS: Participants rated the overall experience of AR fiber dissection with a median of 8 points (mean +/- standard deviation 8.5 +/- 1.4).

Augmented Reality Learning Environment for Basic Life Support and Defibrillation Training: Usability Study,"Ingrassia, P. L.; Mormando, G.; Giudici, E.; Strada, F.; Carfagna, F.; Lamberti, F.; Bottino, A.","BACKGROUND: Basic life support (BLS) is crucial in the emergency response system, as sudden cardiac arrest is still a major cause of death worldwide. Unfortunately, only a minority of victims receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from bystanders. In this context, training could be helpful to save more lives, and technology-enhanced BLS simulation is one possible solution.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of our augmented reality (AR) prototype as a tool for BLS training.METHODS: Holo-BLSD is an AR self-instruction training system, in which a standard CPR manikin is ""augmented"" with an interactive virtual environment that reproduces realistic scenarios. Learners can use natural gestures, body movements, and spoken commands to perform their tasks, with virtual 3D objects anchored to the manikin and the environment. During the experience, users were trained to use the device while being guided through an emergency simulation and, at the end, were asked to complete a survey to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed tool (5-point Likert scale; 1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree).RESULTS: The system was rated easy to use (mean 4.00, SD 0.94), and the trainees stated that most people would learn to use it very quickly (mean 4.00, SD 0.89). Voice (mean 4.48, SD 0.87), gaze (mean 4.12, SD 0.97), and gesture interaction (mean 3.84, SD 1.14) were judged positively, although some hand gesture recognition errors reduced the feeling of having the right level of control over the system (mean 3.40, SD 1.04).CONCLUSIONS: We found the Holo-BLSD system to be a feasible and acceptable tool for AR BLS training.",2020,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,22,5,e14910,32396128,,,#7448,Ingrassia 2020,,
Comparison of Experts and Residents Performing a Complex Procedure in a Temporal Bone Surgery Simulator,"Ioannou, I.; Zhou, Y.; Wijewickrema, S.; Piromchai, P.; Copson, B.; Kennedy, G.; O'Leary, S.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of automated metrics from a virtual reality (VR) temporal bone surgery simulator to determine how the performance of experts and trainees differs when performing a complex otological procedure (mastoidectomy with posterior tympanotomy and cochleostomy).STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study.METHODS: Using the University of Melbourne VR temporal bone surgery simulator, seven ENT consultants and seven ENT residents performed two trials of the surgical approach to cochlear implantation on a virtual temporal bone. Simulator recordings were used to calculate a range of automated metrics for each stage of the procedure, capturing efficiency, technique characteristics, drilled bone regions, and damage to vital anatomical structures.RESULTS: Results confirm that experts drilled more efficiently than residents. Experts generally used larger burrs and applied higher forces, resulting in faster material removal. However, they exercised more caution when drilling close to anatomical structures. Residents opened the temporal bone more widely, but neglected important steps in obtaining a clear view toward the round window, such as thinning the external ear canal wall and skeletonizing the medial aspect of the facial nerve. Residents used higher magnification and reoriented the temporal bone more often than experts.CONCLUSION: VR simulation provides metrics that allow the objective analysis of surgical technique, and identification of differences between the performance of surgical residents and their senior colleagues. The performance of residents could be improved with more guidance regarding how much force they should apply, what burr size they should use, how they should orient the bone, and for cochlear implant surgery guidance regarding anatomical regions requiring particular attention, to visualize the round window.",2017,,Otology & Neurotology,38,6,e85-e91,28346293,,,#7451,Ioannou 2017,,
The pathway to a national vascular skills examination and the role of simulation-based training in an increasingly complex specialty,"Irfan, W.; Sheahan, C.; Mitchell, E. L.; Sheahan, M. G., 3rd","The evolving demands of surgical training have led to the successful implementation of skills examinations in the areas of laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery. Currently, there is no similar formal skills assessment in vascular surgery, despite endovascular intervention replacing open surgery in treatment of many vascular conditions. The adoption of less invasive techniques to treat aneurysm and occlusive disease has resulted in new training paradigms and technical challenges for trainees. The duty hour restriction for trainees and declining numbers of complex open vascular interventions have added to the challenges of vascular surgery training. Simulation is a promising avenue for both skills training and assessment. The ability to evaluate the fundamental skills of trainees would be an important step to ensure a degree of uniformity in trainees' technical abilities. The role of simulation-based training in acquiring, testing, and refining these skills is still in its infancy in the vascular surgery training paradigm. This article aims to impart a deeper understanding of the conditions for developing and implementing the fundamentals of vascular and endovascular surgery, and to provide guidance regarding the role of simulation-based training in a rapidly evolving specialty. There are various forms of simulation available, including benchtop models, high-fidelity simulators, and virtual-reality simulators, and each requires a different method of proficiency assessment. Both open surgery and endovascular skills can be assessed and the application of successful implementation in academic vascular surgery training program is presented.",2019,,Seminars in Vascular Surgery,32,2-Jan,48-67,31540657,,,#7454,Irfan 2019,,
Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality in Ophthalmology: A Contemporary Prospective,"Iskander, M.; Ogunsola, T.; Ramachandran, R.; McGowan, R.; Al-Aswad, L. A.","PURPOSE: Most published systematic reviews have focused on the use of virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR) technology in ophthalmology as it relates to surgical training. To date, this is the first review that investigates the current state of VR/AR technology applied more broadly to the entire field of ophthalmology.METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched systematically from January 2014 through December 1, 2020. Studies that discussed VR and/or AR as it relates to the field of ophthalmology and provided information on the technology used were considered. Abstracts, non-peer-reviewed literature, review articles, studies that reported only qualitative data, and studies without English translations were excluded.RESULTS: A total of 77 studies were included in this review. Of these, 28 evaluated the use of VR/AR in ophthalmic surgical training/assessment and guidance, 7 in clinical training, 23 in diagnosis/screening, and 19 in treatment/therapy. 15 studies used AR, 61 used VR, and 1 used both. Most studies focused on the validity and usability of novel technologies.CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmology is a field of medicine that is well suited for the use of VR/AR. However, further longitudinal studies examining the practical feasibility, efficacy, and safety of such novel technologies, the cost-effectiveness, and medical/legal considerations are still needed. We believe that time will indeed foster further technological advances and lead to widespread use of VR/AR in routine ophthalmic practice.",2021,,Asia-Pacific Journal of Ophthalmology,10,3,244-252,34383716,,,#7456,Iskander 2021,,
A new option for education during surgical procedures and related clinical anatomy in a virtual reality workspace,"Iwanaga, J.; Kamura, Y.; Nishimura, Y.; Terada, S.; Kishimoto, N.; Tanaka, T.; Tubbs, R. S.","The COVID-19 pandemic and mandatory social distancing has brought challenges to anatomy educators who generally need in-person classes. The purpose of this study is to share the experience of a distant online lecture on a surgical procedure and related anatomy in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) workspace and to compare it with reported teaching methods, that is, an in-person class and a Zoom online class. The lecture was delivered by three authors of this article in a VR workspace that enables people to meet through VR. The lectures were about combinations of dental surgical procedures and related clinical anatomy. Physically, the attendees could have been located anywhere in the world, so lecturers joined from the United States and the attendees were all from Japan. VR environment and its flexibility enabled attendees to join the lecture actively, helping them to gain understanding of the surgical procedure and anatomy more efficiently. The use of VR technology with a live communication tool demonstrated in this study has several advantages over previous education methods, although there are still technical issues or disadvantages that need to be addressed. Development of the technology and app/software is required so that more data can be processed at higher speed. Use of VR technology with a live communication tool could be an alternative teaching method. Its overall advantages are a closer look at the slides/monitor and concurrent observation of the multiple assets in various directions by multiple attendees. These advantages cannot be achieved by any other teaching method without VR assets with the workspace provided by Spatial. Even during the mandatory social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this could enable us to foster 3D understanding of surgery and related anatomy. Further study is now needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this newly proposed teaching method by comparing it with traditional in-person and online classes with a live communication tool.",2021,,Clinical Anatomy,34,3,496-503,33502787,,,#7467,Iwanaga 2021,,
Improving Shared Decision Making Between Patients and Clinicians: Design and Development of a Virtual Patient Simulation Tool,"Jacklin, S.; Maskrey, N.; Chapman, S.","BACKGROUND: Shared decision making (SDM) involves the formation of a collaborative partnership between the patient and clinician combining both of their expertise in order to benefit decision making. In order for clinicians to be able to carry out this skilled task, they require practice. Virtual reality, in the form of a virtual patient, could offer a potential method of facilitating this.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to create a virtual patient that simulated a primary care consultation, affording the opportunity to practice SDM. A second aim was to involve patients in the design of a virtual patient simulation and report the process of the design.METHODS: We employed a multistep design process drawing on patient and expert involvement.RESULTS: A virtual patient, following a narrative style, was built, which allows a user to practice and receive feedback; both clinical and communication skills are required for the simulation. The patient group provided multiple insights, which the academic team had overlooked. They pertained mostly to issues concerning the patient experience.CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to design a virtual patient that allows a learner to practice their ability to conduct SDM.

High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been associated with improved outcomes yet adherence to guidelines is poor. We developed and tested an augmented reality head mounted display chest compression (CC) feedback system (AR-CPR) designed to provide real-time CC feedback and guidance.Methods: We conducted an unblinded randomized crossover simulation-based study to determine whether AR-CPR changes a user's CC performance. A convenience sample of healthcare providers who perform CC on children were included. Subjects performed three two-minute cycles of CC during a simulated 18-minute paediatric cardiac arrest. Subjects were randomized to utilize AR-CPR in the second or third CC cycle. After, subjects participated in a qualitative portion to inquire about their experience with AR-CPR and offer criticisms and suggestions for future development.Results: There were 34 subjects recruited. Sixteen subjects were randomly assigned to have AR-CPR in cycle two (Group A) and 18 subjects were randomized to have AR-CPR in cycle three (Group B). There were no differences between groups CC performance in cycle one (baseline). In cycle two, subjects in Group A had 73% (SD 18%) perfect CC epochs compared to 17% (SD 26%) in Group B (p < 0.001).

H.; Neckelmann, K.; Vad, H.; Moller, L. B.; Pedersen, J. H.; Konge, L.","BACKGROUND: Competency-based training has gained ground in surgical training and with it assessment tools to ensure that training objectives are met. Very few assessment tools are available for evaluating performance in thoracoscopic procedures. Video recordings would provide the possibility of blinded assessment and limited rater bias. This study aimed to provide validity evidence for a newly developed and dedicated tool for assessing competency in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) lobectomy.METHODS: Participants with varying experience with VATS lobectomy were included from different countries. Video recordings from participants' performance of a VATS right upper lobe lobectomy on a virtual reality simulator were rated by three raters using a modified version of a newly developed VATS lobectomy assessment tool (the VATSAT) and analyzed in relation to the unitary framework (content, response process, internal structure, relation to other variables, and consequences of testing).RESULTS: Fifty-three participants performed two consecutive simulated VATS lobectomies on the virtual reality simulator, leaving a total of 106 videos. Content established in previously published studies. Response process Standardized data collection was ensured by using an instructional element, uniform data collection, a special rating program, and automatic generation of the results to a database. Raters were carefully instructed in using the VATSAT, and tryout ratings were carried out. Internal structure Inter-rater reliability was calculated as intra-class correlation coefficients, to 0.91 for average measures (p < 0.001). Test/re-test reliability was calculated as Pearson's r of 0.70 (p < 0.001). G-coefficient was calculated to be 0.79 with two procedures and three raters. By performing D-theory was found that either three procedures rated by two raters or five procedures rated by one rater were enough to reach an acceptable G-coefficient of >= 0.8.

The aims of this study were to explore RT and MP students' perceptions of working as part of a collaborative team and of their own and the other group's professional roles. Student perceptions of the simulation education tool, the virtual environment for radiotherapy training (VERT) system, were also investigated.METHODS: RT and MP students were invited to participate in a 4-hour interprofessional workshop. Pre- and post-workshop surveys were employed to collect demographic data, students' perceptions of interdisciplinary education (interdisciplinary education perception scale (IEPS)) and workshop evaluation (bespoke questionnaire).RESULTS: Fifteen students attended the workshop (RT, n = 8; MP, n = 7). Thirteen pre- and post-questionnaires were returned (Pre-questionnaire: RT, n = 6, response rate, 75%; MP, n = 7, response rate, 100%; post-questionnaire: RT, n = 7, response rate, 87.5%; MP, n = 6, response rate 85.7%). For both student groups combined, IEPS scores ranged from 64 to 108 and 71 to 108 in the pre- and post-questionnaires, respectively, with insignificant differences in the mean scores post-intervention (Z = -1.305, P = 0.192). Satisfaction with VERT as a simulation tool was high for both student groups.CONCLUSIONS: The interprofessional student workshop served to promote interprofessional collaboration for RT and MP students. VERT was reported as an appropriate education tool for this purpose, enabling access to virtual clinical equipment common to both student groups. It is suggested that IPE continues to be offered and investigated in RT and MP students, in order to improve effective interprofessional strategies which may enrich future professional collaboration.",2018,,Journal of Medical Radiation Sciences,65,2,106-113,29359415,,,#7535,Jimenez 2018,,
Dental Decision Simulation (DDSim): Development of a virtual training environment,"Johnson, K. S.; Schmidt, A. M.; Bader, J. D.; Spallek, H.; Rindal, D. B.; Enstad, C. J.; Fricton, J. R.; Asche, S. E.; Kane, S. M.; Thirumalai, V.; Godlevsky, O. V.; Johnson, N. J.; Acharya, A.; Rush, W. A.","PURPOSE: Case-based simulations are powerful training tools that can enhance learning and drive behavior change. This is an overview of the design/development of Dental Decision Simulation (DDSim), a web-based simulation of an electronic dental record (EDR). The purpose was to use DDSim to train dentists to make evidence-based treatment planning decisions consistent with current evidence. This simulated EDR provides case-based information in support of a set of defined evidence-based learning objectives.METHODS: The development of this complex simulation model required coordinated efforts to create several components: identify behavior changes, case authoring mechanism, create virtual patient visits, require users to make treatment plan decisions related to learning objectives, and a feedback mechanism to help users recognize departures from those learning objectives. This simulation was evaluated in a 2-arm, clinic-randomized, controlled pilot study examining the extent to which DDSim changed dentists' planned treatment to conform to evidence-based treatment guidelines relative to change in dentists not exposed to DDSim. Outcomes were measured by comparing preintervention and postintervention patient EDR treatment data.RESULTS: Changes in behavior over time did not favor intervention or control clinics.CONCLUSION: DDSim provides a standardized learning platform that cannot be achieved through the use of live patients. Both live patients and case-based simulations can be used to transfer knowledge and skill development. DDSim offers the advantage of providing a platform for developing treatment planning skills in a low-risk environment. However, further research examining behavior change is needed.",2020,,Journal of dental education,84,11,1284-1293,32702778,,,#7547,Johnson 2020,,
Radiation Oncology Virtual Education Rotation (ROVER) for Medical Students,"Kahn, J. M.; Sandhu, N.; von Eyben, R.; Deig, C.; Obeid, J. P.; Miller, J. A.; Pollom, E.","PURPOSE: We describe the implementation of a novel virtual educational program for medical students, Radiation Oncology Virtual Education Rotation (ROVER), and its effect on student interest and knowledge in radiation oncology.METHODS AND MATERIALS: ROVER comprised a series of virtual educational panels with case-based discussions across disease sites tailored to medical students. The panels were moderated by radiation oncology residents and included faculty panelists from academic radiation oncology programs across the country. Student pre- and postsession surveys were collected. Paired t tests were used to compare the pre- and postsession assessment results.RESULTS: Six ROVER sessions were held from June 4, 2020, to August 20, 2020, with a total of 427 medical students registering for at least 1 session. Of these, 231 students attended at least 1 session, with 140 completing at least 1 postsession survey (60.6% response rate). Fourth-year medical students were the largest group represented among attendees (32.0%). Most attendees had exposure to radiation oncology (78.8%) before the sessions. The majority of students signed up for these sessions for education (90.6%). Some students signed up for the sessions to help with specialty selection (30.9%) and to network (30.4%). Medical students' understanding of the role of radiation oncology in each disease site (breast, sarcoma, central nervous system, pediatrics, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecologic, lymphoma, lung, and head and neck) was improved by attending each session (pre- vs postsession; P < .0001 for all disease sites). Over three-quarters of respondents stated they were considering applying or were likely to apply to radiation oncology both before and after the sessions.CONCLUSIONS: ROVER improved medical student perceived knowledge of radiation oncology across all disease sites covered. ROVER fulfills a need for a national medical student education platform for radiation oncology. Future work is warranted to augment virtual and open educational platforms to improve access to radiation oncology education.",2021,,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",111,1,29-35,33845145,,,#7580,Kahn 2021,,
[Existing laparoscopic simulators and their benefit for the surgeon],"Kalvach, J.; Ryska, O.; Ryska, M.","INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, laparoscopic operations are a common part of surgical practice. However, they have their own characteristics and require a specific method of preparation. Recently, simulation techniques have been increasingly used for the training of skills. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of available literature on the topic of laparoscopic simulators, to assess their contribution to the training of surgeons, and to identify the most effective type of simulation.METHODS: PubMed database, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were used to search for relevant publications. The keywords ""laparoscopy, simulator, surgery, assessment"" were used in the search. The search was limited to prospective studies published in the last 5 years in the English language.RESULTS: From a total of 354 studies found, we included in the survey 26 that matched our criteria. Nine studies compared individual simulators to one another. Five studies evaluated ""high and low fidelity"" (a virtual box simulator) as equally effective (EBM 2a). In three cases the ""low fidelity"" box simulator was found to be more efficient (EBM 2a3b). Only one study preferred the virtual simulator (VR) (EBM2b). Thirteen studies evaluated the benefits of simulators for practice. Twelve found training on a simulator to be an effective method of preparation (EBM 1b3b). In contrast, one study did not find any difference between the training simulator and traditional preparation (EBM 3b). Nine studies evaluated directly one of the methods of evaluating laparoscopic skills. Three studies evaluated VR simulator as a useful assessment tool. Other studies evaluated as successful the scoring system GOALS-GH. The hand motion analysis model was successful in one case. Most studies were observational (EBM 3b) and only 2 studies were of higher quality (EBM 2b).CONCLUSION: Simulators are an effective tool for practicing laparoscopic techniques (EBM: 1b). It cannot be determined based on available data which of the simulators is most effective. The virtual simulator, however, still remains the most self-sufficient unit suitable for teaching as well as evaluation of laparoscopic techniques (EBM 2b3b). Further studies are needed to find an effective system and parameters for an objective evaluation of skills.KEY WORDS: laparoscopy - simulator - surgery assessment.",2016,,Rozhledy V Chirurgii,95,1,12-Apr,26982186,,,#7588,Kalvach 2016,,

Mixed reality-based online interprofessional education: a case study in South Korea,"Kang, Y. J.; Kang, Y.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore undergraduate medical and nursing students' satisfaction with their mixed reality (MR)-based online interprofessional learning experience in South Korea.METHODS: This study used a case study design. A convenience sample of 30 participants (i.e., 15 third-year medical students and 15 fourth-year nursing students) participated in a 120-minute MR-based online interprofessional education (IPE) that consisted of visualization of holographic standardized patient with ischemic stroke, online interprofessional activity, and debriefing and reflection sessions. Following the MR-based online IPE, data were collected through Modified Satisfaction with Simulation Experience Scale survey and were analyzed using descriptive analyses and independent t-tests.RESULTS: Although medical and nursing students were highly satisfied with MR-based online interprofessional learning experience, nursing students were significantly more satisfied with it compared with medical students.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the integration of MR and online approach through the structured clinical reasoning process in undergraduate health professions programs can be used as an educational strategy to improve clinical reasoning and critical thinking and to promote interprofessional understanding.",2022,,Korean journal of medical education,34,1,63-69,35255617,,,#7603,Kang 2022,,
"The Effects of Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality as Training Enhancement Methods: A Meta-Analysis","Kaplan, A. D.; Cruit, J.; Endsley, M.; Beers, S. M.; Sawyer, B. D.; Hancock, P. A.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis is to explore the presently available, empirical findings on transfer of training from virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed reality (MR) and determine whether such extended reality (XR)-based training is as effective as traditional training methods.BACKGROUND: MR, VR, and AR have already been used as training tools in a variety of domains. However, the question of whether or not these manipulations are effective for training has not been quantitatively and conclusively answered. Evidence shows that, while extended realities can often be time-saving and cost-saving training mechanisms, their efficacy as training tools has been debated.METHOD: The current body of literature was examined and all qualifying articles pertaining to transfer of training from MR, VR, and AR were included in the meta-analysis. Effect sizes were calculated to determine the effects that XR-based factors, trainee-based factors, and task-based factors had on performance measures after XR-based training.RESULTS: Results showed that training in XR does not express a different outcome than training in a nonsimulated, control environment. It is equally effective at enhancing performance.CONCLUSION: Across numerous studies in multiple fields, extended realities are as effective of a training mechanism as the commonly accepted methods. The value of XR then lies in providing training in circumstances, which exclude traditional methods, such as situations when danger or cost may make traditional training impossible.",2021,,Human factors,63,4,706-726,32091937,,,#7606,Kaplan 2021,,

Radiography education with VR using head mounted display: proficiency evaluation by rubric method,"Kato, K.; Kon, D.; Ito, T.; Ichikawa, S.; Ueda, K.; Kuroda, Y.","BACKGROUND: The use of head mounted display (HMD)-based immersive virtual reality (VR) coaching systems (HMD-VRC) is expected to be effective for skill acquisition in radiography. The usefulness of HMD-VRC has been reported in many previous studies. However, previous studies have evaluated the effectiveness of HMD-VRC only through questionnaires. HMD-VRC has difficulties in palpation and patient interaction compared to real-world training. It is expected that these issues will have an impact on proficiency. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of VR constraints in HMD-VRC, especially palpation and patient interaction, on radiographic skills proficiency in a real-world setting.METHODS: First-year students (n = 30) at a training school for radiology technologists in Japan were randomly divided into two groups, one using HMD-VRC (HMD-VRC group) and the other practicing with conventional physical equipment (RP group) and trained for approximately one hour. The teachers then evaluated the students for proficiency using a rubric method.RESULTS: In this study, it was found that some skills in the HMD-VRC group were equivalent to those of the RP group and some were significantly lower than those of the RP group. There was a significant decrease in proficiency in skills related to palpation and patient interaction.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that HMD-VRC can be less effective than real-world training in radiographic techniques, which require palpation and patient interaction. For effective training, it is important to objectively evaluate proficiency in the real world, even for HMD-VRC with new technologies, such as haptic presentation and VR patient interaction.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was conducted with the approval of the Ethics Committee of International University of Health and Welfare (Approval No.21-Im-035, Registration date: September 28, 2021).",2022,,BMC medical education,22,1,579,35902953,,,#7623,Kato 2022,,
Utilization of a Voice-Based Virtual Reality Advanced Cardiac Life Support Team Leader Refresher: Prospective Observational Study,"Katz, D.; Shah, R.; Kim, E.; Park, C.; Shah, A.; Levine, A.; Burnett, G.","BACKGROUND: The incidence of cardiac arrests per year in the United States continues to increase, yet in-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates significantly vary between hospitals. Current methods of training are expensive, time consuming, and difficult to scale, which necessitates improvements in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) training. Virtual reality (VR) has been proposed as an alternative or adjunct to high-fidelity simulation (HFS) in several environments. No evaluations to date have explored the ability of a VR program to examine both technical and behavioral skills and demonstrate a cost comparison.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the utility of a voice-based VR ACLS team leader refresher as compared with HFS.METHODS: This prospective observational study performed at an academic institution consisted of 25 postgraduate year 2 residents. Participants were randomized to HFS or VR training and then crossed groups after a 2-week washout. Participants were graded on technical and nontechnical skills. Participants also completed self-assessments about the modules. Proctors were assessed for fatigue and task saturation, and cost analysis based on local economic data was performed.RESULTS: A total of 23 of 25 participants were included in the scoring analysis. Fewer participants were familiar with VR compared with HFS (9/25, 36% vs 25/25, 100%; P<.001). Self-reported satisfaction and utilization scores were similar; however, significantly more participants felt HFS provided better feedback: 99 (IQR 89-100) vs 79 (IQR 71-88); P<.001. Technical scores were higher in the HFS group; however, nontechnical scores for decision making and communication were not significantly different between modalities. VR sessions were 21 (IQR 19-24) min shorter than HFS sessions, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index scores for proctors were lower in each category, and VR sessions were estimated to be US $103.68 less expensive in a single-learner, single-session model.CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of a VR-based team leader refresher for ACLS skills is comparable with HFS in several areas, including learner satisfaction. The VR module was more cost-effective and was easier to proctor; however, HFS was better at delivering feedback to participants. Optimal education strategies likely contain elements of both modalities. Further studies are needed to examine the utility of VR-based environments at scale.",2020,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,22,3,e17425,32163038,,,#7625,Katz 2020,,
Assessing the Impact of a Virtual Lab in an Allied Health Program,"Kay, R.; Goulding, H.; Li, J.","Competency-based education in health care requires rigorous standards to ensure professional proficiency. Demonstrating competency in hands-on laboratories calls for effective preparation, knowledge, and experience, all of which can be difficult to achieve using traditional teaching methods. Virtual laboratories are an alternative, cost-effective approach to providing students with sufficient preparatory information. Research on the use of virtual labs in allied health education is limited. The current study investigated the benefits, challenges, and perceived impact of a virtual lab in an allied health program. The sample consisted of 64 students (55 females, 9 males) enrolled in a university medical laboratory science program. A convergent mixed-methods approach (Likert survey, open-ended questions, think-aloud protocol data) revealed that students had positive attitudes towards visual learning, authenticity, learner control, organization, and scaffolding afforded by the virtual lab. Challenges reported included navigational difficulties, an absence of control over content selection, and lack of understanding for certain concepts. Over 90% of students agreed that the virtual lab helped them prepare for hands-on laboratory sessions and that they would use this format of instruction again. Overall, 84% of the students agreed that the virtual lab helped them to achieve greater success in learning.",2018,,Journal of allied health,47,1,45-50,29504019,,,#7633,Kay 2018,,

P.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) with head-mounted displays (HMD) may improve medical training and patient care by improving display and integration of different types of information. The aim of this study was to evaluate among different healthcare professions the potential of an interactive and immersive VR environment for liver surgery that integrates all relevant patient data from different sources needed for planning and training of procedures.METHODS: 3D-models of the liver, other abdominal organs, vessels, and tumors of a sample patient with multiple hepatic masses were created. 3D-models, clinical patient data, and other imaging data were visualized in a dedicated VR environment with an HMD (IMHOTEP). Users could interact with the data using head movements and a computer mouse. Structures of interest could be selected and viewed individually or grouped. IMHOTEP was evaluated in the context of preoperative planning and training of liver surgery and for the potential of broader surgical application. A standardized questionnaire was voluntarily answered by four groups (students, nurses, resident and attending surgeons).RESULTS: In the evaluation by 158 participants (57 medical students, 35 resident surgeons, 13 attending surgeons and 53 nurses), 89.9% found the VR system agreeable to work with. Participants generally agreed that complex cases in particular could be assessed better (94.3%) and faster (84.8%) with VR than with traditional 2D display methods. The highest potential was seen in student training (87.3%), resident training (84.6%), and clinical routine use (80.3%). Least potential was seen in nursing training (54.8%).CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that using VR with HMD to integrate all available patient data for the preoperative planning of hepatic resections is a viable concept.

M.; Lin, P.; Al-Mazroui, A.; Chana, B.; Kalaichandran, R.; Lee, W.; Grantcharov, T. P.; Grover, S. C.","BACKGROUND: Non-technical skills (NTS), such as communication and professionalism, contribute to the safe and effective completion of procedures. NTS training has previously been shown to improve surgical performance. Moreover, increases in NTS have been associated with improved clinical endoscopic performance. Despite this evidence, NTS training has not been tested as an intervention in endoscopy.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a simulation-based training (SBT) curriculum of NTS on novice endoscopists' performance of clinical colonoscopy.METHODS: Novice endoscopists were randomized to 2 groups. The control group received 4 hours of interactive didactic sessions on colonoscopy theory and 6 hours of SBT. Hours 5 and 6 of the SBT were integrated scenarios, wherein participants interacted with a standardized patient and nurse, while performing a colonoscopy on the virtual reality (VR) simulator. The NTS (intervention) group received the same teaching sessions but the last hour was focused on NTS teaching. The NTS group also reviewed a checklist of tasks relevant to NTS concepts prior to each integrated scenario case and was provided with dedicated feedback on their NTS performance during the integrated scenario practice. All participants were assessed at baseline, immediately after training, and 4 to 6 weeks post-training. The primary outcome measure is colonoscopy-specific performance in the clinical setting.RESULTS: In total, 42 novice endoscopists completed the study. Data collection and analysis is ongoing. We anticipate completion of all assessments by August 2017. Data analysis, manuscript writing, and subsequent submission for publication is expected to be completed by December 2017.CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study may inform the implementation of NTS training into postgraduate gastrointestinal curricula. NTS curricula may improve attitudes towards patient safety and self-reflection among trainees.

Testing the Construct Validity of a Virtual Reality Hip Arthroscopy Simulator,"Khanduja, V.; Lawrence, J. E.; Audenaert, E.","PURPOSE: To test the construct validity of the hip diagnostics module of a virtual reality hip arthroscopy simulator.METHODS: Nineteen orthopaedic surgeons performed a simulated arthroscopic examination of a healthy hip joint using a 70degree arthroscope in the supine position. Surgeons were categorized as either expert (those who had performed 250 hip arthroscopies or more) or novice (those who had performed fewer than this). Twenty-one specific targets were visualized within the central and peripheral compartments; 9 via the anterior portal, 9 via the anterolateral portal, and 3 via the posterolateral portal. This was immediately followed by a task testing basic probe examination of the joint in which a series of 8 targets were probed via the anterolateral portal. During the tasks, the surgeon's performance was evaluated by the simulator using a set of predefined metrics including task duration, number of soft tissue and bone collisions, and distance travelled by instruments. No repeat attempts at the tasks were permitted. Construct validity was then evaluated by comparing novice and expert group performance metrics over the 2 tasks using the Mann-Whitney test, with a P value of less than .05 considered significant.RESULTS: On the visualization task, the expert group outperformed the novice group on time taken (P = .0003), number of collisions with soft tissue (P = .001), number of collisions with bone (P = .002), and distance travelled by the arthroscope (P = .02). On the probe examination, the 2 groups differed only in the time taken to complete the task (P = .025) with no significant difference in other metrics.CONCLUSIONS: Increased experience in hip arthroscopy was reflected by significantly better performance on the virtual reality simulator across 2 tasks, supporting its construct validity.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study validates a virtual reality hip arthroscopy simulator and supports its potential for developing basic arthroscopic skills.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.",2017,,Arthroscopy,33,3,566-571,27993463,,,#7664,Khanduja 2017,,

Development of virtual reality content for learning Japan Prehospital Trauma Evaluation and Care initial assessment procedures,"Kiyozumi, T.; Ishigami, N.; Tatsushima, D.; Araki, Y.; Sekine, Y.; Saitoh, D.","Aim: The Japan Prehospital Trauma Evaluation and Care (JPTEC) is a standardized educational program for prehospital trauma care in Japan. The initial assessment in the JPTEC course comprises a training segment that includes a 30-min session. Given the limited face-to-face training due to the coronavirus disease 2019, virtual reality (VR) content has become an alternative. However, creating VR content typically requires the assistance of expert technicians. We aimed to create VR content for the initial assessment segment of the JPTEC and verify its educational effectiveness.Methods: We created VR content for learning the initial assessment of the JPTEC using our easy-to-use VR content creation system. The participants played the VR content for 15 min. The number of times they ""cleared"" (i.e., made a correct decision and completed the initial assessment) was recorded every 5 min. Then, a JPTEC-certified instructor tested their practical skills through face-to-face simulation.Results: The authors had no specialized skills and created the VR content in 2 days. Fourteen students used the material. They cleared the scenario 3 (3-4) times in the first 5 min in 15 min, 5 (4-5) times in the second 5 min, and 5 (5-5) times in the third 5 min (P < 0.05).

Effectiveness of the Use of Augmented Reality in Teaching the Management of Anaphylactic Shock at the Primary Care Level: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Klemenc-Ketis, Z.; Poplas Susic, A.; Ruzic Gorenjec, N.; Mirosevic, S.; Zafosnik, U.; Selic, P.; Tevzic, S.","BACKGROUND: Augmented reality (AR) has benefits and feasibility in emergency medicine, especially in the clinical care of patients, in operating rooms and inpatient facilities, and in the education and training of emergency care providers, but current research on this topic is sparse.OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness of the use of AR in the treatment of patients with anaphylactic shock. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety in the treatment of patients with anaphylactic shock, evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness of stress management in this process, and determine the experiences and attitudes towards the use of AR in education.METHODS: The study will be conducted in 3 phases. In the first phase, we will develop and test the scenario for simulation of anaphylactic shock and the evaluation scale for assessing the effect of the intervention. In the second phase, a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial will be conducted. In the third phase, the use of AR in teaching the management of anaphylactic shock using focus groups will be evaluated qualitatively. All participants will participate in a 1-day training program consisting of a lecture on emergency care and anaphylactic shock as well as exercises in manual dexterity (aspiration, airway management, alternative airway management, artificial respiration, chest compressions, safe defibrillation, oxygen application, use of medication during emergency care). The test group will also focus on education about anaphylactic shock in AR (the intervention). The main outcome will be the evaluation of the participants' performance in coping with a simulated scenario of anaphylactic shock using a high-fidelity simulator (simulator with high levels of realism) and a standardized patient in an educational and clinical environment. The study will be conducted with primary care physicians.RESULTS: A scenario for the simulation with a high-fidelity simulator and standardized patient has already been developed. For the time being, we are developing an evaluation scale and starting to recruit participants. We plan to complete the recruitment of participants by the end of December 2020, start the randomized controlled trial in January 2021, and finish 1 year later. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2021.CONCLUSIONS: This will be the first study to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of AR in medical teaching. Specifically, it will be based on a clinical case of anaphylactic shock at the primary care level. With our study, we also want to evaluate the translation of these educational results into clinical practice and assess their long-term impact.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN58047410; http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN58047410.International registered report identifier (irrid): Prr1-10.2196/22460.",2021,,JMIR Research Protocols,10,1,e22460,33393927,,,#7720,Klemenc-Ketis 2021,,

Studies on box trainers have shown differing results concerning the benefit of 3D imaging. There are currently no studies analysing 3D imaging in virtual reality laparoscopy (VRL).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five surgical fellows, 10 surgical residents and 29 undergraduate medical students performed abstract and procedural tasks on a VRL simulator using conventional 2D and 3D imaging in a randomised order.RESULTS: No significant differences between the two imaging systems were shown for students or medical professionals. Participants who preferred three-dimensional imaging showed significantly better results in 2D as wells as in 3D imaging.DISCUSSION: First results on three-dimensional imaging on box trainers showed different results. Some studies resulted in an advantage of 3D imaging for laparoscopic novices. This study did not confirm the superiority of 3D imaging over conventional 2D imaging in a VRL simulator.CONCLUSION: In the present study on 3D imaging on a VRL simulator there was no significant advantage for 3D imaging compared to conventional 2D imaging.",2016,,Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie,141,3,297-301,23918724,,,#7733,Kneist 2016,,
Development of an objective assessment tool for total laparoscopic hysterectomy: A Delphi method among experts and evaluation on a virtual reality simulator,"Knight, S.; Aggarwal, R.; Agostini, A.; Loundou, A.; Berdah, S.; Crochet, P.","INTRODUCTION: Total Laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) requires an advanced level of operative skills and training. The aim of this study was to develop an objective scale specific for the assessment of technical skills for LH (H-OSATS) and to demonstrate feasibility of use and validity in a virtual reality setting.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The scale was developed using a hierarchical task analysis and a panel of international experts. A Delphi method obtained consensus among experts on relevant steps that should be included into the H-OSATS scale for assessment of operative performances. Feasibility of use and validity of the scale were evaluated by reviewing video recordings of LH performed on a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator. Three groups of operators of different levels of experience were assessed in a Marseille teaching hospital (10 novices, 8 intermediates and 8 experienced surgeons). Correlations with scores obtained using a recognised generic global rating tool (OSATS) were calculated.RESULTS: A total of 76 discrete steps were identified by the hierarchical task analysis. 14 experts completed the two rounds of the Delphi questionnaire. 64 steps reached consensus and were integrated in the scale. During the validation process, median time to rate each video recording was 25 minutes. There was a significant difference between the novice, intermediate and experienced group for total H-OSATS scores (133, 155.9 and 178.25 respectively; p = 0.002). H-OSATS scale demonstrated high inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.930; p<0.001) and test retest reliability (ICC = 0.877; p<0.001). High correlations were found between total H-OSATS scores and OSATS scores (rho = 0.928; p<0.001).CONCLUSION: The H-OSATS scale displayed evidence of validity for assessment of technical performances for LH performed on a virtual reality simulator. The implementation of this scale is expected to facilitate deliberate practice. Next steps should focus on evaluating the validity of the scale in the operating room.",2018,,PLoS ONE [Electronic Resource],13,1,e0190580,29293635,,,#7735,Knight 2018,,
An Epiduroscopy Simulator Based on a Serious Game for Spatial Cognitive Training (EpiduroSIM): User-Centered Design Approach,"Ko, J.; Lee, J. J.; Jang, S. W.; Yun, Y.; Kang, S.; Shin, D. A.; Kim, Y. S.","BACKGROUND: Performing high-level surgeries with endoscopy is challenging, and hence, an efficient surgical training method or system is required. Serious game-based simulators can provide a trainee-centered educational environment unlike traditional teacher-centered education environments since serious games provide a high level of interaction (feedback that induces learning).OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to propose an epiduroscopy simulator, EpiduroSIM, based on a serious game for spatial cognitive training.METHODS: EpiduroSIM was designed based on a serious game. For spatial cognitive training, the virtual environment of EpiduroSIM was modeled based on a cognitive map.RESULTS: EpiduroSIM was developed considering user accessibility to provide various functions. The experiment for the validation of EpiduroSIM focused on psychological fidelity and repetitive training effects. The experiments were conducted by dividing 16 specialists into 2 groups of 8 surgeons. The group was divided into beginner and expert based on their epiduroscopy experience. The psychological fidelity of EpiduroSIM was confirmed through the training results of the expert group rather than the beginner group. In addition, the repetitive training effect of EpiduroSIM was confirmed by improving the training results in the beginner group.CONCLUSIONS: EpiduroSIM may be useful for training beginner surgeons in epiduroscopy.",2019,,JMIR Serious Games,7,3,e12678,31456580,,,#7738,Ko 2019,,

Trainees were allowed to terminate training when they perceived competence in the procedure. Suturing skills were tested in the box trainer and scored using a modified Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills questionnaire by their own self-evaluation and two experienced gynaecological laparoscopists.RESULTS: Of the 36 participants recruited, 27 (75%) had no laparoscopic experience. Participants with no laparoscopic experience took longer to complete training than those with experience (median 90 minutes [interquartile range (IQR) 80-115] vs. 55 min [IQR 40-65], respectively; P = 0.044). There were no differences in successful completion of the task (7/12 [58.3%], 10/12 [83.3%], 7/12 [58.3%]; P = 0.325), median suturing time in seconds (628 [IQR 460-835], 611 [IQR 434-691], 609 [IQR 540-837]; P = 0.702), mean subjective (mean +/- SD 9.8 +/- 1.8, 10.4 +/- 2.8, 9.3 +/- 2.4; P = 0.710), and objective (7.2 +/- 1.8, 8.2 +/- 2.1, 7.6 +/- 1.7; P = 0.426) modified Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills score in the simulator, pelvic trainer, and control groups, respectively.

Medical Student Perception of a Virtual Reality Training Module for Anatomy Education,"Kolla, S.; Elgawly, M.; Gaughan, J. P.; Goldman, E.","Human anatomy education has been traditionally taught using methods such as lecture and cadaveric dissection. Modern technologies that enhance 3-dimensional (3D) visualization, such as virtual reality (VR), are currently being implemented as adjuncts. VR technology provides a level of 3D visualization and interactivity that allows users to explore structures in ways that are often unattainable by direct cadaveric dissection. For example, users can experience simulations in which they can teleport themselves to structures inside of a virtual human body, resize and observe objects from any visual perspective, and draw in a 3D space to test their understanding. In the following study, the utility of VR in anatomy education was assessed and compared with traditional teaching methods including lecture and cadaveric dissection. A VR platform was created in which first-year medical students identified anatomical structures on a virtual cadaveric specimen and then drew these structures on a virtual skeleton using a 3D drawing tool. After completing these tasks, subjects answered survey questions that assessed the usefulness of the virtual platform for learning the names and locations of anatomical structures and understanding 3D anatomical relationships. The survey was also used to evaluate the perceived educational value of VR relative to lectures and cadaveric dissection. The results of our study showed strong subject support for VR technology, suggesting VR is a helpful tool for learning human anatomy and a useful adjunct to lecture and cadaveric dissection.",2020,,Medical Science Educator,30,3,1201-1210,34457783,,,#7758,Kolla 2020,,

Validation of NOViSE,"Korzeniowski, P.; Brown, D. C.; Sodergren, M. H.; Barrow, A.; Bello, F.","The goal of this study was to establish face, content, and construct validity of NOViSE-the first force-feedback enabled virtual reality (VR) simulator for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Fourteen surgeons and surgical trainees performed 3 simulated hybrid transgastric cholecystectomies using a flexible endoscope on NOViSE. Four of them were classified as ""NOTES experts"" who had independently performed 10 or more simulated or human NOTES procedures. Seven participants were classified as ""Novices"" and 3 as ""Gastroenterologists"" with no or minimal NOTES experience. A standardized 5-point Likert-type scale questionnaire was administered to assess the face and content validity. NOViSE showed good overall face and content validity. In 14 out of 15 statements pertaining to face validity (graphical appearance, endoscope and tissue behavior, overall realism), >=50% of responses were ""agree"" or ""strongly agree."" In terms of content validity, 85.7% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that NOViSE is a useful training tool for NOTES and 71.4% that they would recommend it to others. Construct validity was established by comparing a number of performance metrics such as task completion times, path lengths, applied forces, and so on. NOViSE demonstrated early signs of construct validity. Experts were faster and used a shorter endoscopic path length than novices in all but one task. The results indicate that NOViSE authentically recreates a transgastric hybrid cholecystectomy and sets promising foundations for the further development of a VR training curriculum for NOTES without compromising patient safety or requiring expensive animal facilities.",2017,,Surgical Innovation,24,1,55-65,27671036,,,#7769,Korzeniowski 2017,,
Virtual Reality Simulator for Pediatric Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair,"Korzeniowski, P.; Chacon, C. S.; Russell, V. R.; Clarke, S. A.; Bello, F.","<b>Purpose:</b> Due to the small space environment, the learning curve of pediatric laparoscopic procedures is steep and requires excellent procedural skills. These are mainly gained through an apprenticeship on real patients. Computer-based virtual reality (VR) simulators offer a safe, cost-effective, and configurable training environment free from ethical and patient safety issues. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We have developed a prototype VR simulator for core manual skills training for pediatric laparoscopic hernia repair. The simulator currently consists of a hernia suturing task on a virtual nonanatomic trainer at a real pediatric scale. <b>Results:</b> A simulation realism validation study was carried out by obtaining subjective feedback (face and content validity) through a questionnaire from 36 pediatric surgeons. The overall simulation realism was on average marked 3.08 on a 5-point Likert scale (1: ""very unrealistic"" and 5: ""very realistic""). The participants were most satisfied with the visual realism (3.33) and most critical about the behavior of virtual tissue. The simulator showed good content validity; its usefulness as a training tool for hernia repair, suturing in general, and in learning fundamental laparoscopic skills was marked 3.61, 3.64, and 3.89, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> VR simulation of pediatric laparoscopic procedures can contribute to surgical training and improve the educational experience without putting our youngest patients at risk. This simulator is a first prototype, and the initial results indicate that it provides promising foundations for further development. More formal and larger studies such as construct validity and transfer of skills are envisaged as the prototype is developed further.",2021,,Journal of Laparoendoscopic & Advanced Surgical Techniques.

A.; Kenngott, H. G.; Fischer, L.; Muller-Stich, B. P.; Nickel, F.","BACKGROUND: There are no standards for optimal utilization of workplaces in laparoscopic training. This study aimed to define whether laparoscopy training should be done alone or in pairs (known as dyad training).METHODS: This was a three-arm randomized controlled trial with laparoscopically naive medical students (n = 100). Intervention groups participated alone (n = 40) or as dyad (n = 40) in a multimodality training curriculum with e-learning, basic, and procedural skills training using box and VR trainers. The control group (n = 20) had no training. Post-performance of a cadaveric porcine laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) was measured as the primary outcome by blinded raters using the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS). Global operative assessment of laparoscopic skills (GOALS), time for LC, and VR performances were secondary outcomes.RESULTS: There were no differences between groups for performance scores [OSATS: alone (40.2 +/- 9.8) vs. dyad (39.8 +/- 8.6), p = 0.995; alone vs. control (37.1 +/- 7.4), p = 0.548; or dyad vs. control, p = 0.590; and GOALS score: alone (10.6 +/- 3.0) vs. dyad (10.0 +/- 2.7), p = 0.599; alone vs. control (10.1 +/- 3.0), p = 0.748; or dyad vs. control, p = 0.998]. Dyad finished LC faster than control [median = 62.5 min (CI 58.0-73.0) vs. 76.5 min (CI 72.0-80+); p = 0.042], while there were no inter-group differences between alone vs. control [median = 69.0 min (CI 62.0-76.0) vs. control; p = 0.099] or alone vs. dyad (p = 0.840). Dyad and alone showed superior performance on the VR trainer vs. control for time, number of movements, and path length, but not for complications and application of cautery.CONCLUSIONS: The curriculum provided trainees with the laparoscopic skills needed to perform LC safely, irrespective of the number of trainees per workplace. Dyad training reduced the operation time needed for LC. Therefore, dyad training seems to be a promising alternative, especially if training time is limited and resources must be used as efficiently as possible.

"The Comparative Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Versus E-Module on the Training of Donning and Doffing Personal Protective Equipment: A Randomized, Simulation-Based Educational Study","Kravitz, M. B.; Dadario, N. B.; Arif, A.; Bellido, S.; Arif, A.; Ahmed, O.; Gibber, M.; Jafri, F. N.","Introduction Preventing errors in donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical for limiting the spread of infectious diseases. Virtual reality (VR) has demonstrated itself as an effective tool for asynchronous learning, but its use in PPE training has not been tested. The objective of this study was to compare donning and doffing performance between VR and e-module PPE training. Methods A prospective randomized open-blinded controlled trial was conducted to determine differences in donning and doffing performance after VR and e-module PPE training among medical staff and medical students at a single institution. The primary outcome was donning and doffing performance with real PPE, assessed using a 64-point checklist. The secondary outcome was participant preparedness and confidence level after training. Results Fifty-four participants were randomized, mostly consisting of medical students (n=24 {44%}) or emergency medicine and otolaryngology residents (n=19 {35%}). The VR group (n=27 {50%}) performed better than the control in the overall PPE scores but this was not statistically significant (mean {SD}, VR: 55.4 {4.4} vs e-module: 53.3 {8.1}; p = 0.40). VR participants also reported higher levels of preparedness and confidence after training. Residents as a subgroup achieved the highest increases after VR training compared to their counterparts in the control training group (mean {SD}, VR: 55.6 {4.9} vs e-module 48.4 {5.5}, p = 0.009). Conclusion In this randomized trial, VR training was found to be non-inferior to e-module for asynchronous PPE training. Our results suggest that in particular residents may benefit most from VR PPE training. Additionally, VR participants felt more confident and prepared to don and doff PPE after training compared to e-module participants. These findings are particularly relevant given the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Multidimensional Evaluation of Virtual Reality Paradigms in Clinical Neuropsychology: Application of the VR-Check Framework,"Krohn, S.; Tromp, J.; Quinque, E. M.; Belger, J.; Klotzsche, F.; Rekers, S.; Chojecki, P.; de Mooij, J.; Akbal, M.; McCall, C.; Villringer, A.; Gaebler, M.; Finke, C.; Thone-Otto, A.","Virtual reality (VR) represents a key technology of the 21st century, attracting substantial interest from a wide range of scientific disciplines. With regard to clinical neuropsychology, a multitude of new VR applications are being developed to overcome the limitations of classical paradigms. Consequently, researchers increasingly face the challenge of systematically evaluating the characteristics and quality of VR applications to design the optimal paradigm for their specific research question and study population. However, the multifaceted character of contemporary VR is not adequately captured by the traditional quality criteria (ie, objectivity, reliability, validity), highlighting the need for an extended paradigm evaluation framework. To address this gap, we propose a multidimensional evaluation framework for VR applications in clinical neuropsychology, summarized as an easy-to-use checklist (VR-Check). This framework rests on 10 main evaluation dimensions encompassing cognitive domain specificity, ecological relevance, technical feasibility, user feasibility, user motivation, task adaptability, performance quantification, immersive capacities, training feasibility, and predictable pitfalls. We show how VR-Check enables systematic and comparative paradigm optimization by illustrating its application in an exemplary research project on the assessment of spatial cognition and executive functions with immersive VR. This application furthermore demonstrates how the framework allows researchers to identify across-domain trade-offs, makes deliberate design decisions explicit, and optimizes the allocation of study resources. Complementing recent approaches to standardize clinical VR studies, the VR-Check framework enables systematic and project-specific paradigm optimization for behavioral and cognitive research in neuropsychology.",2020,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,22,4,e16724,32338614,,,#7802,Krohn 2020,,
Assessing the efficacy of tablet-based simulations for learning pseudo-surgical instrumentation,"Kryklywy, J. H.; Roach, V. A.; Todd, R. M.","Nurses and surgeons must identify and handle specialized instruments with high temporal and spatial precision. It is crucial that they are trained effectively. Traditional training methods include supervised practices and text-based study, which may expose patients to undue risk during practice procedures and lack motor/haptic training respectively. Tablet-based simulations have been proposed to mediate some of these limitations. We implemented a learning task that simulates surgical instrumentation nomenclature encountered by novice perioperative nurses. Learning was assessed following training in three distinct conditions: tablet-based simulations, text-based study, and real-world practice. Immediately following a 30-minute training period, instrument identification was performed with comparable accuracy and response times following tablet-based versus text-based training, with both being inferior to real-world practice. Following a week without practice, response times were equivalent between real-world and tablet-based practice. While tablet-based training does not achieve equivalent results in instrument identification accuracy as real-world practice, more practice repetitions in simulated environments may help reduce performance decline.

Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) and robotics are being increasingly used in different clinical contexts and require supporting education and training, which must begin within the medical school. There is currently a large discrepancy between the high demand and the number of scientifically proven concepts. The aim of this thesis was the conceptual design and structured evaluation of a newly developed learning/teaching concept for the digital transformation of medicine, with a special focus on the influence of surgical teaching.METHODS: Thirty-five students participated in three courses of the blended learning curriculum ""Medicine in the digital age"". The 4th module of this course deals with virtual reality, augmented reality and robotics in surgery. It is divided into the following course parts: (1) immersive surgery simulation of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, (2) liver surgery planning using AR/VR, (3) basic skills on the VR simulator for robotic surgery, (4) collaborative surgery planning in virtual space and (5) expert discussion. After completing the overall curriculum, a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the course concept was carried out by means of semi-structured interviews and standardised pre-/post-evaluation questionnaires.RESULTS: In the qualitative evaluation procedure of the interviews, 79 text statements were assigned to four main categories. The largest share (35%) was taken up by statements on the ""expert discussion"", which the students consider to be an elementary part of the course concept. In addition, the students perceived the course as a horizon-widening ""learning experience"" (29% of the statements) with high ""practical relevance"" (27%). The quantitative student evaluation shows a positive development in the three sub-competences knowledge, skills and attitude.CONCLUSION: Surgical teaching can be profitably used to develop digital skills. The speed of the change process of digital transformation in the surgical specialty must be considered.

A Novel Three-Dimensional Interactive Virtual Face to Facilitate Facial Anatomy Teaching Using Microsoft HoloLens,"Kumar, N.; Pandey, S.; Rahman, E.","BACKGROUND: In-depth understanding of facial anatomy is the foundation of clinical education and practices. Lately, anatomy education has undergone many changes due to the adoption of integrated medical curriculums. The time allocated to anatomy teaching on occasion been shortened to allow more time for clinical education. Innovation in visual technology such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) has added a new dimension to anatomy education. The authors present a mixed reality virtual face model to facilitate complex anatomy teaching using Microsoft HoloLens in various educational settings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Close-range photogrammetry technique was utilised to construct a virtual face using a dissected fresh-frozen cephalus. Scanning was undertaken using DSLR cameras, capable of capturing ten frames per second, in ten different angles on the dissected side and four for the undissected side. The images of the entire cephalous were also separately captured in twenty different angles. These images were processed using software to reconstruct the three-dimensional virtual face.RESULT: The virtual face using a mixed reality platform was able to demonstrate individual layers of the face and relevant clinically significant structures clearly with interactive labelling. Face and the content validity by 12 experts (plastic surgeons and dermatologists) demonstrated strong inter-rater reliability expressed as interclass correlation coefficient.CONCLUSION: An immersive experience by using Microsoft HoloLens provides an accurate 3D perception of the face to enhance anatomy learning. This can be utilised in undergraduate, postgraduate and continued medical education as an additional teaching tool in the constraints of cadaveric dissection.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE V: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

No commercial simulation module exists to teach this procedure. A specialist surgeon authored the module, including force-feedback interactive simulation, and designed a quiz to test knowledge of the key procedural steps. Five practicing surgeons, with 15 to 24 years of experience, peer reviewed and tested the module. In all, 14 residents and 9 fellows trained with the module and answered the quiz, preuse and postuse. Participants received an overview during Surgical Grand Rounds session and a 20-minute one-on-one tutorial followed by 30 minutes of instruction in addition to a force-feedback interactive simulation session. Additionally, in answering questionnaires, the trainees reflected on their learning experience and their experience with the TIPS framework.RESULTS: Correct quiz response rates on procedural steps improved significantly postuse over preuse. In the questionnaire, 96% of the respondents stated that the TIPS module prepares them well or very well for the adrenalectomy, and 87% indicated that the module successfully teaches the steps of the procedure.

Each student completed a pre-intervention and post-intervention test, consisting of 15 multiple-choice questions. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, Kolb Learning Style Inventory distribution, and the PSVT-R (P > 0.05). The post-test scores were significantly higher compared to pre-test scores in both the VR group (P < 0.001) and the control group (P < 0.001). The difference between the pre-test and post-test results was found to be significantly higher in favor of the VR group (P < 0.001). In this study, anatomy training with a 3D immersive VR system was found to be beneficial. These results suggest that VR systems can be used as an alternative method to the conventional anatomy training approach for health students.",2020,,Anatomical sciences education,13,5,648-656,32163659,,,#7823,Kurul 2020,,
Virtual Anatomical and Endoscopic Exploration Method of Internal Human Body for Training Simulator,"Kwon, K.; Park, J. S.; Shin, B. S.","BACKGROUND: Virtual environments have brought the use of realistic training closer to many different fields of education. In medical education, several visualization methods for studying inside the human body have been introduced as a way to verify the structure of internal organs. However, these methods are insufficient for realistic training simulators because they do not provide photorealistic scenes or offer an intuitive perception to the user. In addition, they are used in limited environments within a classroom setting.METHODS: We have developed a virtual dissection exploration system that provides realistic three-dimensional images and a virtual endoscopic experience. This system enables the user to manipulate a virtual camera through a human organ, using gesture-sensing technology. We can make a virtual dissection image of the human body using a virtual dissection simulator and then navigate inside an organ using a virtual endoscope. To improve the navigation performance during virtual endoscopy, our system warns the user about any potential collisions that may occur against the organ's wall by taking the virtual control sphere at the virtual camera position into consideration.RESULTS: Experimental results show that our system efficiently provides high-quality anatomical visualization. We can simulate anatomic training using virtual dissection and endoscopic images.CONCLUSION: Our training simulator would be helpful in training medical students because it provides an immersive environment.",2020,,Journal of Korean medical science,35,12,e90,32233159,,,#7827,Kwon 2020,,
The Use of Virtual Reality in Podiatric Medical Education,"Labovitz, J.; Hubbard, C.","Virtual reality in medical education is a recent development that significantly improves surgical skills, which translates to improved outcomes in the operating room (OR). The development of the Western University of Health Sciences virtual OR provides podiatric medical students basic OR knowledge and skills through performing basic surgical procedures. This new method of presenting content in podiatric medical education enhances the learning experience in a less stressful environment. The virtual reality experience allows students to gain experience without undue risk to the patient.

Virtual reality-based assessment of basic laparoscopic skills using the Leap Motion controller,"Lahanas, V.; Loukas, C.; Georgiou, K.; Lababidi, H.; Al-Jaroudi, D.","BACKGROUND: The majority of the current surgical simulators employ specialized sensory equipment for instrument tracking. The Leap Motion controller is a new device able to track linear objects with sub-millimeter accuracy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a virtual reality (VR) simulator for assessment of basic laparoscopic skills, based on the low-cost Leap Motion controller.METHODS: A simple interface was constructed to simulate the insertion point of the instruments into the abdominal cavity. The controller provided information about the position and orientation of the instruments. Custom tools were constructed to simulate the laparoscopic setup. Three basic VR tasks were developed: camera navigation (CN), instrument navigation (IN), and bimanual operation (BO). The experiments were carried out in two simulation centers: MPLSC (Athens, Greece) and CRESENT (Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). Two groups of surgeons (28 experts and 21 novices) participated in the study by performing the VR tasks. Skills assessment metrics included time, pathlength, and two task-specific errors. The face validity of the training scenarios was also investigated via a questionnaire completed by the participants.RESULTS: Expert surgeons significantly outperformed novices in all assessment metrics for IN and BO (p < 0.05). For CN, a significant difference was found in one error metric (p < 0.05). The greatest difference between the performances of the two groups occurred for BO. Qualitative analysis of the instrument trajectory revealed that experts performed more delicate movements compared to novices. Subjects' ratings on the feedback questionnaire highlighted the training value of the system.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence regarding the potential use of the Leap Motion controller for assessment of basic laparoscopic skills. The proposed system allowed the evaluation of dexterity of the hand movements. Future work will involve comparison studies with validated simulators and development of advanced training scenarios on current Leap Motion controller.",2017,,Surgical Endoscopy,31,12,5012-5023,28466361,,,#7838,Lahanas 2017,,

Learning With Virtual Reality in Nursing Education: Qualitative Interview Study Among Nursing Students Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model,"Lange, A. K.; Koch, J.; Beck, A.; Neugebauer, T.; Watzema, F.; Wrona, K. J.; Dockweiler, C.","BACKGROUND: Digital games-based learning is a method of using digital games to impart knowledge. Virtual reality (VR) programs are a practical application of this method. Due to demographic changes, the nursing profession will become increasingly important. These VR applications can be of use in training nurses for future professional challenges they may encounter. The continuous development of VR applications enables trainees to encounter simulated real life effectively and to experience increasingly concrete situations. This can be of great importance in nursing education, since 3-dimensionality enables a better visualization of many fields of activity and can prevent potential future errors. In addition to this learning effect, VR applications also bring an element of fun to learning.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this qualitative research effort is to observe the degree of acceptance of VR applications by nursing students in Germany. Various factors, including social influences, performance expectations, and effort expectations, are taken into consideration.METHODS: With a qualitative cohort study, the acceptance of nursing students towards VR applications in anatomy teaching was determined. The 12 participants were first asked to fill out a quantitative questionnaire on their sociodemographic characteristics and the extent to which they valued and liked using technology. The participants were then allowed to test the VR application themselves and were finally asked about their experience in a qualitative interview. For the collection of data and the analysis of results, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology was used in this study.RESULTS: Overall, the study shows that the interviewed persons rated the VR application quite positively. The greatest influence in this was the personal attitude towards technology; the higher this affinity is, the more useful the VR application appears. Social influences can also increase the participant's own acceptance if peers have a positive attitude towards such applications. The study shows that the trainees' motivation to learn was increased by using VR. We believe this is because each trainee could learn individually and the VR application was perceived as an enjoyable activity. Nevertheless, the cost factor of implementing VR applications in nursing training is currently still an obstacle, as not every institution has such financial capacities.CONCLUSIONS: The extent to which the use of VR applications in the training of nursing staff is justified depends on the degree of personal acceptance. The collected results give good practice-oriented insight into the attitude of trainees towards VR. Many of the interviewed persons saw benefits in the use of VR technologies. As VR applications are constantly developing, it is necessary to conduct further studies on VR applications in nursing education and to include other possible disciplines in which these applications can be helpful.",2020,,JMIR Nursing,3,1,e20249,34345791,,,#7853,Lange 2020,,

Clinical Value of Virtual Reality versus 3D Printing in Congenital Heart Disease,"Lau, I.; Gupta, A.; Sun, Z.","Both three-dimensional (3D) printing and virtual reality (VR) are reported as being superior to the current visualization techniques in conveying more comprehensive visualization of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, little is known in terms of their clinical value in diagnostic assessment, medical education, and preoperative planning of CHD. This cross-sectional study aims to address these by involving 35 medical practitioners to subjectively evaluate VR visualization of four selected CHD cases in comparison with the corresponding 3D printed heart models (3DPHM). Six questionnaires were excluded due to incomplete sections, hence a total of 29 records were included for the analysis. The results showed both VR and 3D printed heart models were comparable in terms of the degree of realism. VR was perceived as more useful in medical education and preoperative planning compared to 3D printed heart models, although there was no significant difference in the ratings (p = 0.54 and 0.35, respectively). Twenty-one participants (72%) indicated both the VR and 3DPHM provided additional benefits compared to the conventional medical imaging visualizations. This study concludes the similar clinical value of both VR and 3DPHM in CHD, although further research is needed to involve more cardiac specialists for their views on the usefulness of these tools.",2021,,Biomolecules,11,6,14,34198642,,,#7861,Lau 2021,,

Surgical technique and finesse in delicate procedures have become ever more important, and the onus is on plastic surgeons and plastic surgery residents to meet these needs to provide the best outcomes possible to patients. The ability to learn, simulate, and practice operating in a fashion that poses no harm to any patient is truly a gift from technology to surgery that any surgeon could benefit from, whether trainee or attending. This application of technology and simulation has been demonstrated in other fields such as in the airline industry with flight simulation. The ability to learn, synthesize, and incorporate learned materials and ideas through virtual, augmented, and mixed reality tools offers a great opportunity to put our field at the forefront of a paradigm shift in surgical education.

This simulator was coded in C++ using PhysX and FleX with a novel cutting algorithm and used a patient data-derived model and two instruments functioning as ultrasonic shears. The simulator was evaluated by nine expert surgeons and nine surgical novices. Each participant performed a simulated metastasectomy after training. Kinematic data were collected for the instrument position. Each participant completed a survey. The expert participants had a mean age of 47 years and 9/9 were certified in surgery. Novices had a mean age of 30 years and 0/9 were certified surgeons. The mean path length (novice 0.76 +/- 0.20 m vs. expert 0.46 +/- 0.16 m, p = 0.008), movements (138 +/- 45 vs. 84 +/- 32, p = 0.043) and time (174 +/- 44 s vs. 102 +/- 42 s, p = 0.004) were significantly different for the two participant groups.

Robot assisted versus laparoscopic suturing learning curve in a simulated setting,"Leijte, E.; de Blaauw, I.; Van Workum, F.; Rosman, C.; Botden, S.","BACKGROUND: Compared to conventional laparoscopy, robot assisted surgery is expected to have most potential in difficult areas and demanding technical skills like minimally invasive suturing. This study was performed to identify the differences in the learning curves of laparoscopic versus robot assisted suturing.METHOD: Novice participants performed three suturing tasks on the EoSim laparoscopic augmented reality simulator or the RobotiX robot assisted virtual reality simulator. Each participant performed an intracorporeal suturing task, a tilted plane needle transfer task and an anastomosis needle transfer task. To complete the learning curve, all tasks were repeated up to twenty repetitions or until a time plateau was reached. Clinically relevant and comparable parameters regarding time, movements and safety were recorded. Intracorporeal suturing time and cumulative sum analysis was used to compare the learning curves and phases.RESULTS: Seventeen participants completed the learning curve laparoscopically and 30 robot assisted. Median first knot suturing time was 611 s (s) for laparoscopic versus 251 s for robot assisted (p < 0.001), and this was 324 s versus 165 (sixth knot, p < 0.001) and 257 s and 149 s (eleventh knot, p < 0.001) respectively on base of the found learning phases. The percentage of 'adequate surgical knots' was higher in the laparoscopic than in the robot assisted group. First knot: 71% versus 60%, sixth knot: 100% versus 83%, and eleventh knot: 100% versus 73%. When assessing the 'instrument out of view' parameter, the robot assisted group scored a median of 0% after repetition four. In the laparoscopic group, the instrument out of view increased from 3.1 to 3.9% (left) and from 3.0 to 4.1% (right) between the first and eleventh knot (p > 0.05).CONCLUSION: The learning curve of minimally invasive suturing shows a shorter task time curve using robotic assistance compared to the laparoscopic curve.

"VERT, a virtual clinical environment, enhances understanding of radiation therapy planning concepts","Leong, A.; Herst, P.; Kane, P.","INTRODUCTION: The ability to understand treatment plan dosimetry and apply this understanding clinically is fundamental to the role of the radiation therapist. This study evaluates whether or not the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training (VERT) contributes to teaching treatment planning concepts to a cohort of first-year radiation therapy students.METHODS: We directly compared a custom-developed VERT teaching module with a standard teaching module with respect to the understanding of treatment planning concepts using a cross-over design. Students self-reported their understanding of specific concepts before and after delivery of the VERT and standard teaching modules and evaluated aspects of VERT as a learning experience. In addition, teaching staff participated in a semi-structured interview discussing the modules from an educational perspective.RESULTS: Both the standard teaching module and VERT teaching module enhanced conceptual understanding and level of confidence in the student cohort after both teaching periods. The proportion of students reporting a perceived increase in knowledge/confidence was similar for the VERT teaching module for all but two scenarios. We propose that an integrated approach, providing a strong theoretical conceptual framework, followed by VERT to situate this framework in the (simulated) clinical environment combines the best of both teaching approaches.CONCLUSION: This study has established for the first time a clear role for a tailored VERT teaching module in teaching RT planning concepts because of its ability to visualise conceptual information within a simulated clinical environment.",2018,,Journal of Medical Radiation Sciences,65,2,97-105,29516649,,,#7929,Leong 2018,,
An Immersive Multi-User Virtual Reality for Emergency Simulation Training: Usability Study,"Lerner, D.; Mohr, S.; Schild, J.; Goring, M.; Luiz, T.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as simulation technology in emergency medicine education and training, in particular for training nontechnical skills. Experimental studies comparing teaching and learning in VR with traditional training media often demonstrate the equivalence or even superiority regarding particular variables of learning or training effectiveness.OBJECTIVE: In the EPICSAVE (Enhanced Paramedic Vocational Training with Serious Games and Virtual Environments) project, a highly immersive room-scaled multi-user 3-dimensional VR simulation environment was developed. In this feasibility study, we wanted to gain initial insights into the training effectiveness and media use factors influencing learning and training in VR.METHODS: The virtual emergency scenario was anaphylaxis grade III with shock, swelling of the upper and lower respiratory tract, as well as skin symptoms in a 5-year-old girl (virtual patient) visiting an indoor family amusement park with her grandfather (virtual agent). A cross-sectional, one-group pretest and posttest design was used to evaluate the training effectiveness and quality of the training execution. The sample included 18 active emergency physicians.RESULTS: The 18 participants rated the VR simulation training positive in terms of training effectiveness and quality of the training execution. A strong, significant correlation (r=.53, P=.01) between experiencing presence and assessing training effectiveness was observed. Perceived limitations in usability and a relatively high extraneous cognitive load reduced this positive effect.CONCLUSIONS: The training within the virtual simulation environment was rated as an effective educational approach. Specific media use factors appear to modulate training effectiveness (ie, improvement through ""experience of presence"" or reduction through perceived limitations in usability).

Simulation-based dental education could serve as a powerful aid to preclinical instruction. This article provides an overview of how dental simulators can be used in dental instruction and manual dexterity training, utilizing the Simodont dental trainer as a reference. The Simodont dental trainer provides a platform for students to hone their manual dexterity skills and practice repeatedly prior to conventional clinical simulations. Additionally, it can reduce resource wastage. However, the financial cost of setting up and maintaining the system can be high. The high cost would ultimately limit the number of devices each individual school could afford, as a potential drawback to meeting the training needs of many dental students at one time. The machine's force-feedback mechanism provides trainees with the tactile experience of drilling into various tissues. Students are empowered via self-learning and assessment, with guidance provided for diagnosis and treatment.

Real-Time Needle Force Modeling for VR-Based Renal Biopsy Training with Respiratory Motion Using Direct Clinical Data,"Li, F.; Tai, Y.; Li, Q.; Peng, J.; Huang, X.; Chen, Z.; Shi, J.","Realistic tool-tissue interactive modeling has been recognized as an essential requirement in the training of virtual surgery. A virtual basic surgical training framework integrated with real-time force rendering has been recognized as one of the most immersive implementations in medical education. Yet, compared to the original intraoperative data, there has always been an argument that these data are represented by lower fidelity in virtual surgical training. In this paper, a dynamic biomechanics experimental framework is designed to achieve a highly immersive haptic sensation during the biopsy therapy with human respiratory motion; it is the first time to introduce the idea of periodic extension idea into the dynamic percutaneous force modeling. Clinical evaluation is conducted and performed in the Yunnan First People's Hospital, which not only demonstrated a higher fitting degree (AVG: 99.36%) with the intraoperation data than previous algorithms (AVG: 87.83%, 72.07%, and 66.70%) but also shows a universal fitting range with multilayer tissue. 27 urologists comprising 18 novices and 9 professors were invited to the VR-based training evaluation based on the proposed haptic rendering solution.

Design and Evaluation of Personalized Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Surgery Simulation System,"Li, S.; Cui, J.; Hao, A.; Zhang, S.; Zhao, Q.","In recent years, medical simulators have been widely applied to a broad range of surgery training tasks. However, most of the existing surgery simulators can only provide limited immersive environments with a few pre-processed organ models, while ignoring the instant modeling of various personalized clinical cases, which brings substantive differences between training experiences and real surgery situations. To this end, we present a virtual reality (VR) based surgery simulation system for personalized percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The simulation system can directly take patient-specific clinical data as input and generate virtual 3D intervention scenarios. Specially, we introduce a fiber-based patient-specific cardiac dynamic model to simulate the nonlinear deformation among the multiple layers of the cardiac structure, which can well respect and correlate the atriums, ventricles and vessels, and thus gives rise to more effective visualization and interaction. Meanwhile, we design a tracking and haptic feedback hardware, which can enable users to manipulate physical intervention instruments and interact with virtual scenarios. We conduct quantitative analysis on deformation precision and modeling efficiency, and evaluate the simulation system based on the user studies from 16 cardiologists and 20 intervention trainees, comparing it to traditional desktop intervention simulators. The results confirm that our simulation system can provide a better user experience, and is a suitable platform for PCI surgery training and rehearsal.",2021,,IEEE Transactions on Visualization & Computer Graphics,27,11,4150-4160,34449371,,,#7961,Li 2021,,

All three groups reported significant improvement in their levels of self-efficacy (P<.05) and attitudes (P<.001) toward interprofessional team care about 1 month after the interprofessional learning activity. Although no significant difference was found (P=.06) between the WI-VR-SE and WI-SE-VR groups in the self-efficacy posttests, participants in the SE-WI-VR group reported significantly lower (P<.05) posttest scores than those in the WI-SE-VR group. The majority of the participants (137/198, 69.1%) selected the instructional sequence ""WI-VR-SE"" as their top preference.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the instructional sequence of a blended learning approach can have a significant impact on students' learning outcomes. The learning of concepts from WI followed by problem-solving activity in the SE was found to be a more effective learning sequence than the reverse sequence. We recommend that future studies focus on scaffolding students' learning when planning instructional sequences for technologically enhanced learning activities within blended learning environments.",2019,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,21,5,e12537,31140432,,,#7990,Liaw 2019,,
Virtual education: Dental morphologies in a virtual teaching environment,"Liebermann, A.; Erdelt, K.","OBJECTIVES: Digital technology is already playing an increasingly important role in the education of students. The present investigation examined the acceptance of preclinical students for learning dental morphologies in virtual reality (VR).METHODS: The creation of the VR dental teaching environment was divided into 3 sections: (a) generation of the digital data; (b) creation of the VR dental learning environment for tooth morphologies; and (c) evaluation by preclinical students through questionnaires combined with visual analogue scale and fixed-answer options. Students of the Department of Prosthetic Dentistry of the University Hospital Munich were able to stay/interact in the VR dental learning environment for 10 minutes with VR headsets and hand controllers. The data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and exploratory data analysis using the median value and interquartile range.RESULTS: Of the students, 34.9% stated that they understand dental morphologies much better, 57.1% better, and 7.9% equally well compared to using the traditional textbook. The students would be willing to spend about 500 euros privately for the VR equipment. The haptic and auditive teaching elements were evaluated more positively than the purely visual ones of the integrated information boards.CONCLUSIONS: Learning in the VR dental learning environment showed a high level of acceptance among all students and should be integrated as a fixed element in the dental curriculum. A further development for use independent of time and place is desirable.",2020,,Journal of dental education,84,10,1143-1150,32511757,,,#7993,Liebermann 2020,,
Virtual dental teaching and its effect on test success - A cross-over study,"Liebermann, A.; Seefelder, J.; Nold, E.; Huth, K. C.; Erdelt, K.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this cross-over investigation was to analyze the effect of virtual teaching using virtual reality (VR) within a dental learning environment by preclinical students with or without dental professional experience on test performance.METHODS: Preclinical students (N = 82) were randomly divided into two groups for cross-over testing of tooth morphology knowledge: (a) anterior VR-group (group 1) using the VR-glasses as an additional learning tool for the anterior tooth morphologies and (b) posterior VR-group (group 2) using it for the posterior tooth morphologies also in addition to conventional learning. All students used the VR-glasses for 1 week independent of time and location depending on group. The students had to recognize teeth (anterior or posterior within two separate tests after three [anterior test] and 6 weeks [posterior test] of practical course) and note the tooth number and characteristics in written form. Former dental experience (dental technician/assistance) was noted. Test results were analyzed to quantify the effect of virtual teaching on test scores. Data were analyzed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Mann-Whitney U test (p = 0.05).RESULTS: By differentiating the two student groups (use of VR glasses for anterior/posterior teeth) within the dental experience group, significantly better test results (p = 0.040) were shown for group 1 in the total posterior teeth test score. Furthermore, no other significant differences, but a possible tendency, in the test results and thus no effect of the use of the VR glasses on both VR groups could be analyzed (p >= 0.051).CONCLUSIONS: Using the VR tooth learning environment predominantly did not lead to a significant improvement of test results. Anterior teeth test scores predominantly showed significantly better results than posterior teeth test scores.",2022,,Journal of dental education,86,5,622-629,34865226,,,#7994,Liebermann 2022,,
"Creating a new ""reality"" for medical education: the Nexus Reality Lab for virtual reality","Lilly, J.; Kaneshiro, K. N.; Misquith, C.; Dennett, B.","BACKGROUND: The Technology Team at the Ruth Lilly Medical Library, Indiana University (IU), first started exploring virtual reality (VR) in 2016. In 2017, we began offering weekly sessions dubbed VRidays (""VR Fridays"") to give students an opportunity to experience the technology. We also purchased a portable VR setup that allowed us to demonstrate VR at our regional campuses.DESCRIPTION: To lower the entry barrier to VR, the Technology Team collaborated with the IU Advanced Visualization Lab to establish a reality lab in our collaborative learning space. The lab opened in the fall of 2018 and consists of four high-end VR stations that are accessible to students at any time, but they can also make an appointment for a more guided experience.

Virtual reality training for cataract surgery operating performance in ophthalmology trainees,"Lin, J. C.; Yu, Z.; Scott, I. U.; Greenberg, P. B.","BACKGROUND: Cataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking.OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings.SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non-VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings.MAIN RESULTS: We included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta-analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low-certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. The evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR-trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] -17 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] -21.62 to -12.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low-certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14). One study reported that VR-trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD -8.31, 95% CI -22.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low-certainty evidence). For secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory and greater impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR-trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR-trained relative to wet laboratory-trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD -1.40 minutes, 95% CI -1.96 to -0.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR-trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR- and wet laboratory-trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR-trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR-trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory-trained trainees (MD -1.50, 95% CI -6.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low-certainty evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent.",2021,,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,12,,CD014953,34931701,,,#8016,Lin 2021,,
[Applying Virtual Reality Assisted Critical Thinking Training Programs Among Nurse Practitioners],"Lin, S. C.","The three-dimensional virtual world generated in virtual reality (VR) environments involves vision, hearing, touch, and potentially other user senses. VR environments are designed to closely simulate real situations/scenarios, allowing users to observe and engage in experiences free of time and space restrictions. Virtual patients are an extension of virtual reality. In recent years, virtual reality exercises have been widely used in various medical education and training programs to promote professional competence. The clinical practice of nurse practitioners is similar to physicians in some institutions. Nurse practitioners perform supplementary medical services such as physical assessment, medical history collection and consultation, problem detection, test result assessment, differential diagnosis, and patient health problem decision-making under the supervision of physicians. The critical thinking component in nurse practitioner education is largely similar to that taught in medical education. VR is often used in medical education to train medical students. Also, VR may be applied in critical thinking training for nurse practitioners to promote competence in reasoning and differential diagnosis. However, few studies in the literature have evaluated the effectiveness of VR-based training for nurse practitioners in Taiwan. In the future, this issue needs to be studied further.",2021,,Hu Li Tsa Chih - Journal of Nursing,68,5,18-23,34549404,,,#8020,Lin 2021,,
Evaluating Simulator-Based Teaching Methods for Endoscopic Sinus Surgery,"Lindquist, N. R.; Leach, M.; Simpson, M. C.; Antisdel, J. L.","A multitude of simulator systems for endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) are available as training tools for residents preparing to enter the operating room. These include human cadavers, virtual reality, realistic anatomic models, and low-fidelity gelatin molds. While these models have been validated and evaluated as independent tools for surgical trainees, no study has performed direct comparison of their outcomes. To address this deficiency, we aimed to evaluate the utility of high-fidelity and low-fidelity trainers as compared to a traditional control (no simulator exposure) for novice trainees acquiring basic ESS skills. Thirty-four first-year medical students were randomized to 3 groups and taught basic sinus anatomy and instrumentation. Two groups received training with either the high-fidelity or low-fidelity trainer, while 1 group served as control. These groups were then tested with cadaveric specimens. These sessions were recorded and graded by an expert. There was no statistical difference in performance between the 3 study groups with regard to identification of anatomy, endoscopic competency, or completion of basic tasks. When the high-fidelity and low-fidelity arms were grouped into a single ""trained"" cohort, they demonstrated significantly improved time to completion for basic anatomy (P = .043) and total time (P = .041). This is the first study to perform a direct comparison of performance between high-fidelity and low-fidelity ESS simulators and controls. Although we found no difference in performance of novice trainees with regard to basic anatomical identification or procedural tasks associated with ESS, the use of ESS simulators may improve time to completion.",2019,,"Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal",98,8,490-495,31018690,,,#8030,Lindquist 2019,,
Validation of the VBLaST pattern cutting task: a learning curve study,"Linsk, A. M.; Monden, K. R.; Sankaranarayanan, G.; Ahn, W.; Jones, D. B.; De, S.; Schwaitzberg, S. D.; Cao, C. G. L.","BACKGROUND: Mastery of laparoscopic skills is essential in surgical practice and requires considerable time and effort to achieve. The Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST-PC<sup>©</sup>) is a virtual simulator that was developed as a computerized version of the pattern cutting (PC) task in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) system. To establish convergent validity for the VBLaST-PC<sup>©</sup>, we assessed trainees' learning curves using the cumulative summation (CUSUM) method and compared them with those on the FLS.METHODS: Twenty-four medical students were randomly assigned to an FLS training group, a VBLaST training group, or a control group. Fifteen training sessions, 30 min in duration per session per day, were conducted over 3 weeks. All subjects completed pretest, posttest, and retention test (2 weeks after posttest) on both the FLS and VBLaST<sup>©</sup> simulators. Performance data, including time, error, FLS score, learning rate, learning plateau, and CUSUM score, were analyzed.RESULTS: The learning curve for all trained subjects demonstrated increasing performance and a performance plateau. CUSUM analyses showed that five of the seven subjects reached the intermediate proficiency level but none reached the expert proficiency level after 150 practice trials. Performance was significantly improved after simulation training, but only in the assigned simulator. No significant decay of skills after 2 weeks of disuse was observed. Control subjects did not show any learning on the FLS simulator, but improved continually in the VBLaST simulator.CONCLUSIONS: Although VBLaST<sup>©</sup>- and FLS-trained subjects demonstrated similar learning rates and plateaus, the majority of subjects required more than 150 trials to achieve proficiency. Trained subjects demonstrated improved performance in only the assigned simulator, indicating specificity of training. The virtual simulator may provide better opportunities for learning, especially with limited training exposure.",2018,,Surgical Endoscopy,32,4,1990-2002,29052071,,,#8033,Linsk 2018,,

They participated in the online virtual learning course independently on the Virtual Learning Network Platform (VLNP). One week later, the students were invited to complete their post-learning crown preparation with the RDTES. A questionnaire survey explored students' perceived benefits or drawbacks of the virtual educational system. Students were allocated into Group A (n = 15), B (n = 24) and C (n = 18) based on their pre-learning performance. Differences of assessment results amongst different groups were evaluated by ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests.

Anatomy-Specific Virtual Reality Simulation in Temporal Bone Dissection: Perceived Utility and Impact on Surgeon Confidence,"Locketz, G. D.; Lui, J. T.; Chan, S.; Salisbury, K.; Dort, J. C.; Youngblood, P.; Blevins, N. H.","Objective To evaluate the effect of anatomy-specific virtual reality (VR) surgical rehearsal on surgeon confidence and temporal bone dissection performance. Study Design Prospective pre- and poststudy of a novel virtual surgical rehearsal platform. Setting Academic otolaryngology-head and neck surgery residency training programs. Subjects and Methods Sixteen otolaryngology-head and neck surgery residents from 2 North American training institutions were recruited. Surveys were administered to assess subjects' baseline confidence in performing 12 subtasks of cortical mastoidectomy with facial recess. A cadaver temporal bone was randomly assigned to each subject. Cadaver specimens were scanned with a clinical computed tomography protocol, allowing the creation of anatomy-specific models for use in a VR surgical rehearsal platform. Subjects then rehearsed a virtual mastoidectomy on data sets derived from their specimens. Surgical confidence surveys were administered again. Subjects then dissected assigned cadaver specimens, which were blindly graded with a modified Welling scale. A final survey assessed the perceived utility of rehearsal on dissection performance. Results Of 16 subjects, 14 (87.5%) reported a significant increase in overall confidence after conducting an anatomy-specific VR rehearsal. A significant correlation existed between perceived utility of rehearsal and confidence improvement. The effect of rehearsal on confidence was dependent on trainee experience and the inherent difficulty of the surgical subtask. Postrehearsal confidence correlated strongly with graded dissection performance. Subjects rated anatomy-specific rehearsal as having a moderate to high contribution to their dissection performance. Conclusion Anatomy-specific virtual rehearsal improves surgeon confidence in performing mastoid dissection, dependent on surgeon experience and task difficulty. The subjective confidence gained through rehearsal correlates positively with subsequent objective dissection performance.",2017,,Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery,156,6,1142-1149,28322125,,,#8077,Locketz 2017,,
Fully Immersive Virtual Reality for Total Hip Arthroplasty: Objective Measurement of Skills and Transfer of Visuospatial Performance After a Competency-Based Simulation Curriculum,"Logishetty, K.; Gofton, W. T.; Rudran, B.; Beaule, P. E.; Cobb, J. P.","BACKGROUND: Fully immersive virtual reality (VR) uses headsets to situate a surgeon in a virtual operating room to perform open surgical procedures. The aims of this study were to determine (1) if a VR curriculum for training residents to perform anterior approach total hip replacement (AA-THR) was feasible, (2) if VR enabled residents' performance to be measured objectively, and (3) if cognitive and motor skills that were learned with use of VR were transferred to the physical world.METHODS: The performance of 32 orthopaedic residents (surgical postgraduate years [PGY]-1 through 4) with no prior experience with AA-THR was measured during 5 consecutive VR training and assessment sessions. Outcome measures were related to procedural sequence, efficiency of movement, duration of surgery, and visuospatial precision in acetabular component positioning and femoral neck osteotomy, and were compared with the performance of 4 expert hip surgeons to establish competency-based criteria. Pretraining and post-training assessments on dry bone models were used to assess the transfer of visuospatial skills from VR to the physical world.RESULTS: Residents progressively developed surgical skills in VR on a learning curve through repeated practice, plateauing, on average, after 4 sessions (4.1 +/- 0.6 hours); they reached expert VR levels for 9 of 10 metrics (except femoral osteotomy angle). Procedural errors were reduced by 79%, assistive prompts were reduced by 70%, and procedural duration was reduced by 28%. Dominant and nondominant hand movements were reduced by 35% and 36%, respectively, and head movement was reduced by 44%. Femoral osteotomy was performed more accurately, and acetabular implant orientation improved in VR assessments. In the physical world assessments, experts were more accurate than residents prior to simulation, but were matched by residents after simulation for all of the metrics except femoral osteotomy angle. The residents who performed best in VR were the most accurate in the physical world, while 2 residents were unable to achieve competence despite sustained practice.CONCLUSIONS: For novice surgeons learning AA-THR skills, fully immersive VR technology can objectively measure progress in the acquisition of surgical skills as measured by procedural sequence, efficiency of movement, and visuospatial accuracy.

Virtual reality training improves trainee performance in total hip arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial,"Logishetty, K.; Rudran, B.; Cobb, J. P.","AIMS: Arthroplasty skills need to be acquired safely during training, yet operative experience is increasingly hard to acquire by trainees. Virtual reality (VR) training using headsets and motion-tracked controllers can simulate complex open procedures in a fully immersive operating theatre. The present study aimed to determine if trainees trained using VR perform better than those using conventional preparation for performing total hip arthroplasty (THA).PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 24 surgical trainees (seven female, 17 male; mean age 29 years (28 to 31)) volunteered to participate in this observer-blinded 1:1 randomized controlled trial. They had no prior experience of anterior approach THA. Of these 24 trainees, 12 completed a six-week VR training programme in a simulation laboratory, while the other 12 received only conventional preparatory materials for learning THA. All trainees then performed a cadaveric THA, assessed independently by two hip surgeons. The primary outcome was technical and non-technical surgical performance measured by a THA-specific procedure-based assessment (PBA). Secondary outcomes were step completion measured by a task-specific checklist, error in acetabular component orientation, and procedure duration.RESULTS: VR-trained surgeons performed at a higher level than controls, with a median PBA of Level 3a (procedure performed with minimal guidance or intervention) versus Level 2a (guidance required for most/all of the procedure or part performed). VR-trained surgeons completed 33% more key steps than controls (mean 22 (sd 3) vs 12 (sd 3)), were 12degree more accurate in component orientation (mean error 4degree (sd 6degree) vs 16degree (sd 17degree)), and were 18% faster (mean 42 minutes (sd 7) vs 51 minutes (sd 9)).CONCLUSION: Procedural knowledge and psychomotor skills for THA learned in VR were transferred to cadaveric performance. Basic preparatory materials had limited value for trainees learning a new technique. VR training advanced trainees further up the learning curve, enabling highly precise component orientation and more efficient surgery. VR could augment traditional surgical training to improve how surgeons learn complex open procedures.

Virtual reality in spinal endoscopy: a paradigm shift in education to support spine surgeons,"Lohre, R.; Wang, J. C.; Lewandrowski, K. U.; Goel, D. P.","BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) and endoscopic spine surgery have continually evolving indications in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. Endoscopic spine surgery entails treatment of disc disease, stenosis, spondylolisthesis, radiculopathy, and deformity. MISS involves complex motor skills in regions of variable anatomy. Simulator use has been proposed to aid in training and skill retention, preoperative planning, and intraoperative use.METHODS: A systematic review of five databases was performed for publications pertaining to the use of virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed (MR) reality in MISS and spinal endoscopic surgery. Qualitative data analysis was undertaken with focus of study design, quality, and reported outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Quality Instrument (MERSQI) score and level of evidence (LoE) by a modified Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) level for simulation in medicine.RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies were retained for data collection. Studies were of intervention-control, clinical application, and pilot or cross-sectional design. Identified articles illustrated use of VR, AR, and MR in all study designs. Procedures included pedicle cannulation and screw insertion, vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED), lumbar puncture and facet injection, transvertebral anterior cervical foraminotomy (TVACF) and posterior cervical laminoforaminotomy. Overall MERSQI score was low-to-medium [M =9.71 (SD =2.60); range, 4.5-13.5], and LoE was predominantly low given the number of purely descriptive articles, or low-quality randomized studies.CONCLUSIONS: The current scope of VR, AR, and MR surgical simulators in MISS and spinal endoscopic surgery was described. Studies demonstrate improvement in technical skill and patient outcomes in short term follow-up. Despite this, overall study quality and levels of evidence remain low. Cohesive study design and reporting with focus on transfer validity in training scenarios, and patient derived outcome measures in clinical studies are required to further advance the field.",2020,,The Journal of Spine Surgery,6,Suppl 1,S208-S223,32195429,,,#8088,Lohre 2020,,

[Augmented Reality in Ophthalmology: Technical Innovation Complements Education for Medical Students],"Loidl, M.; Schneider, A.; Keis, O.; Ochsner, W.; Grab-Kroll, C.; Lang, G. K.; Kampmeier, J.","BACKGROUND: At the Medical Faculty of the University of Ulm, the learning objectives of ophthalmology are taught to students in a one-week block course in the fourth year of study. According to the National Competency-based Learning Objective Catalogue Medicine (NKLM), one of these learning objectives is the clinical examination of the eye, including the eye fundus examination. In order to best train this expertise as defined in the NKLM, a novel, augmented reality-based training simulator (Eyesi Indirect, VRmagic Holding AG, Mannheim, Germany) was integrated into the teaching at the University Eye Hospital Ulm. During the block week, two key questions were examined: Does the one week block lesson increase interest in ophthalmology? How do students assess the use of an innovative e-learning technology compared to three other classical teaching methods for learning ophthalmoscopy?MATERIAL/METHODS: As part of the student teaching (block weeks July and October 2016), 292 students were questioned by questionnaire anonymously and on a voluntary basis regarding their assessment of the block week and the training simulator at the beginning and end of the one week event. The ophthalmoscopies were classically practiced on the ophthalmoscope trainer, head model and on fellow students and then performed on the new training simulator.RESULTS: Overall, there was little interest among the students in ophthalmology. However, the block week helped to increase interest (p < 0.001). The assessments of attractiveness before and after the block week of ophthalmology as a later professional goal and as an optional subject in the practical year were also significantly increased (p < 0.001 or p = 0.031). With regard to the use of e-learning technologies, it was shown that the handling of the simulator for learning ophthalmoscopy was rated more attractive by the students than the classical technology-based teaching methods (all p < 0.01). The joy of learning could only be further increased by practicing on a fellow student (p = 0.051).CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show a positive impact of the block week on the attractiveness assessment of the specialty by the participating students.

[A new age of mass casuality education? : The InSitu project: realistic training in virtual reality environments],"Lorenz, D.; Armbruster, W.; Vogelgesang, C.; Hoffmann, H.; Pattar, A.; Schmidt, D.; Volk, T.; Kubulus, D.","BACKGROUND: Chief emergency physicians are regarded as an important element in the care of the injured and sick following mass casualty accidents. Their education is very theoretical; practical content in contrast often falls short. Limitations are usually the very high costs of realistic (large-scale) exercises, poor reproducibility of the scenarios, and poor corresponding results.OBJECTIVES: To substantially improve the educational level because of the complexity of mass casualty accidents, modified training concepts are required that teach the not only the theoretical but above all the practical skills considerably more intensively than at present. Modern training concepts should make it possible for the learner to realistically simulate decision processes. This article examines how interactive virtual environments are applicable for the education of emergency personnel and how they could be designed.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Virtual simulation and training environments offer the possibility of simulating complex situations in an adequately realistic manner. The so-called virtual reality (VR) used in this context is an interface technology that enables free interaction in addition to a stereoscopic and spatial representation of virtual large-scale emergencies in a virtual environment. Variables in scenarios such as the weather, the number wounded, and the availability of resources, can be changed at any time. The trainees are able to practice the procedures in many virtual accident scenes and act them out repeatedly, thereby testing the different variants.RESULTS: With the aid of the ""InSitu"" project, it is possible to train in a virtual reality with realistically reproduced accident situations. These integrated, interactive training environments can depict very complex situations on a scale of 1:1. Because of the highly developed interactivity, the trainees can feel as if they are a direct part of the accident scene and therefore identify much more with the virtual world than is possible with desktop systems.CONCLUSION: Interactive, identifiable, and realistic training environments based on projector systems could in future enable a repetitive exercise with changes within a decision tree, in reproducibility, and within different occupational groups. With a hard- and software environment numerous accident situations can be depicted and practiced. The main expense is the creation of the virtual accident scenes. As the appropriate city models and other three-dimensional geographical data are already available, this expenditure is very low compared with the planning costs of a large-scale exercise.",2016,,Anaesthesist,65,9,703-9,27411523,,,#8099,Lorenz 2016,,
Medical Student Education for Abdominal Radiographs in a 3D Virtual Classroom Versus Traditional Classroom: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Lorenzo-Alvarez, R.; Rudolphi-Solero, T.; Ruiz-Gomez, M. J.; Sendra-Portero, F.","<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this article is to compare the effectiveness of practical radiology learning by medical students in a 3D virtual world versus the real world. <b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS.</b> Two hundred fifteen 3rd-year medical students were randomized into two groups to attend the same workshop on abdominal radiography interpretation in a virtual world classroom (VW group) and in real life (RL group). Pre- and post-training knowledge tests consisting of 12 multiple choice questions were performed at the beginning of the workshop and 2 months later. <b>RESULTS.</b> Fifty-four of 107 and five of 108 students refused to attend their respective group, resulting in the participation of 53 students (VW group) and 103 students (RL group) in this study. No significant differences were found between groups in the tests taken before (VW group, mean [+/- SD], 4.5 +/- 1.8 points; RL group, 4.0 +/- 1.3 points) and after (VW group, 6.2 +/- 1.2; RL group, 6.0 +/- 1.7 points) training. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Radiology education in a 3D virtual classroom fosters participatory learning and results in similar acquisition of interpretive skills as a traditional face-to-face classroom. Virtual worlds allow the performance of online activities to learn interpretive skills with guaranteed success in learning similar to that of conventional activities. Additionally, the relative lack of identity in the virtual workshops makes students less afraid to speak and more participatory.",2019,,AJR.

Virtual Reality Biofeedback in Health: A Scoping Review,"Luddecke, R.; Felnhofer, A.","Over the past decades, virtual reality (VR) has found its way into biofeedback (BF) therapy programs. Using VR promises to overcome challenges encountered in traditional BF such as low treatment motivation, low attentional focus and the difficulty of transferring learnt abilities to everyday life. Yet, a comprehensive research synthesis is still missing. Hence, this scoping review aims to provide an overview over empirical studies on VR based BF regarding key outcomes, included samples, used soft- and hardware, BF parameters, mode of application and potential limitations. We systematically searched Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL, Google Scholar and Open Grey for empirical research. Eighteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Samples mostly consisted of healthy (44.4%) and/or adult (77.7%) participants. Outcomes were mainly anxiety (44.4%), stress (44.4%) or pain reduction (11.1%), which were reduced by the VR-BF interventions at least as much as by classical BF. Participants in VR-BF interventions showed higher motivation and involvement as well as a better user experience. Heart rate or heart rate variability were the most frequently used BF parameters (50.0%), and most VR-BF interventions (72.2%) employed a natural environment (e.g., island). Currently, there is no clear evidence that VR-BF is more effective than traditional BF. Yet, results indicate that VR-BF may have advantages regarding motivation, user experience, involvement and attentional focus. Further research is needed to assess the specific impact of VR and gamification. Also, testing a broader range of clinical and younger samples would allow more far-reaching conclusions.",2022,,Applied Psychophysiology & Biofeedback,47,1,15-Jan,34860290,,,#8121,Luddecke 2022,,
Design of a Virtual Reality Interactive Training System for Public Health Emergency Preparedness for Major Emerging Infectious Diseases: Theory and Framework,"Luo, Y.; Li, M.; Tang, J.; Ren, J.; Zheng, Y.; Yu, X.; Jiang, L.; Fan, D.; Chen, Y.","BACKGROUND: Sufficient public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is the key factor in effectively responding to and recovering from major emerging infectious diseases (MEIDs). However, in the face of MEIDs, PHEP is insufficient, so it is necessary to improve PHEP. The rapid development of virtual reality and human-computer interaction provides unprecedented opportunities for innovative educational methods.OBJECTIVE: This study designed a virtual reality interactive training system (VRITS) to provide an effective path for improving PHEP in the context of MEIDs so that the public can effectively respond to and recover from MEIDs.METHODS: This study used interactive narrative, situated learning and human-computer interaction theories as a theoretical framework to guide the design of the system. We used the literature research method and the Delphi method; consulted multidisciplinary experts, such as infectious diseases, disease control, psychology, and public health personnel, to determine the educational content framework; and set up an interdisciplinary team to construct an operating system framework for the VRITS.RESULTS: We named the VRITS ""People's War Against Pandemic."" The educational content framework includes 20 knowledge, emotion, and behavior skills in 5 aspects (cooperating with prevention and control work, improving emergency response ability, guaranteeing supplies and equipment, preparing economic resources, and maintaining physical and mental health). The operating system framework includes virtual interactive training, knowledge corner, intelligent evaluation, and community forum modules, and the core module is the virtual interactive training module. In this module, users control virtual characters to move in various scenes, and then identify and analyze the controllability and harmfulness of the evolving pandemic and select the correct prevention and control strategy to avoid infecting themselves and others.CONCLUSIONS: The development and sharing of the multidisciplinary theoretical framework adopted by People's War Against Pandemic can help us clarify the design ideas and assumptions of the VRITS; predict training results; understand the ability of training to change emergency knowledge, emergency emotion, and behavioral responses to MEIDs; and promote the development of more effective training systems based on virtual reality.",2021,,JMIR Serious Games,9,4,e29956,34904951,,,#8129,Luo 2021,,
Feasibility of a Computer Role-Playing Game to Promote Empathy in Nursing Students: The Role of Immersiveness and Perspective,"Ma, Z.; Huang, K. T.; Yao, L.","Empathy is considered a cornerstone of high-quality health care and a required element of nursing education. Although computer role-playing games (CRPGs) are a promising tool to promote clinical empathy, little is known about how and why it is effective at improving empathy. The goal of the current study is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a CRPG on nursing students' empathy with a focus on immersiveness and perspective. Results from a 2 x 2 (virtual reality [VR] vs. non-VR x patient's family's perspective vs. health care provider's perspective) between-subjects experiment (N = 69) showed that playing the game in VR (vs. non-VR) led to greater spatial presence and empathy. Moreover, playing from the health care provider's (vs. patient's family's) perspective elicited greater empathy. A moderated mediation effect was found, suggesting that users' attention allocation significantly mediated the effect of immersiveness on empathy in the patient's family's perspective condition. These findings show the feasibility of using a role-playing game for nursing education. Both theoretical and practical implications involving empathy training were discussed, along with suggestions for further research.",2021,,"Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",24,11,750-755,33989057,,,#8148,Ma 2021,,
High-fidelity simulation and virtual reality: an evaluation of medical students' experiences,"Macnamara, A. F.; Bird, K.; Rigby, A.; Sathyapalan, T.; Hepburn, D.","Background: Simulation technology is widely used in medical education, providing an environment in which students can develop and practise a multitude of skills that are relevant to clinical practice, without the risk of harm to patients.Methods: We conducted a mixed methods cross-over study with quantitative and qualitative outcomes. This analysed students' perceptions of two simulation technologies: a high-fidelity patient simulator and virtual reality. Twenty final year medical students completed a questionnaire after having experienced both simulation modalities.Results: Students scored the patient simulator higher in domains such as developing team working and 'ABCDE assessment skills', whereas the virtual reality simulation was more immersive and fun. Participants found the patient simulator more useful in preparing them for clinical practice.Conclusion: Medical students in this study expressed that a high-fidelity patient simulator, in a simulated clinical environment, was of greater value to their preparation for clinical practice than virtual reality simulation of a similar environment. However, the virtual reality simulation offered a near comparable experience, and was found to be was enjoyable, immersive and easily portable.",2021,,BMJ Simulation & Technology Enhanced Learning,7,6,528-535,35520971,,,#8155,Macnamara 2021,,
Introducing a Virtual Reality Experience in Anatomic Pathology Education,"Madrigal, E.; Prajapati, S.; Hernandez-Prera, J. C.","OBJECTIVES: A proper examination of surgical specimens is fundamental in anatomic pathology (AP) education. However, the resources available to residents may not always be suitable for efficient skill acquisition. We propose a method to enhance AP education by introducing high-definition videos featuring methods for appropriate specimen handling, viewable on two-dimensional (2D) and stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) platforms.METHODS: A stereo camera system recorded the gross processing of commonly encountered specimens. Three edited videos, with instructional audio voiceovers, were experienced by nine junior residents in a crossover study to assess the effects of the exposure (2D vs 3D movie views) on self-reported physiologic symptoms. A questionnaire was used to analyze viewer acceptance.RESULTS: All surveyed residents found the videos beneficial in preparation to examine a new specimen type. Viewer data suggest an improvement in specimen handling confidence and knowledge and enthusiasm toward 3D technology. None of the participants encountered significant motion sickness.CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method provides the foundation to create a robust teaching library. AP is inherently a visual discipline, and by building on the strengths of traditional teaching methods, our dynamic approach allows viewers to appreciate the procedural actions involved in specimen processing.",2016,,American Journal of Clinical Pathology,146,4,462-8,27594429,,,#8160,Madrigal 2016,,
Endovascular Training Using a Simulation Based Curriculum is Less Expensive than Training in the Hybrid Angiosuite,"Maertens, H.; Vermassen, F.; Aggarwal, R.; Doyen, B.; Desender, L.; Van Herzeele, I.; Annemans, L.","OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of a PROficiency based StePwise Endovascular Curricular Training (PROSPECT) program, including e-learning and hands on virtual reality simulation.METHODS: A prospective, single blinded, randomised controlled trial (RCT) was carried out to evaluate the impact of a PROSPECT training program on real life operative performance. Under supervision, all subjects performed two endovascular interventions on patients with symptomatic iliac and/or superficial femoral artery stenosis. Primary outcomes were technical performance (Global Rating Scale, Examiner Checklist), operative metrics, and patient outcomes, adjusted for case difficulty and the trainee's experience. Additionally, an analysis of costs and savings related to implementation of this endovascular training program was performed. Thirty-two general surgery trainees were randomised into three groups: group 1 (n = 11) received e-learning and simulation training (PROSPECT program); group 2 (n = 10) only had access to e-learning; group 3 (n = 11) did not receive supplementary education besides clinical training. Developmental cost, implementation cost, training time cost, and the operational cost of PROSPECT were determined. Time spent studying and practicing was converted to indirect saving of operating time. The costs of logistics, faculty time supervising simulation sessions, and 30 day complication rates were registered. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results.RESULTS: Fifty-eight peripheral endovascular interventions, performed by 29 surgical trainees (three dropouts) were included in this RCT from October 2014 to February 2016. Annual costs from the perspective of the hospital were 6589 for curriculum design, 31,484 for implementation, and 1143 in operational costs. Per trainee, simulation based training until proficiency cost 3806. In comparison, if endovascular proficiency levels were obtained with conventional training only, this may have cost 5001 per trainee.CONCLUSION: Simulation based training in endovascular procedures may be cost saving, because training occurs outside the angiosuite. It is possible that cost savings are underestimated as, in contrast to the literature, prevented costs related to complications could not be defined.",2018,,European Journal of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery,56,4,583-590,30131277,,,#8163,Maertens 2018,,
Meeting pharmacy educational outcomes through effective use of the virtual simulation MyDispense,"Mak, V.; Fitzgerald, J.; Holle, L.; Vordenberg, S. E.; Kebodeaux, C.","INTRODUCTION: One of the challenges of pharmacy schools worldwide is the need to link theoretical training with the mastery of practical skills. A virtual pharmacy simulation, MyDispense, developed by the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Monash University, enables students to practice the skills of a professional pharmacist, from novice to highly advanced, in a safe virtual environment that is web-based and highly accessible. The free online simulation allows students to undertake scenarios where patients can present with prescription or self-care requirements, and are also challenged with validation tasks requiring them to check the work of virtual colleagues for accuracy, legality, and medicine safety.COMMENTARY: This commentary describes the use of a virtual simulation, MyDispense, in enhancing didactic instruction, complementing experiential education, and the challenges of the virtual simulation to pharmacy educators. MyDispense is now deployed to 186 schools of pharmacy across 34 countries to over 25,000 students worldwide who have completed over 963,000 exercises globally.IMPLICATIONS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (aka COVID-19) pandemic presents challenges to pharmacy education requiring many educators to switch to remote online learning. Simulation programs, such as MyDispense, help to replicate aspects of pharmacy practice and can be used creatively to meet course needs. The use of MyDispense is an excellent example of pharmacy educators collaborating globally and learning from each other to improve student learning.",2021,,Currents in Pharmacy Teaching & Learning,13,7,739-742,34074500,,,#8185,Mak 2021,,
"Haptic, Physical, and Web-Based Simulators: Are They Underused in Maxillofacial Surgery Training?","Maliha, S. G.; Diaz-Siso, J. R.; Plana, N. M.; Torroni, A.; Flores, R. L.","PURPOSE: Surgical residencies have increasingly incorporated both digital and mannequin simulation into their training programs. The aim of our review was to identify all digital and mannequin maxillofacial simulators available for education and training, highlight their benefit, and critically assess the evidence in support of these educational resources.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature review of all peer-reviewed publications of digital and mannequin simulators that met the inclusion criteria, defined as any simulator used in education or training. All simulators used in surgical planning were excluded. Before the query, it was hypothesized that most studies would be descriptive in nature and supported by low levels of evidence. Literature search strategies included the use of multiple combinations of key search terms, review of titles and abstracts, and precise identification of the use of the simulator described. All statistics were descriptive.RESULTS: The primary search yielded 259 results, from which 22 total simulators published on from 2001 to 2016 were identified using the inclusion and exclusion criteria: 10 virtual reality haptic-based simulators, 6 physical model simulators, and 6 Web-based simulators used for a variety of procedures such as dental skills, instrument handling, orthognathic surgery (Le Fort I osteotomy, vertical ramus osteotomy, bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy), genioplasty, bone grafting, sinus surgery, cleft lip repair, orbital floor repair, and oral biopsy. Only 9 formalized studies were completed; these were classified as low-level evidence-based cohort studies (Levels IV and V). All other simulator reports were descriptive in nature. There were no studies with high levels of evidence completed (Level I to III).CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review suggest that, although seemingly beneficial to the trainee in maxillofacial surgery, simulation in education in this field is an underused commodity because of the significant lack of scientific and validated study designs reported on in the literature thus far. The maxillofacial and simulation communities would benefit from studies on utility and efficacy with higher levels of evidence.",2018,,Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery,76,11,2424.e1-2424.e11,30081008,,,#8189,Maliha 2018,,
Effect of real-time virtual reality-based teaching cues on learning needle passing for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery: a randomized controlled trial,"Malpani, A.; Vedula, S. S.; Lin, H. C.; Hager, G. D.; Taylor, R. H.","PURPOSE: Current virtual reality-based (VR) simulators for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) training lack effective teaching and coaching. Our objective was to develop an automated teaching framework for VR training in RAMIS. Second, we wanted to study the effect of such real-time teaching cues on surgical technical skill acquisition. Third, we wanted to assess skill in terms of surgical technique in addition to traditional time and motion efficiency metrics.METHODS: We implemented six teaching cues within a needle passing task on the da Vinci Skills Simulator platform (noncommercial research version). These teaching cues are graphical overlays designed to demonstrate ideal surgical technique, e.g., what path to follow while passing needle through tissue. We created three coaching modes: TEACH (continuous demonstration), METRICS (demonstration triggered by performance metrics), and USER (demonstration upon user request). We conducted a randomized controlled trial where the experimental group practiced using automated teaching and the control group practiced in a self-learning manner without automated teaching.RESULTS: We analyzed data from 30 participants (14 in experimental and 16 in control group). After three practice repetitions, control group showed higher improvement in time and motion efficiency, while experimental group showed higher improvement in surgical technique compared to their baseline measurements. The experimental group showed more improvement than the control group on a surgical technique metric (at what angle is needle grasped by an instrument), and the difference between groups was statistically significant.CONCLUSION: In a pilot randomized controlled trial, we observed that automated teaching cues can improve the performance of surgical technique in a VR simulator for RAMIS needle passing. Our study was limited by its recruitment of nonsurgeons and evaluation of a single configuration of coaching modes.",2020,,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology & Surgery,15,7,1187-1194,32385598,,,#8193,Malpani 2020,,
Immersive Virtual Reality for Surgical Training: A Systematic Review,"Mao, R. Q.; Lan, L.; Kay, J.; Lohre, R.; Ayeni, O. R.; Goel, D. P.; Sa, D.","BACKGROUND: Immersive virtual reality (iVR) simulators provide accessible, low cost, realistic training adjuncts in time and financially constrained systems. With increasing evidence and utilization of this technology by training programs, clarity on the effect of global skill training should be provided. This systematic review examines the current literature on the effectiveness of iVR for surgical skills acquisition in medical students, residents, and staff surgeons.METHODS: A literature search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science and PsycInfo for primary studies published between January 1, 2000 and January 26, 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, extracted data, and assessed quality and strength of evidence using the Medical Education Research Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and Cochrane methodology. Results were qualitatively synthesized, and descriptive statistics were calculated.RESULTS: The literature search yielded 9650 citations, with 17 articles included for qualitative synthesis. The mean (SD) MERSQI score was 11.7 (1.9) out of 18. In total, 307 participants completed training in four disciplines.

Skill-Oriented and Performance-Driven Adaptive Curricula for Training in Robot-Assisted Surgery Using Simulators: A Feasibility Study,"Mariani, A.; Pellegrini, E.; De Momi, E.","OBJECTIVE: Virtual Reality (VR) simulators represent a remarkable educational opportunity in order to acquire and refine surgical practical skills. Nevertheless, there exists no consensus regarding a standard curriculum of simulation-based training. This study introduces an automatic, adaptive curriculum where the training session is real-time scheduled on the basis of the trainee's performances.METHODS: An experimental study using the master console of the da Vinci Research Kit (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, US) was carried out to test this approach. Tasks involving fundamental skills of robotic surgery were designed and simulated in VR. Twelve participants without medical background along with twelve medical residents were randomly and equally divided into two groups: a control group, self-managing the training session, and an experimental group, undergoing the proposed adaptive training.RESULTS: The performances of the experimental users were significantly better with respect to the ones of the control group after training (non-medical: p < 0.01; medical: p = 0.02). This trend was analogous in the non-medical and medical populations and no significant difference was identified between these two classes (even in the baseline assessment).CONCLUSION: The analysis of the learning of the involved surgical skills highlighted how the proposed adaptive training managed to better identify and compensate for the trainee's gaps. The absence of initial difference between the non-medical and medical users underlines that robotic surgical devices require specific training before clinical practice.SIGNIFICANCE: This feasibility study could pave the way towards the improvement of simulation-based training curricula.",2021,,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,68,2,685-694,32746071,,,#8218,Mariani 2021,,
Evolution of a Novel Robotic Training Curriculum in a Complex General Surgical Oncology Fellowship,"Mark Knab, L.; Zenati, M. S.; Khodakov, A.; Rice, M.; Al-Abbas, A.; Bartlett, D. L.; Zureikat, A. H.; Zeh, H. J.; Hogg, M. E.","BACKGROUND: Robotic surgery is increasingly being used for complex oncologic operations, although currently there is no standardized curriculum in place for surgical oncologists. We describe the evolution of a proficiency-based robotic training program implemented for surgical oncology fellows, and demonstrate the outcomes of the program.METHODS: A 5-step robotic curriculum began integration in July 2013. Fellows from July 2013 to August 2017 were included. An education portfolio was created for each fellow, including pre-fellowship experience, fellowship experience with data from robotic curriculum and operative experience, and post-fellowship practice information.RESULTS: Of 30 fellows, 20% completed a prior fellowship, 97% trained at an academic residency, 57% had prior robotic training (median 5 h), and 43% had performed robotic surgery (median 0 cases). In fellowship, on average, fellows spent 5 h on the virtual reality curriculum and performed 19 biotissue anastomoses. For total surgeries, fellows operating from the console increased over time (p = 0.005). For pancreas, the average percentage of robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) steps completed increased (p < 0.011), as did the number of PDs in which the fellow completed the entire resection (p = 0.013). Fellows were 10 times more likely to complete the entire distal than PD from the console (p < 0.01). Post-fellowship, 83% of fellows obtained an academic position, 88% utilized robotics, and 91% performed pancreatic surgery.CONCLUSIONS: With dedicated training, fellows can safely primarily perform complex gastrointestinal robotic surgeries and, after graduation, take jobs incorporating this skill set. In this era of scrutiny on cost and outcomes, specialized training programs offer a safe integration option for complex technical skills.",2018,,Annals of Surgical Oncology,25,12,3445-3452,30073601,,,#8226,MarkKnab 2018,,

This quasi-experimental study aimed to examine the impact on empathy, knowledge, and attitudes towards people with schizophrenia of a VR simulation that reproduces the experience of psychotic symptoms while performing a cognitive task compared with watching a 2D video and, thus, how these experiences could reduce stigma towards people diagnosed with schizophrenia. The sample comprised of 102 higher education health students, distributed by the experimental and control groups. The impact of the program was measured by completing multiple questionnaires on levels of empathy, attitudes, and mental health knowledge. Both methods (VR and 2D video) were, to a certain extent, effective. However, VR was more effective at eliciting attitudes and knowledge change compared to the control group. These findings suggest that not only VR but also 2D videos could be interesting strategies to enhance empathy and improve attitudes towards people with schizophrenia in higher education health students.",2022,,Frontiers in Psychology,13,,814984,35602736,,,#8230,Marques 2022,,
Exploring the effects of a high-fidelity environment on nursing students' confidence and performance of CPR,"Mather, C.; McCarthy, R.","BACKGROUND: Simulation is often used in healthcare education because it enables students to practise clinical skills in a safe environment where mistakes can occur without the risk of patient harm. Simulation can involve varying levels of fidelity (realism), ranging from low fidelity (for example, using role play) to high fidelity (for example, using sophisticated technology such as augmented or virtual reality).AIM: To investigate if a high-fidelity simulation environment improves confidence and the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in first-year undergraduate adult nursing students.METHOD: This small pilot study involved a sample of 15 participants who were randomised into an intervention group (n=7) and a control group (n=8). The control group received teaching and were tested on the skill of CPR using a manikin in a medium-fidelity simulation scenario in a modified classroom environment, while the intervention group received the same teaching, testing and simulation scenario but in a high-fidelity 'immersion suite'. Quantitative data were collected using a pre-intervention and post-intervention self-report confidence questionnaire and from performance data generated by the Laerdal Medical 'Little Anne' manikin QCPR software.RESULTS: Overall, there were no statistically significant improvements in performance metrics for the intervention group compared with the control group. Both groups reported overall improvements in confidence regarding their knowledge and skills in managing a critically ill patient, but these results were not deemed to be statistically significant.CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the use of simulation increases nursing students' confidence in undertaking CPR, but that a high-fidelity simulation environment does not necessarily improve their performance of CPR.",2021,,Nursing Standard,36,2,76-82,33501814,,,#8270,Mather 2021,,
Predictors of laparoscopic simulation performance among practicing obstetrician gynecologists,"Mathews, S.; Brodman, M.; D'Angelo, D.; Chudnoff, S.; McGovern, P.; Kolev, T.; Bensinger, G.; Mudiraj, S.; Nemes, A.; Feldman, D.; Kischak, P.; Ascher-Walsh, C.","BACKGROUND: While simulation training has been established as an effective method for improving laparoscopic surgical performance in surgical residents, few studies have focused on its use for attending surgeons, particularly in obstetrics and gynecology. Surgical simulation may have a role in improving and maintaining proficiency in the operating room for practicing obstetrician gynecologists.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if parameters of performance for validated laparoscopic virtual simulation tasks correlate with surgical volume and characteristics of practicing obstetricians and gynecologists.STUDY DESIGN: All gynecologists with laparoscopic privileges (n = 347) from 5 academic medical centers in New York City were required to complete a laparoscopic surgery simulation assessment. The physicians took a presimulation survey gathering physician self-reported characteristics and then performed 3 basic skills tasks (enforced peg transfer, lifting/grasping, and cutting) on the LapSim virtual reality laparoscopic simulator (Surgical Science Ltd, Gothenburg, Sweden). The association between simulation outcome scores (time, efficiency, and errors) and self-rated clinical skills measures (self-rated laparoscopic skill score or surgical volume category) were examined with regression models.RESULTS: The average number of laparoscopic procedures per month was a significant predictor of total time on all 3 tasks (P = .001 for peg transfer; P = .041 for lifting and grasping; P < .001 for cutting). Average monthly laparoscopic surgical volume was a significant predictor of 2 efficiency scores in peg transfer, and all 4 efficiency scores in cutting (P = .001 to P = .015). Surgical volume was a significant predictor of errors in lifting/grasping and cutting (P < .001 for both). Self-rated laparoscopic skill level was a significant predictor of total time in all 3 tasks (P < .0001 for peg transfer; P = .009 for lifting and grasping; P < .001 for cutting) and a significant predictor of nearly all efficiency scores and errors scores in all 3 tasks.CONCLUSION: In addition to total time, there was at least 1 other objective performance measure that significantly correlated with surgical volume for each of the 3 tasks. Higher-volume physicians and those with fellowship training were more confident in their laparoscopic skills. By determining simulation performance as it correlates to active physician practice, further studies may help assess skill and individualize training to maintain skill levels as case volumes fluctuate.",2017,,American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology,217,5,596.e1-596.e7,28712950,,,#8272,Mathews 2017,"Shannon Bailey (2023-01-11 08:55:20)(Screen): this study is predictors of simulation performance, not simulation performance on real-world performance ; ",

Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality-Translating Surgical Training into Surgical Technique,"McKnight, R. R.; Pean, C. A.; Buck, J. S.; Hwang, J. S.; Hsu, J. R.; Pierrie, S. N.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As immersive learning outside of the operating room is increasingly recognized as a valuable method of surgical training, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are increasingly utilized in orthopedic surgical training. This article reviews the evolving nature of these training tools and provides examples of their use and efficacy. The practical and ethical implications of incorporating this technology and its impact on both orthopedic surgeons and their patients are also discussed.RECENT FINDINGS: Head-mounted displays (HMDs) represent a possible adjunct to surgical accuracy and education. While the hardware is advanced, there is still much work to be done in developing software that allows for seamless, reliable, useful integration into clinical practice and training. Surgical training is changing: AR and VR will become mainstays of future training efforts. More evidence is needed to determine which training technology translates to improved clinical performance. Volatility within the HMD industry will likely delay advances in surgical training.",2020,,Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine,13,6,663-674,32779019,,,#8308,McKnight 2020,,
'Sorry doctor....I didn't hear that....': phenomenological analysis of medical students' experiences of simulated hearing impairment through virtual reality,"McLaughlin, N.; Rogers, J.; D'Arcy, J.; Gormley, G.","Introduction: Hearing impairment is a common condition that can have a significant impact on an individual. Ineffective communication between such individuals and doctors remains an important barrier. There is a need to provide medical students with a deeper understanding of such challenges. Increasingly, simulation is being used to develop empathy skills. In this study, we aimed to seek a deep understanding of medical students' experiences of being placed in the role of a hearing-impaired patient by means of a virtual reality (VR) simulation.Methods: A multidisciplinary group developed a 360degree VR video-learning experience. This experience portrayed a consultation with a doctor from a hearing-impaired individual's perspective. A qualitative study approach, using hermeneutic phenomenology, was conducted. Following the VR experience, students were interviewed, and transcripts of interviews were analysed using a Template Analysis approach.Results: Analysis yielded four main themes: (1) 'much more than just watching a video': a VR experience of hearing impairment; (2) 'hearing through their ears': experiencing a person's world with hearing impairment; (3) 'not just what you can't hear...but how it makes you feel': reactions evoked by a VR hearing impairment experience and (4) redirecting my future professional self?Discussion: This study provides an insight into medical students' experiences of a novel VR hearing impairment simulation. VR simulation has the potential to provide a novel complementary training method for medical students. By providing an immersive learning experience, VR can offer an empathic stepping into the ears of those that live with hearing impairment.",2021,,BMJ Simulation & Technology Enhanced Learning,7,4,207-215,35516833,,,#8309,McLaughlin 2021,,
See Like an Expert: Gaze-Augmented Training Enhances Skill Acquisition in a Virtual Reality Robotic Suturing Task,"Melnyk, R.; Campbell, T.; Holler, T.; Cameron, K.; Saba, P.; Witthaus, M. W.; Joseph, J.; Ghazi, A.","<b>Introduction:</b> The da Vinci Skills Simulator (DVSS) is an effective platform for robotic skills training. Novel training methods using expert gaze patterns to guide trainees have demonstrated superiority to traditional instruction. Portable head-mounted eye-trackers (HMET) offer the opportunity for eye tracking technology to enhance surgical robotic simulation training. <b>Objective:</b> To evaluate if training guided by expert gaze patterns can improve trainee performance over standard movement training techniques during robotic simulation. <b>Methods:</b> Medical students were recruited and randomized into gaze training (GT, n = 9) and movement training (MT, n = 8) groups. First, the participants reviewed an instructional video, with the GT group emulating expert gaze patterns and the MT group (n = 8) standard movement-based instruction. Training consisted of 10 repetitions of ""Suture Sponge 3"" on the DVSS while wearing HMET; the first three repetitions were followed by group-appropriate video coaching (gaze vs movement feedback), while the remaining repetitions were without feedback. Finally, two multitasking repetitions with a secondary bell-counting task were completed. Primary outcomes included DVSS scores during training and multitasking. Secondary outcomes included metrics collected from the HMET (gaze patterns and gaze entropy). <b>Results:</b> Total score, efficiency, and penalties improved significantly over the training in both groups; the GT group achieved higher scores on every attempt. Total scores in the GT group were higher than the MT group postvideo review (20.3 +/- 21.8 vs 3.0 +/- 6.2, p = 0.047), after coaching repetitions (61.8 +/- 18.8 vs 30.1 +/- 26.2, p = 0.01), and at the last training attempt (73.0 +/- 16.5 vs 63.1 +/- 17.4, p = 0.247). During multitasking, the GT group maintained higher total scores (75 +/- 10.1 vs 63.3 +/- 15.3, p = 0.01), efficiency (86.3 +/- 7.4 vs 77.4 +/- 11.2, p = 0.009), and superior secondary task performance (error: 6.3% +/- 0.06 vs 10.7% +/- 0.11, p = 0.20). Gaze entropy (cognitive-load indicator) and gaze pattern analysis showed similar trends. <b>Conclusion: </b> Gaze-augmented training leads to more efficient movements through adoption of expert gaze patterns that withstand additional stressors.",2021,,Journal of Endourology,35,3,376-382,32967467,,,#8320,Melnyk 2021,,
Using Learning Curves to Identify and Explain Growth Patterns of Learners in Bronchoscopy Simulation: A Mixed-Methods Study,"Mema, B.; Mylopoulos, M.; Tekian, A.; Park, Y. S.","PURPOSE: Learning curves can illustrate how trainees acquire skills and the path to competence. This study examined the growth trajectories of novice trainees while practicing on a bronchoscopy virtual reality (VR) simulator compared with those of experts.METHOD: This was a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. Twenty pediatric subspecialty trainees and 7 faculty practiced with the VR simulator (October 2017 to March 2018) at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. The authors examined the relationship between number of repetitions and VR outcomes and patterns of growth using a growth mixture modeling. Using an instrumental case study design, field notes and semistructured interviews with trainees and simulation instructor were examined to explain the patterns of growth. The authors used a constant comparative approach to identify themes iteratively. Team analysis continued until a stable thematic structure was developed and applied to the entire data.RESULTS: The growth mixture model identified 2 patterns of growth. A slower growth included learners that had inherent difficulty with the skill, did not integrate the knowledge of anatomy in simulation practice, and used the simulator for simple repetitive practice with no strategy for improvement in between trials. The faster growth included learners who used an adaptive expertise approach: integrating knowledge of anatomy, finding flexible solutions, and creating a deeper conceptual understanding.CONCLUSIONS: The authors provide validity evidence for use of growth models in education and explain patterns of growth such as a ""slow growth"" with a mechanistic repetitive practice and a ""fast growth"" with adaptive expertise.",2020,,Academic Medicine,95,12,1921-1928,32675795,,,#8322,Mema 2020,,
PINATA: Pinpoint insertion of intravenous needles via augmented reality training assistance,"Mendes, H. C. M.; Costa, Ciab; da Silva, N. A.; Leite, F. P.; Esteves, A.; Lopes, D. S.","Conventional needle insertion training relies on medical dummies that simulate surface anatomy and internal structures such as veins or arteries. These dummies offer an interesting space to augment with useful information to assist training practices, namely, internal anatomical structures (subclavian artery and vein, internal jugular vein and carotid artery) along with target point, desired inclination, position and orientation of the needle. However, limited research has been conducted on Optical See-Through Augmented Reality (OST-AR) interfaces for training needle insertion, especially for central venous catheterization (CVC). In this work we introduce PINATA, an interactive tool to explore the benefits of OST-AR in CVC training using a dummy of the upper torso and neck; andexplore if PINATA complements conventional training practices.. Our design contribution also describes the observation and co-design sessions used to collect user requirements, usability aspects and user preferences. This was followed by a comparative study with 18 participants - attending specialists and medical residents - that performed needle insertion tasks for CVC with PINATAand the conventional training system. The performance was objectively measured by task completion time and number of needle insertion errors. A correlation was found between the task completion time in the two training methods, suggesting the concurrent validity of our OST-AR tool. An inherent difference in the task completion time (p =0.040) and in the number of errors (p=0.036) between novices and experts proved the construct validity of the new tool. The qualitative answers of the participants also suggest its face and content validity, a high acceptability rate and a medium perceived workload. Finally, the result of semi-structured interviews with these 18 participants revealed that 14 of them considered that PINATA can complement the conventional training system, especially due to the visibility of the vessels inside the simulator. 13 agreed that OST-AR adoption in these scenarios is likely, particularly during early stages of training. Integration with ultrasound information was highlighted as necessary future work. In sum, the overall results show that the OST-AR tool proposed can complement the conventional training of CVC.",2020,,Computerized Medical Imaging & Graphics,82,,101731,32361555,,,#8323,Mendes 2020,,
Evaluation of an Augmented Reality Application for Learning Neuroanatomy in Psychology,"Mendez-Lopez, M.; Juan, M. C.; Molla, R.; Fidalgo, C.","Neuroanatomy is difficult for psychology students because of spatial visualization and the relationship among brain structures. Some technologies have been implemented to facilitate the learning of anatomy using three-dimensional (3D) visualization of anatomy contents. Augmented reality (AR) is a promising technology in this field. A mobile AR application to provide the visualization of morphological and functional information of the brain was developed. A sample of 67 students of neuropsychology completed tests for visuospatial ability, anatomical knowledge, learning goals, and experience with technologies. Subsequently, they performed a learning activity using one of the visualization methods considered: a 3D method using the AR application and a two-dimensional (2D) method using a textbook to color, followed by questions concerning their satisfaction and knowledge. After using the alternative method, the students expressed their preference. The two methods improved knowledge equally, but the 3D method obtained higher satisfaction scores and was more preferred by students. The 3D method was also more preferred by the students who used this method during the activity. After controlling for the method used in the activity, associations were found between the preference of the 3D method because of its usability and experience with technologies. These results found that the AR application was highly valued by students to learn and was as effective as the textbook for this purpose.",2022,,Anatomical sciences education,15,3,535-551,33866682,,,#8324,Mendez-Lopez 2022,,
Development of Ophthalmic Microsurgery Training in Augmented Reality,"Menozzi, M.; Ropelat, S.; Kofler, J.; Huang, Y. Y.","BACKGROUND: Using a group of 23 physician trainees, we investigated whether microsurgery training in an augmented reality (AR) training simulator improves motor skills and whether an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) improves training efficiency.METHODS: Characteristic motor skill steps involved in the peeling of an internal limiting membrane (ILM) were identified and implemented in the AR simulation. For training, implemented steps were either presented in the natural sequence, as in a real ILM surgery, or administered according to the ITS. Participants underwent the training over 5 days for 10 minutes per day. A subgroup of 11 participants performed the 5 microsurgical steps in a natural sequence. The other 12 participants used the ITS method. Motor skill performance was recorded before and after each training session with the AR simulator, and before the first and after the last training session using a method that did not rely on AR.RESULTS: Five steps of the ILM peeling procedure were identified and implemented: insertion of the instrument, flap creation, clockwise peeling, counterclockwise peeling, and retraction of the instrument. Both training methods significantly improved the motor skills of the participants. In both methods, steep learning progress was found within the first three training sessions. In both methods, motor skills continued to improve on days 4 and 5, but at a slower rate. After the 5 training days, performance was significantly improved, but improvement did not depend significantly on the training method. However, within the first 3 days of training, ITS led to steeper training progress than the natural sequence method.CONCLUSION: It is possible to improve microsurgical motor skills using the implemented AR simulation. Some technical limitations, such as system lag, deserve further improvements. However, the proposed AR solution was highly appreciated by the participants and could help overcome constraints of practice in microsurgical training, such as limited availability of training opportunities or a standardized assessment of motor skill performance.",2020,,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,237,4,388-391,32330977,,,#8328,Menozzi 2020,,
Second Life Patient Scenarios: Enhancing the Diversity of the Nursing Profession,"Metcalfe, S.","Despite the current transformation of the U.S. population to one of increased diversity, the majority of nurses employed are from White backgrounds. In addition, few secondary school students from ethnically diverse backgrounds or from rural regions in the nation are encouraged to pursue a collegiate education or to consider nursing as a career. This article describes an innovative 3-year program in which one rural university in the southeast used a virtual environment, Second Life, to expose secondary students to nursing through role-playing as avatars interacting with patient case scenarios. Secondary school science and health occupations teachers developed patient and environmental scenarios under the direction of the nursing program director and the information technology director from the university. Throughout the 3 years, 300 rural and multicultural students were exposed to virtual world health care learning through quizzes with five patient case and environmental scenarios. Student and teacher evaluations were positive about their interest in learning obtained through the patient case examinations. Technical difficulties during Year 1 were eliminated by Year 3. This program demonstrates that use of virtual technologies such as Second Life may increase the interest of secondary rural and multicultural students in careers in nursing and in pursuing a collegiate education.",2016,,Creative Nursing,22,3,166-170,29195525,,,#8331,Metcalfe 2016,,
Training of clinical reasoning with a Serious Game versus small-group problem-based learning: A prospective study,"Middeke, A.; Anders, S.; Schuelper, M.; Raupach, T.; Schuelper, N.","INTRODUCTION: Serious Games are increasingly being used in undergraduate medical education. They are usually intended to enhance learning with a focus on knowledge acquisition and skills development. According to the current literature, few studies have assessed their effectiveness regarding clinical reasoning (CR). The aim of this prospective study was to compare a Serious Game, the virtual Accident & Emergency department 'EMERGE' to small-group problem-based learning (PBL) regarding student learning outcome on clinical reasoning in the short term.METHODS: A total of 112 final-year medical students self-selected to participate in ten 90-minute sessions of either small-group PBL or playing EMERGE. CR was assessed in a formative examination consisting of six key feature cases and a final 45-minute EMERGE session.RESULTS: Overall, the EMERGE group (n = 78) scored significantly higher than the PBL group (n = 34) in the key feature examination (62.5 (IQR: 17.7)% vs. 54.2 (IQR: 21.9)%; p = 0.015). There was no significant difference in performance levels between groups regarding those cases which had been discussed in both instructional formats during the training phase. In the final EMERGE session, the EMERGE group achieved significantly better results than the PBL group in all four cases regarding the total score as well as in three of four cases regarding the final diagnosis and the correct therapeutic interventions.CONCLUSION: EMERGE can be used effectively for CR training in undergraduate medical education. The difference in key feature exam scores was driven by additional exposure to more cases in EMERGE compared to PBL despite identical learning time in both instructional formats. EMERGE is a potential alternative to intensive small-group teaching. Further work is needed to establish how Serious Games enhance CR most effectively.",2018,,PLoS ONE [Electronic Resource],13,9,e0203851,30204773,,,#8340,Middeke 2018,,
Simulation-Based Training Platforms for Arthroscopy: A Randomized Comparison of Virtual Reality Learning to Benchtop Learning,"Middleton, R. M.; Alvand, A.; Garfjeld Roberts, P.; Hargrove, C.; Kirby, G.; Rees, J. L.","PURPOSE: To determine whether a virtual reality (VR) arthroscopy simulator or benchtop (BT) arthroscopy simulator showed superiority as a training tool.METHODS: Arthroscopic novices were randomized to a training program on a BT or a VR knee arthroscopy simulator. The VR simulator provided user performance feedback. Individuals performed a diagnostic arthroscopy on both simulators before and after the training program. Performance was assessed using wireless objective motion analysis and a global rating scale.RESULTS: The groups (8 in the VR group, 9 in the BT group) were well matched at baseline across all parameters (P > .05). Training on each simulator resulted in significant performance improvements across all parameters (P < .05). BT training conferred a significant improvement in all parameters when trainees were reassessed on the VR simulator (P < .05). In contrast, VR training did not confer improvement in performance when trainees were reassessed on the BT simulator (P > .05). BT-trained subjects outperformed VR-trained subjects in all parameters during final assessments on the BT simulator (P < .05). There was no difference in objective performance between VR-trained and BT-trained subjects on final VR simulator wireless objective motion analysis assessment (P > .05).CONCLUSIONS: Both simulators delivered improvements in arthroscopic skills. BT training led to skills that readily transferred to the VR simulator. Skills acquired after VR training did not transfer as readily to the BT simulator. Despite trainees receiving automated metric feedback from the VR simulator, the results suggest a greater gain in psychomotor skills for BT training. Further work is required to determine if this finding persists in the operating room.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study suggests that there are differences in skills acquired on different simulators and skills learnt on some simulators may be more transferable. Further work in identifying user feedback metrics that enhance learning is also required.",2017,,Arthroscopy,33,5,996-1003,28073670,,,#8341,Middleton 2017,,
Virtual Reality Triage Training Can Provide Comparable Simulation Efficacy for Paramedicine Students Compared to Live Simulation-Based Scenarios,"Mills, B.; Dykstra, P.; Hansen, S.; Miles, A.; Rankin, T.; Hopper, L.; Brook, L.; Bartlett, D.","<b>Background:</b> Mass-casualty incidents (MCIs) are catastrophic. Whether they arise from natural or man-made disasters, the nature of such incidents and the multiple casualties involved can rapidly overwhelm response personnel. Mass-casualty triage training is traditionally taught via either didactic lectures or table top exercises. This training fails to provide an opportunity for practical application or experiential learning in immersive conditions. Further, large-scale simulations are heavily resource-intensive, logistically challenging, require the coordination and time of multiple personnel, and are costly to replicate.

The Virtual Operative Assistant: An explainable artificial intelligence tool for simulation-based training in surgery and medicine,"Mirchi, N.; Bissonnette, V.; Yilmaz, R.; Ledwos, N.; Winkler-Schwartz, A.; Del Maestro, R. F.","Simulation-based training is increasingly being used for assessment and training of psychomotor skills involved in medicine. The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has provided new methodologies to utilize large amounts of data for educational purposes. A significant criticism of the use of artificial intelligence in education has been a lack of transparency in the algorithms' decision-making processes. This study aims to 1) introduce a new framework using explainable artificial intelligence for simulation-based training in surgery, and 2) validate the framework by creating the Virtual Operative Assistant, an automated educational feedback platform. Twenty-eight skilled participants (14 staff neurosurgeons, 4 fellows, 10 PGY 4-6 residents) and 22 novice participants (10 PGY 1-3 residents, 12 medical students) took part in this study. Participants performed a virtual reality subpial brain tumor resection task on the NeuroVR simulator using a simulated ultrasonic aspirator and bipolar. Metrics of performance were developed, and leave-one-out cross validation was employed to train and validate a support vector machine in Matlab. The classifier was combined with a unique educational system to build the Virtual Operative Assistant which provides users with automated feedback on their metric performance with regards to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The Virtual Operative Assistant successfully classified skilled and novice participants using 4 metrics with an accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 92, 82 and 100%, respectively. A 2-step feedback system was developed to provide participants with an immediate visual representation of their standing related to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The educational system outlined establishes a basis for the potential role of integrating artificial intelligence and virtual reality simulation into surgical educational teaching. The potential of linking expertise classification, objective feedback based on proficiency benchmarks, and instructor input creates a novel educational tool by integrating these three components into a formative educational paradigm.",2020,,PLoS ONE [Electronic Resource],15,2,e0229596,32106247,,,#8358,Mirchi 2020,,

Proficiency-based training of medical students using virtual simulators for laparoscopy and robot-assisted surgery: results of a pilot study,"Moglia, A.; Sinceri, S.; Ferrari, V.; Ferrari, M.; Mosca, F.; Morelli, L.","Proficiency-based training has become essential in the training of surgeons such that on completion they can execute complex operations with novel surgical approaches including direct manual laparoscopic surgery (DMLS) and robotically assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS). To this effect, several virtual reality (VR) simulators have been developed. The objective of the present study was to assess and establish proficiency gain curves for medical students on VR simulators for DMLS and RALS. Five medical students participated in training course consisting of didactic teaching and practical hands-on training with VR simulators for DMLS and RALS. Evaluation of didactic component was by questionnaire completed by participating students, who also were required to undertake selected exercises to reach proficiency at each VR simulator: (1) 12 tasks on LapSim VR (Surgical Science, Gothenburg, Sweden) for DMLS, and (2) six selected exercises on the dV-Trainer Mimic (Seattle, WA, United States).

Use of a Virtual Reality Simulator for Tendon Repair Training: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Mok, T. N.; Chen, J.; Pan, J.; Ming, W. K.; He, Q.; Sin, T. H.; Deng, J.; Li, J.; Zha, Z.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) simulators have become widespread tools for training medical students and residents in medical schools. Students using VR simulators are provided with a 3D human model to observe the details by using multiple senses and they can participate in an environment that is similar to reality.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to promote a new approach consisting of a shared and independent study platform for medical orthopedic students, to compare traditional tendon repair training with VR simulation of tendon repair, and to evaluate future applications of VR simulation in the academic medical field.METHODS: In this study, 121 participants were randomly allocated to VR or control groups. The participants in the VR group studied the tendon repair technique via the VR simulator, while the control group followed traditional tendon repair teaching methods. The final assessment for the medical students involved performing tendon repair with the ""Kessler tendon repair with 2 interrupted tendon repair knots"" (KS) method and the ""Bunnell tendon repair with figure 8 tendon repair"" (BS) method on a synthetic model. The operative performance was evaluated using the global rating scale.RESULTS: Of the 121 participants, 117 participants finished the assessment and 4 participants were lost to follow-up. The overall performance (a total score of 35) of the VR group using the KS method and the BS method was significantly higher (P<.001) than that of the control group. Thus, participants who received VR simulator training had a significantly higher score on the global rating scale than those who received traditional tendon repair training (P<.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that compared with the traditional tendon repair method, the VR simulator for learning tendon suturing resulted in a significant improvement of the medical students in the time in motion, flow of operation, and knowledge of the procedure. Therefore, VR simulator development in the future would most likely be beneficial for medical education and clinical practice.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2100046648; http://www.chictr.org.cn/hvshowproject.aspx?id=90180.",2021,,JMIR Serious Games,9,3,e27544,34255649,,,#8392,Mok 2021,,
Development of In-situ Simulation Lab for Training Gynecology Residents in Basic Laparoscopic and Hysteroscopic Operative Skills,"Molina, M. M.; Le, T. H.; Delaney, H.; Weir, L. F.","INTRODUCTION: Mounting evidence suggests that practice on simulators leads to improved operative skills and patient safety. With restrictions on resident work hours resulting in less exposure to procedures, simulation is the key to developing operative skills during residency and beyond. Residency programs struggle with implementing a simulation program due to timing and availability of residents. Despite having a large centralized simulation space at our institution, we identified lack of dedicated gynecologic simulation curriculum and simulator accessibility as our greatest barriers to utilizing simulation training in gynecology resident education. We sought to design a space within the resident work area dedicated to gynecologic simulation training with specific curriculum and objectives for each work station based on residency year level.METHODS: We created four workstations in a room within the Ob/Gyn clinic, in close proximity to the resident offices. Two virtual reality simulators, the LapVR (CAE, Montreal, Canada) ($84,996.00) and Simbionix Hystsim (3D Systems, (formerly Simbionix), CO, USA) ($95,741.10), were acquired from our institution's simulation center and placed in this training space to allow for enhanced resident access. The two other work stations consisted of an FLS trainer box and monitor ($1580) and another low fidelity laparoscopic box trainer and monitor ($450). Specific objectives for each station with corresponding evaluation checklists were written for each residency year level. Dedicated time to meet the written objectives was given to residents each week during their benign gynecology rotation. Supervision and assistance with task completion was provided by staff mentors assigned during those shifts.RESULTS: Residents who had this simulation lab available to them during their gynecology rotation participated in a minimum of seven hours of simulation time in addition to the time they spent on their own in the lab. These residents felt this was a meaningful increase in the amount of laparoscopic and hysteroscopic simulation exposure by having access to this in-situ GYN Simulation Training Laboratory with a defined gynecologic curriculum. Multiple staff members also took advantage of the simulation lab to practice their skills as well.CONCLUSIONS: We created an in-situ Gyn Simulation Training Lab that allowed for both improved accessibility by the residents and ease of implementation of simulation curriculum into pre-existing resident didactic time. It is our opinion that the time residents spend engaged in surgical simulation will improve surgical skills and confidence thereby enhancing patient safety. Additionally, the creation of this in situ simulation lab assists in meeting the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requirements for incorporation of simulation into OB/GYN resident education.",2019,,Cureus,11,4,e4385,31223545,,,#8398,Molina 2019,,
Hands-free interaction in immersive virtual reality: A systematic review,"Monteiro, P.; Goncalves, G.; Coelho, H.; Melo, M.; Bessa, M.","Hands are the most important tool to interact with virtual environments, and they should be available to perform the most critical tasks. For example, a surgeon in VR should keep his/her hands on the instruments and be able to do secondary tasks without performing a disruptive event to the operative task. In this common scenario, one can observe that hands are not available for interaction. The goal of this systematic review is to survey the literature and identify which hands-free interfaces are used, the performed interaction tasks, what metrics are used for interface evaluation, and the results of such evaluations. From 79 studies that met the eligibility criteria, the voice is the most studied interface, followed by the eye and head gaze. Some novel interfaces were brain interfaces and face expressions. System control and selection represent most of the interaction tasks studied and most studies evaluate interfaces for usability. Despite the best interface depending on the task and study, the voice was found to be versatile and showed good results amongst the studies. More research is recommended to improve the practical use of the interfaces and to evaluate the interfaces more formally.",2021,,IEEE Transactions on Visualization & Computer Graphics,27,5,2702-2713,33750693,,,#8403,Monteiro 2021,,

Fourteen residents in ophthalmology performed at least 30 VR training sessions to diagnose esotropia and exotropia. Examinations of real patients with esotropia or exotropia before and after the VR training were video-recorded and presented to a strabismus expert to assess accuracy and performance scores for measuring the deviation angle and diagnosing strabismus with anonymization. A feedback survey regarding the usefulness and ease of use of the VR application was conducted for participants. The mean age of the 14 ophthalmology residents (10 men and 4 women), was 29.7 years. Before VR training, participants showed a mean accuracy score of 14.50 +/- 5.45 and a performance score of 9.64 +/- 4.67 for measuring the deviation angle and diagnosing strabismus in real patients with strabismus. After VR training, they showed a significantly improved accuracy score of 22.14 +/- 4.37 (p = 0.012) and a performance score of 15.50 +/- 1.99 (p = 0.011).

Designing Virtual Reality-Based Conversational Agents to Train Clinicians in Verbal De-escalation Skills: Exploratory Usability Study,"Moore, N.; Ahmadpour, N.; Brown, M.; Poronnik, P.; Davids, J.","BACKGROUND: Violence and aggression are significant workplace challenges faced by clinicians worldwide. Traditional methods of training consist of ""on-the-job learning"" and role-play simulations. Although both approaches can result in improved skill levels, they are not without limitation. Interactive simulations using virtual reality (VR) can complement traditional training processes as a cost-effective, engaging, easily accessible, and flexible training tool.OBJECTIVE: In this exploratory study, we aimed to determine the feasibility of and barriers to verbal engagement with a virtual agent in the context of the Code Black VR application. Code Black VR is a new interactive VR-based verbal de-escalation trainer that we developed based on the Clinical Training Through VR Design Framework.METHODS: In total, 28 participants with varying clinical expertise from 4 local hospitals enrolled in the Western Sydney Local Health District Clinical Initiative Nurse program and Transition to Emergency Nursing Programs and participated in 1 of 5 workshops. They completed multiple playthroughs of the Code Black VR verbal de-escalation trainer application and verbally interacted with a virtual agent. We documented observations and poststudy reflection notes. After the playthroughs, the users completed the System Usability Scale and provided written comments on their experience. A thematic analysis was conducted on the results. Data were also obtained through the application itself, which also recorded the total interactions and successfully completed interactions.RESULTS: The Code Black VR verbal de-escalation training application was well received. The findings reinforced the factors in the existing design framework and identified 3 new factors-motion sickness, perceived value, and privacy-to be considered for future application development.CONCLUSIONS: Verbal interaction with a virtual agent is feasible for training staff in verbal de-escalation skills. It is an effective medium to supplement clinician training in verbal de-escalation skills.

Exploring User Needs in the Development of a Virtual Reality-Based Advanced Life Support Training Platform: Exploratory Usability Study,"Moore, N.; Yoo, S.; Poronnik, P.; Brown, M.; Ahmadpour, N.","BACKGROUND: Traditional methods of delivering Advanced Life Support (ALS) training and reaccreditation are resource-intensive and costly. Interactive simulations and gameplay using virtual reality (VR) technology can complement traditional training processes as a cost-effective, engaging, and flexible training tool.OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study aimed to determine the specific user needs of clinicians engaging with a new interactive VR ALS simulation (ALS-SimVR) application to inform the ongoing development of such training platforms.METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with experienced clinicians (n=10, median age=40.9 years) following a single playthrough of the application. All clinicians have been directly involved in the delivery of ALS training in both clinical and educational settings (median years of ALS experience=12.4; all had minimal or no VR experience). Interviews were supplemented with an assessment of usability (using heuristic evaluation) and presence.RESULTS: The ALS-SimVR training app was well received. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed five main areas of user needs that can inform future design efforts for creating engaging VR training apps: affordances, agency, diverse input modalities, mental models, and advanced roles.CONCLUSIONS: This study was conducted to identify the needs of clinicians engaging with ALS-SimVR. However, our findings revealed broader design considerations that will be crucial in guiding future work in this area. Although aligning the training scenarios with accepted teaching algorithms is important, our findings reveal that improving user experience and engagement requires careful attention to technology-specific issues such as input modalities.",2020,,JMIR Serious Games,8,3,e20797,32763877,,,#8415,Moore 2020,,
The effectiveness of virtual and augmented reality in health sciences and medical anatomy,"Moro, C.; Stromberga, Z.; Raikos, A.; Stirling, A.","Although cadavers constitute the gold standard for teaching anatomy to medical and health science students, there are substantial financial, ethical, and supervisory constraints on their use. In addition, although anatomy remains one of the fundamental areas of medical education, universities have decreased the hours allocated to teaching gross anatomy in favor of applied clinical work. The release of virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices allows learning to occur through hands-on immersive experiences. The aim of this research was to assess whether learning structural anatomy utilizing VR or AR is as effective as tablet-based (TB) applications, and whether these modes allowed enhanced student learning, engagement and performance. Participants (n = 59) were randomly allocated to one of the three learning modes: VR, AR, or TB and completed a lesson on skull anatomy, after which they completed an anatomical knowledge assessment. Student perceptions of each learning mode and any adverse effects experienced were recorded. No significant differences were found between mean assessment scores in VR, AR, or TB. During the lessons however, VR participants were more likely to exhibit adverse effects such as headaches (25% in VR P < 0.05), dizziness (40% in VR, P < 0.001), or blurred vision (35% in VR, P < 0.01). Both VR and AR are as valuable for teaching anatomy as tablet devices, but also promote intrinsic benefits such as increased learner immersion and engagement. These outcomes show great promise for the effective use of virtual and augmented reality as means to supplement lesson content in anatomical education.

Urology residents experience comparable workload profiles when performing live porcine nephrectomies and robotic surgery virtual reality training modules,"Mouraviev, V.; Klein, M.; Schommer, E.; Thiel, D. D.; Samavedi, S.; Kumar, A.; Leveillee, R. J.; Thomas, R.; Pow-Sang, J. M.; Su, L. M.; Mui, E.; Smith, R.; Patel, V.","In pursuit of improving the quality of residents' education, the Southeastern Section of the American Urological Association (SES AUA) hosts an annual robotic training course for its residents. The workshop involves performing a robotic live porcine nephrectomy as well as virtual reality robotic training modules. The aim of this study was to evaluate workload levels of urology residents when performing a live porcine nephrectomy and the virtual reality robotic surgery training modules employed during this workshop. Twenty-one residents from 14 SES AUA programs participated in 2015. On the first-day residents were taught with didactic lectures by faculty. On the second day, trainees were divided into two groups. Half were asked to perform training modules of the Mimic da Vinci-Trainer (MdVT, Mimic Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) for 4 h, while the other half performed nephrectomy procedures on a live porcine model using the da Vinci Si robot (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). After the first 4 h the groups changed places for another 4-h session. All trainees were asked to complete the NASA-TLX 1-page questionnaire following both the MdVT simulation and live animal model sessions. A significant interface and TLX interaction was observed. The interface by TLX interaction was further analyzed to determine whether the scores of each of the six TLX scales varied across the two interfaces. The means of the TLX scores observed at the two interfaces were similar. The only significant difference was observed for frustration, which was significantly higher at the simulation than the animal model, t (20) = 4.12, p = 0.001. This could be due to trainees' familiarity with live anatomical structures over skill set simulations which remain a real challenge to novice surgeons. Another reason might be that the simulator provides performance metrics for specific performance traits as well as composite scores for entire exercises. Novice trainees experienced substantial mental workload while performing tasks on both the simulator and the live animal model during the robotics course. The NASA-TLX profiles demonstrated that the live animal model and the MdVT were similar in difficulty, as indicated by their comparable workload profiles.",2016,,Journal of Robotic Surgery,10,1,49-56,26753619,,,#8447,Mouraviev 2016,,
Augmented Reality System for Digital Rectal Examination Training and Assessment: System Validation,"Muangpoon, T.; Haghighi Osgouei, R.; Escobar-Castillejos, D.; Kontovounisios, C.; Bello, F.","BACKGROUND: Digital rectal examination is a difficult examination to learn and teach because of limited opportunities for practice; however, the main challenge is that students and tutors cannot see the finger when it is palpating the anal canal and prostate gland inside the patients.OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an augmented reality system to be used with benchtop models commonly available in medical schools with the aim of addressing the problem of lack of visualization. The system enables visualization of the examining finger, as well as of the internal organs when performing digital rectal examinations. Magnetic tracking sensors are used to track the movement of the finger, and a pressure sensor is used to monitor the applied pressure. By overlaying a virtual finger on the real finger and a virtual model on the benchtop model, students can see through the examination and finger maneuvers.METHODS: The system was implemented in the Unity game engine (Unity Technologies) and uses a first-generation HoloLens (Microsoft Inc) as an augmented reality device. To evaluate the system, 19 participants (9 clinicians who routinely performed digital rectal examinations and 10 medical students) were asked to use the system and answer 12 questions regarding the usefulness of the system.RESULTS: The system showed the movement of an examining finger in real time with a frame rate of 60 fps on the HoloLens and accurately aligned the virtual and real models with a mean error of 3.9 mm. Users found the movement of the finger was realistic (mean 3.9, SD 1.2); moreover, they found the visualization of the finger and internal organs were useful for teaching, learning, and assessment of digital rectal examinations (finger: mean 4.1, SD 1.1; organs: mean 4.6, SD 0.8), mainly targeting a novice group.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed augmented reality system was designed to improve teaching and learning of digital rectal examination skills by providing visualization of the finger and internal organs.

However, it is unclear whether virtual reality training can have an impact on the surgical performance of advanced laparoscopic procedures. Our objective was to assess the ability of the virtual reality simulator LAP Mentor to identify and quantify changes in surgical performance indicators, after LAP Mentor training for digestive anastomosis.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve surgeons from Centro Hospitalar de Sao Joao in Porto (Portugal) performed two sessions of advanced task 5: anastomosis in LAP Mentor, before and after completing the tutorial, and were evaluated on 34 surgical performance indicators.RESULTS: The results show that six surgical performance indicators significantly changed after LAP Mentor training. The surgeons performed the task significantly faster as the median 'total time' significantly reduced (p < 0.05) from 759.5 to 523.5 seconds. Significant decreases (p < 0.05) were also found in median 'total needle loading time' (303.3 to 107.8 seconds), 'average needle loading time' (38.5 to 31.0 seconds), 'number of passages in which the needle passed precisely through the entrance dots' (2.5 to 1.0), 'time the needle was held outside the visible field' (20.9 to 2.4 seconds), and 'total time the needle-holders' ends are kept outside the predefined operative field' (88.2 to 49.6 seconds).DISCUSSION: This study raises the possibility of using virtual reality training simulation as a benchmark tool to assess the surgical performance of Portuguese surgeons.CONCLUSION: LAP Mentor is able to identify variations in surgical performance indicators of digestive anastomosis.",2017,,Acta Medica Portuguesa,30,5,388-394,28865503,,,#8465,Muralha 2017,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of undergraduate dental students with the introduction of the Moog Simodont dental trainer (VR) within the pre-clinical curriculum in the direct restoration module of the operative dentistry course using manual and digital methods.METHODS: Thirty-two randomly selected year 2 undergraduate students were divided into two groups: group 1, exposed to the Moog Simodont dental trainer (VR) and group 2, no exposure to VR. All students were then evaluated in carrying out a Class I preparation in a single-blinded fashion. All preparations were evaluated by three assessors using a traditional manual approach and a digital software. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using chi-square test (alpha = 0.05).RESULTS: The number of students who performed satisfactory preparations was more in group 1 (12/16), compared to group 2 (7/16). The percentage of satisfactory domains was significantly higher in group 1, compared to group 2, both in the manual evaluation (83.9% (94/112) and 59.8% (67/112) in groups 1 and 2, respectively) and in the digital evaluation (85.7% (96/112) and 55.4% (62/112) in groups 1 and 2, respectively) (P < .05). There was no significant difference between the manual and digital methods of evaluation with regard to the percentage of satisfactory or unsatisfactory preparations (P > .05).CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Moog Simodont dental trainer (VR) significantly improved the satisfactory performance of students.

In this multicenter, investigator-masked, randomized clinical trial, resident surgeons within 3 months of matriculation with minimal or no prior experience with MSICS were assigned either to simulation-based training, the Experimental Group (EG), or to conventional training, the Control Group (CG). EG residents were trained to perform scleral tunnel construction using a simulation-based curriculum (HelpMeSee Eye Surgery Simulator), while residents in the CG followed institution-specific curriculum before progressing to live surgery. Surgical videos of the first 20 attempts at tunnel construction were reviewed by masked video raters. The primary outcome was the total number of any of 9 pre-specified errors. On average, the total number of errors was 9.25 (95% CI 0-18.95) in the EG and 17.56 (95% CI 6.63-28.49) in the CG (P = 0.05); the number of major errors was 4.86 (95% CI 0.13-9.59) in the EG and 10.09 (95% CI 4.76-15.41) in the CG (P = 0.02); and the number of minor errors was 4.39 (95% CI 0-9.75) in the EG and 7.47 (95% CI 1.43-13.51) in the CG (P = 0.16).

Optimal Combination of Chest Compression Depth and Rate in Virtual Reality Resuscitation Training: A Post Hoc Analysis of the Randomized Lowlands Saves Lives Trial,"Nas, J.; Thannhauser, J.; van Geuns, R. M.; van Royen, N.; Bonnes, J. L.; Brouwer, M. A.","Background Dissemination of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills is essential for cardiac arrest survival. Virtual reality (VR)-training methods are low cost and easily available, but to meet depth requirements adaptations are required, as confirmed in a recent randomized study on currently prevailing CPR quality criteria. Recently, the promising clinical performance of new CPR quality criteria was demonstrated, based on the optimal combination of compression depth and rate. We now study compliance with these newly proposed CPR quality criteria. Methods and Results Post hoc analysis of a randomized trial compared standardized 20-minute face-to-face CPR training with VR training using the Lifesaver VR smartphone application. During a posttraining test, compression depth and rate were measured using CPR mannequins. We assessed compliance with the newly proposed CPR criteria, that is, compression rate within +/-20% of 107/minute and depth within +/-20% of 47 mm. We studied 352 participants, age 26 (22-31) years, 56% female, and 15% with CPR training <=2 years. Among VR-trained participants, there was a statistically significant difference between the proportions complying with newly proposed versus the currently prevailing quality criteria (52% versus 23%, P<0.001). The difference in proportions complying with rate requirements was statistically significant (96% for the new versus 50% for current criteria, P<0.001), whereas there was no significant difference with regard to the depth requirements (55% versus 51%, P=0.45). Conclusions Lifesaver VR training, although previously found to be inferior to face-to-face training, may lead to CPR quality compliant with recently proposed, new quality criteria. If the prognostic importance of these new criteria is confirmed in additional studies, Lifesaver VR in its current form would be an easily available vector to disseminate CPR skills.",2021,,Journal of the American Heart Association,10,2,e017367,33442988,,,#8496,Nas 2021,,

Each training group performed pattern cutting trials for 12 consecutive days on their respective simulation trainers. Following a 2-week break period, the trained students performed three pattern cutting trials on each simulation platform to measure skill retention. All subjects then performed one pattern cutting task on ex vivo cadaveric peritoneal tissue. FLS and VBLaST pattern cutting scores, CUSUM scores, and transfer task completion times were reported.RESULTS: Results indicate that the FLS and VBLaST trained groups have significantly higher task performance scores than the control group in both the VBLaST and FLS environments (p < 0.05). Learning curve results indicate that three out of seven FLS training subjects and four out of six VBLaST training subjects achieved the ""senior"" performance level. Furthermore, both the FLS and VBLaST trained groups had significantly lower transfer task completion times on ex vivo peritoneal tissue models (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: We characterized task performance scores for trained VBLaST and FLS subjects via CUSUM analysis of the learning curves and showed evidence that both groups have significant improvements in surgical motor skill. Furthermore, we showed that learned surgical skills in the FLS and VBLaST environments transfer not only to the different simulation environments, but also to ex vivo tissue models.",2018,,Surgical Endoscopy,32,3,1265-1272,28812196,,,#8528,Nemani 2018,,
Educational Impact of a Pulsatile Human Cadaver Circulation Model for Endovascular Training,"Nesbitt, C. I.; Tingle, S. J.; Williams, R.; McCaslin, J. E.; Searle, R.; Mafeld, S.; Stansby, G. P.","OBJECTIVES: The face and construct validity of a novel pulsatile human cadaver model (PHCM) was recently demonstrated for endovascular training. This study aimed to assess the model's educational impact.METHODS: Twenty-four endovascular novices were recruited and split into two equal training groups: PHCM and virtual reality simulator (VRS). Each candidate performed eight consecutive training attempts of endovascular renal artery catheterisation on their designated model, and a final crossover attempt on the alternate model. Performances were video recorded and scored using a validated scoring tool by two independent endovascular experts, blinded to the candidate's identity and attempt number. Each participant was given a task specific checklist score (TSC), global rating score (GRS), and overall procedure score (OPS).RESULTS: In the PHCM group average OPS improved gradually from 19.42 (TSC 8.58, GRS 10.83) to 39.50 (TSC 15.00, GRS 24.5) over eight attempts (p < .0005). In the VRS group OPS improved from 20.54 (TSC 10.29, GRS 10.25) to 36.04 (TSC 14.21, GRS 21.88) between the first and eighth attempts (p < .0005), with limited improvement after the second attempt. PHCM training significantly improved OPS on their VRS crossover attempt (p <= .0001), achieving a similar OPS to candidates who had completed VRS training (p = .398). VRS training significantly improved OPS on PHCM (p < 0.05); however, OPS was significantly worse than candidates who had completed PHCM training (p <= .001).CONCLUSIONS: PHCM training has a longer learning curve, with gradual improvement, reflecting the enhanced difficulty of a more realistic model. These results support the use of PHCM preceded by VRS training, prior to performing endovascular surgery on patients.",2019,,European Journal of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery,58,4,602-608,31495728,,,#8534,Nesbitt 2019,,
Correlation of Virtual Reality Simulation and Dry Lab Robotic Technical Skills,"Newcomb, L. K.; Bradley, M. S.; Truong, T.; Tang, M.; Comstock, B.; Li, Y. J.; Visco, A. G.; Siddiqui, N. Y.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a set of virtual reality (VR) surgical simulation drills have correlative validity when compared with the validated Robotic Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (R-OSATS) dry lab drills.DESIGN: A prospective methods comparison study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).SETTING: A teaching hospital.PARTICIPANTS: Thirty current residents, fellows, and faculty from the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Urology, and General Surgery.INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed 5 VR drills on the da Vinci Skills Simulator and 5 dry lab drills. Participants were randomized to the order of completion.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: VR drills were scored automatically by the simulator. Dry lab drills were recorded, reviewed by 3 blinded experts, and scored using the R-OSATS assessment tool. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated comparing simulator scores and R-OSATS scores for the same surgeon. The correlation for overall summary scores between VR and dry lab drills was strong (r = 0.83; p < .01). Each of the 5 VR drills was also found to have a statistically significant correlation to its corresponding dry lab drill, with correlation coefficients ranging from r = 0.49 to 0.73 (p < .01 for all). The performance on VR drills also confirmed construct validity. Faculty and fellows had consistently higher overall scores than residents (median VR scores: 458 for faculty, 425 for fellows, 339 for residents; p < .01).CONCLUSION: We selected a core set of VR drills that reliably correlate with validated dry lab R-OSATS drills. Because dry lab drills require significant time and effort on the part of the trainees and the evaluators, this set of VR drills could serve as an ancillary method of determining trainee competence.",2018,,Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology,25,4,689-696,29154932,,,#8545,Newcomb 2018,,
Disaster Medicine: A Multi-Modality Curriculum Designed and Implemented for Emergency Medicine Residents,"Ngo, J.; Schertzer, K.; Harter, P.; Smith-Coggins, R.","OBJECTIVE: Few established curricula are available for teaching disaster medicine. We describe a comprehensive, multi-modality approach focused on simulation to teach disaster medicine to emergency medicine residents in a 3-year curriculum.METHODS: Residents underwent a 3-year disaster medicine curriculum incorporating a variety of venues, personnel, and roles. The curriculum included classroom lectures, tabletop exercises, virtual reality simulation, high-fidelity simulation, hospital disaster drills, and journal club discussion. All aspects were supervised by specialty emergency medicine faculty and followed a structured debriefing. Residents rated the high-fidelity simulations by using a 10-point Likert scale.RESULTS: Three classes of emergency medicine residents participated in the 3-year training program. Residents found the exercise to be realistic, educational, and relevant to their practice. After participating in the program, residents felt better prepared for future disasters.CONCLUSIONS: Given the large scope of impact that disasters potentiate, it is understandably difficult to teach these skills effectively. Training programs can utilize this simulation-based curriculum to better prepare the nation's emergency medicine physicians for future disasters.

Face validity of the pulsatile organ perfusion trainer for laparoscopic cholecystectomy,"Nickel, F.; Kowalewski, K. F.; Rehberger, F.; Hendrie, J. D.; Mayer, B. F.; Kenngott, H. G.; Bintintan, V.; Linke, G. R.; Fischer, L.; Muller-Stich, B. P.","BACKGROUND: The pulsatile organ perfusion (POP) trainer provides training of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with real instruments and cadaveric organs. It provides training of full procedures with simulation of bleeding. Although widely used, the face validity has not yet been evaluated. This study aimed to establish face validity of the POP trainer for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and its usefulness compared with other training modalities.MATERIALS AND METHODS: During MIS courses, the participants (n = 52) used the POP trainer to perform LC. Face validity was assessed with questionnaires for realism and usefulness on a five-point Likert scale. Participants were divided into two groups: experts (n = 15) who had performed more than 50 laparoscopic procedures and novices (n = 37) with less than 50 procedures. Secondary aims included the ranking of training modalities, as well as exploration of their specific advantages and disadvantages.RESULTS: The POP trainer was found to be realistic (3.8 +/- 0.9) and useful (4.6 +/- 0.9). Differences between experts and novices were only found for ""The training modality resembles reality"" (3.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.7; p = 0.010), ""The operation on the POP trainer is realistic"" (3.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.8; p = 0.003), and ""It would be desirable to have a POP trainer at my own hospital"" (4.2 +/- 1.1 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.8; p = 0.040). In the ranking, the animal training (1.1 +/- 0.3) placed first, the POP trainer (2.3 +/- 0.9) second, and the VR trainer (2.8 +/- 0.9) and box trainer (2.8 +/- 1.1) third. The realistic simulation of animal training was named as an advantage most often, while the unrealistic simulation of the VR trainer was the most often named disadvantage.CONCLUSIONS: The POP trainer was rated a highly realistic and useful training modality with face validity for LC. Differences between experts and novices existed concerning realism and desirability. Future studies should evaluate the POP trainer for more advanced surgical procedures. The POP trainer widens the spectrum of modalities for training of MIS in a safe environment outside the operating room.",2017,,Surgical Endoscopy,31,2,714-722,27317031,,,#8559,Nickel 2017,,
Is there a place for virtual reality simulators in assessment of competency in percutaneous renal access?,"Noureldin, Y. A.; Fahmy, N.; Anidjar, M.; Andonian, S.","OBJECTIVE: To assess competency of urology post-graduate trainees (PGTs) in percutaneous renal access (PCA).METHODS: Upon obtaining ethics approval and informed consents, PGTs between post-graduate years (PGY-3 to PGY-5) from all four urology programs in Quebec were recruited. PCA competency of each participant was assessed objectively by performing task 4 on the PERC Mentor TM simulator, where they had to correctly access and pop 7 balloons in 7 different renal calyces and subjectively by the validated Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy-Global Rating Scale (PCNL-GRS).RESULTS: A total of 26 PGTs with a mean age of 29.2 +/- 0.7 years participated in this study. When compared with the 21 PGTs without practice, all 5 PGTs who had practiced on the simulator were competent (p = 0.03), performed the task with significantly shorter operative time (13.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.4 min; p < 0.001) and fluoroscopy time (9.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.4 min; p < 0.001), and had significantly higher PCNL-GRS scores (13 +/- 0.6 vs. 20.6 +/- 1; p < 0.001) and successful attempts to access renal calyces (23 +/- 5 vs. 68.7 +/- 11; p = 0.001).

This new immersive video type may be of particular usefulness in procedure-based healthcare settings. We hypothesized that VR echocardiography was non-inferior to live demonstration. Our aim was to assess the usefulness of a VR echocardiographic approach in teaching echocardiography to pediatric trainees compared to live demonstration. This was a single center, cross-sectional observational design. We used a Garmin VIRB R 360 and a head-mount display to record live echocardiography exams in a pediatric population. An Oculus Go TM was used to view the 360degree immersive/VR videos. Trainees responded to a written questionnaire afterwards. Fifteen trainees participated in the study, each of whom had previously seen echocardiography through live demonstration teaching. Eleven respondents had previous hands-on echocardiography experience. All 15 participants confirmed that VR echocardiography is a useful teaching tool with 87% (n = 13) rating it as good or very good on a 5-point Likert scale. When asked to compare VR to live demonstration, 67% (n = 10) rated VR echocardiography as the same or better than live demonstration.

Although studies exist to assess the ability of the simulator to differentiate between novices and experienced endoscopists, it is not well understood how simulators can differentiate skills among resident cohort. <b>Objective</b> To assess the utility of the VR simulator, we evaluated the correlation between resident endoscopy experience and performance on two VR simulator colonoscopy modules on the GI-BRONCH Mentor (Simbionix Ltd, Airport City, Israel). <b>Methods</b> Postgraduate years 2 to 5 residents completed ""easy"" and ""difficult"" VR colonoscopies, and performance metrics were recorded from October 2017 to February 2018 at Rutgers' two general surgery residency programs. Resident endoscopy experience was obtained through Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case logs. Correlations between resident endoscopy experience and VR colonoscopy performance metrics were assessed using Spearman's rho (rho) correlation statistic and bivariate logistic regression. <b>Results</b> Fifty-five residents out of 65 (84.6%) eligible participants completed the study. There were limited correlations found between resident endoscopy experience and FES performance metrics and no correlations were found between resident endoscopy experience and binary metrics of colonoscopy-ability to complete colonoscopy, ability to retroflex, and withdrawal time of less than 6 minutes. <b>Conclusion</b> The VR simulator may have a limited ability to discriminate between experience levels among resident cohort.

R.","OBJECTIVES: To provide a systematic overview of the literature assessing the value of haptic and force feedback in current simulators teaching laparoscopic surgical skills.DATA SOURCES: The databases of Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched to retrieve relevant studies published until January 31st, 2017. The search included laparoscopic surgery, simulation, and haptic or force feedback and all relevant synonyms.METHODS: Duplicates were removed, and titles and abstracts screened. The remaining articles were subsequently screened full text and included in this review if they followed the inclusion criteria. A total of 2 types of feedback have been analyzed and will be discussed separately: haptic- and force feedback.RESULTS: A total of 4023 articles were found, of which 87 could be used in this review. A descriptive analysis of the data is provided. Results of the added value of haptic interface devices in virtual reality are variable. Haptic feedback is most important for more complex tasks. The interface devices do not require the highest level of fidelity. Haptic feedback leads to a shorter learning curve with a steadier upward trend. Concerning force feedback, force parameters are measured through force sensing systems in the instrument and/or the environment. These parameters, especially in combination with motion parameters, provide box trainers with an objective evaluation of laparoscopic skills. Feedback of force-use both real time and postpractice has been shown to improve training.CONCLUSIONS: Haptic feedback is added to virtual reality simulators to increase the fidelity and thereby improve training effect. Variable results have been found from adding haptic feedback. It is most important for more complex tasks, but results in only minor improvements for novice surgeons. Force parameters and force feedback in box trainers have been shown to improve training results.",2019,,Journal of Surgical Education,76,1,242-261,30082239,,,#8652,Overtoom 2019,,
Using Immersive Technologies to Develop Medical Education Materials,"Ovunc, S. S.; Yolcu, M.

The evaluation of surgical education has continued to benefit from the wisdom of the past by harnessing technologies. Rapidly changing and improving the nature of the surgery fostered that evaluation and enforced the institutions to find new solutions for surgical education. In the present descriptive technical report, our aim was threefold: (1) to share acquired educational materials based on immersive technologies involving 3D-printing, Augmented Reality (AR), and 360-degree video recording to improve ongoing pediatric surgery student training at our faculty, (2) to describe workflow underlying the construction of the materials, and (3) to provide approaches that may help other students and lecturers to develop their educational materials. The educational materials, including 3D-printed models, AR hybrid student book, a hydrogel-based simulation model of the kidney, and Mirror World Simulation, were constructed. The authors, who are medical students, led the construction of the educational materials, so the educational materials were shaped by a collaboration between students and pediatric surgeons. The materials constructed enabled the students to practice surgical procedures and experience different surgical environments. We believe these educational materials can serve as a valuable resource for training in many medical specialties in the future.

Training on real patients carries drawbacks such as limited access and elevated risk. Alternatively, surgical simulation allows residents to practice in a safe environment with greater access to standardized surgical tasks. Virtual reality simulators display images inside an artificial joint, often providing real-time haptic feedback to allow for realistic interaction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the construct validity of a virtual reality simulator for knee arthroscopy by analyzing the capacity of system parameters to distinguish between expert and novice surgeons. Design This comparative cross-sectional study contrasts the automated performance reports for novice and expert orthopedic surgeons after executing surgical tasks on the ARTHRO Mentor virtual reality simulator. Setting Surgical simulation center at the University of Chile Clinical Hospital, Santiago, Chile. Participants The novice group consisted of 20 second-year orthopedic and traumatology residents at the University of Chile School of Medicine. The expert group consisted of 10 experienced arthroscopic surgeons. All participants carried out standardized tasks in the knee arthroscopy virtual reality simulator. The median performance scores of the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the capacity of the system to discriminate between the two groups. Results Median performance on the vast majority of surgical tasks was superior for the expert group.

This study explores the extent to which portable Immersive Virtual Reality technology can help us gain an accurate understanding of the factors that influence a doctor's response to the ethical challenge underlying such tenacious requests for antibiotics (given the threat posed by growing anti-bacterial resistance worldwide). It also considers the potential of such technology to train doctors to face such dilemmas.EXPERIMENT: Twelve experienced GPs and nine trainees were confronted with an increasingly angry demand by a woman to prescribe antibiotics to her mother in the face of inconclusive evidence that such antibiotic prescription is necessary. The daughter and mother were virtual characters displayed in immersive virtual reality. The specific purposes of the study were twofold: first, whether experienced GPs would be more resistant to patient demands than the trainees, and second, to investigate whether medical doctors would take the virtual situation seriously.RESULTS: Eight out of the 9 trainees prescribed the antibiotics, whereas 7 out of the 12 GPs did so. On the basis of a Bayesian analysis, these results yield reasonable statistical evidence in favor of the notion that experienced GPs are more likely to withstand the pressure to prescribe antibiotics than trainee doctors, thus answering our first question positively. As for the second question, a post experience questionnaire assessing the participants' level of presence (together with participants' feedback and body language) suggested that overall participants did tend towards the illusion of being in the consultation room depicted in the virtual reality and that the virtual consultation taking place was really happening.",2016,,PLoS ONE [Electronic Resource],11,2,e0146837,26889676,,,#8678,Pan 2016,,
Creating a low-cost virtual reality surgical simulation to increase surgical oncology capacity and capability,"Parham, G.; Bing, E. G.; Cuevas, A.; Fisher, B.; Skinner, J.; Mwanahamuntu, M.; Sullivan, R.","Worldwide, more than 80% of people with cancer will require surgery during their disease course, but less than 25% have access to safe, affordable and timely surgery. Among the barriers to increasing surgical capacity are the time and costs required to train novices. Virtual reality (VR) surgical simulations can reduce the time required for novices to reach surgical proficiency, though their costs may exceed USD $100,000. The goal of this study was to determine if a low-cost system, using commercially available technology designed for in-home computer gaming, could be used to create a realistic VR surgical oncology simulation. Standard commercially available VR software and Oculus Rift hardware have been used to provide high-quality visuals and believable surgeon hand interactions. Near identical VR reproduction of an operating room using 1:1 scale matching of real-world elements, including equipment, instruments, supplies and sounds, maintaining frame rate greater than 60 fps to maintain visual fidelity has been created. Internal anatomy was designed as VR replica of human female pelvic anatomy, including organs, veins and other vessels, peritoneum and connective tissue. Internal anatomy was designed to run at 120 fps and to allow for a realistic abdominal radical hysterectomy simulation. Surgical hands were modelled to scale for those with large and small hands. Multiple hand positions were simulated using Oculus touch hardware. Reconstructing the virtual environment to simulate reality as accurately as possible was done to immerse users in the simulator so that they focus on learning and practise without distractions. Training modules were co-designed by experts in learning sciences, human behaviour, VR and gynaecologic oncology. We have successfully created a low-cost VR simulation to help prepare novice surgeons to perform a radical abdominal hysterectomy surgery procedure. The simulation can be used with commercially available computer gaming hardware that currently costs less than USD $1,500. Low-cost VR simulation has the potential to reduce the time and cost to train surgeons to perform surgical oncology procedures, as well as both improve and audit quality.

Of the 866 records screened, 27 were included in the analysis. These were assessed for face, content and construct validity, as well as their attempt to measure educational impact.RESULTS: Simulation models were identified comprising of animal tissues, synthetic materials and virtual reality (VR) technology. Models were designed for instruction in repair of inguinal, umbilical, incisional and diaphragmatic hernias. Twenty-one laparoscopic hernia repair models were described. Many models demonstrated validity across several domains, and three showed transferability of skills from simulation to the operating room. Of the six open hernia repair simulation models, none were found to have demonstrated an educational impact in addition to assessing validity.CONCLUSION: Few models individually were able to demonstrate validity and educational impact.

Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice in Virtual Reality: Teaching Transvenous Pacemaker Insertion to Emergency Medicine Residents,"Peng, C.; Ng, K. M.; Roszczynialski, K. N.; Warrington, S. J.; Schertzer, K.","Introduction Transvenous pacemaker insertion is a critical life-saving procedure that is infrequently performed. Traditional mannequin-based training paradigms are resource intensive and sometimes inadequate due to time constraints. Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice (RCDP) is an effective teaching modality for highly scripted procedures. We propose using a simulation-based technique of RCDP in virtual reality (VR) to teach this procedure. Methods Sixteen emergency medicine residents were recruited. A pre-survey was administered at the start of the session, followed by a baseline task trainer checklist-based assessment. This checklist was created based on expert consensus. Participants then underwent the RCDP VR intervention with a subsequent repeat checklist-based assessment as well as a post-survey. Results Post-test scores were found to be significantly higher than pre-test scores after residents completed VR deliberate practice simulation (19.5+/-3.5 vs 24.1+/-2.0; p<0.001). Subanalysis did not reveal any significant difference based on post-graduate year, previous performance of procedure on a live patient, or previous VR experience. The experience increased participant feelings of preparedness and comfort in performing the procedure (2-disagree vs 4-agree) based on a 5-point Likert scale. Conclusions Virtual reality using RCDP to teach transvenous pacemaker insertion demonstrated an improvement in task trainer performance. Further investigation into whether this translates into better patient outcomes or can be generalized to other procedures needs to be considered.",2021,,Cureus,13,10,e18503,34754663,,,#8758,Peng 2021,,

We conducted a study involving 92 residents and attending neurosurgeons from different European Centres; each participant had to perform a virtual task, namely the placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD) at a neurosurgical simulator (ImmersiveTouch). The number of attempts needed to reach the ventricles and the accuracy in positioning the catheter were assessed.RESULTS: Data suggests a positive correlation between subjects who placed more EVDs in the previous year and those who get better scores at the simulator (p = .008) (fewer attempts and better surgical accuracy). The number of attempts to reach the ventricle was also analysed; senior residents needed fewer attempts (mean = 2.26; SD = 1.11) than junior residents (mean = 3.12; SD = 1.05) (p = .007) and staff neurosurgeons (mean = 2.89, SD = 1.23). Scoring results were compared by using the Fisher's test, for the analysis of the variances, and the Student's T test. Surprisingly, having a wider surgical experience overall does not correlate with the best performance at the simulator.CONCLUSION: The performance of an EVD placement on a simulator correlates with the density of the neurosurgical experience for that specific task performed in the OR, suggesting that simulators are able to differentiate neurosurgeons according to their surgical ability. Namely this suggests that the simulation performance reflects the surgeons' consistency in placing EVDs in the last year.",2018,,Acta Neurochirurgica,160,11,2087-2097,30276545,,,#8772,Perin 2018,,
Resuscitating Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training in a Virtual Reality: Prospective Interventional Study,"Perron, J. E.; Coffey, M. J.; Lovell-Simons, A.; Dominguez, L.; King, M. E.; Ooi, C. Y.","BACKGROUND: Simulation-based technologies are emerging to enhance medical education in the digital era. However, there is limited data for the use of virtual reality simulation in pediatric medical education. We developed Virtual Doc as a highly immersive virtual reality simulation to teach pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills to medical students.OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate participant satisfaction and perceived educational efficacy of Virtual Doc. The secondary aim of this study was to assess the game play features of Virtual Doc.METHODS: We conducted a prospective closed beta-testing study at the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) in 2018. All medical students from the 6-year undergraduate program were eligible to participate and were recruited through voluntary convenience sampling. Participants attended a 1-hour testing session and attempted at least one full resuscitation case using the virtual reality simulator. Following this, participants were asked to complete an anonymous postsession questionnaire. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics.RESULTS: A total of 26 participants were recruited, consented to participate in this study, and attended a 1-hour in-person closed beta-testing session, and 88% (23/26) of participants completed the anonymous questionnaire and were included in this study. Regarding participant satisfaction, Virtual Doc was enjoyed by 91% (21/23) of participants, with 74% (17/23) intending to recommend the simulation to a colleague and 66% (15/23) intending to recommend the simulation to a friend. In assessment of the perceived educational value of Virtual Doc, 70% (16/23) of participants agreed they had an improved understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 78% (18/23) agreed that Virtual Doc will help prepare for and deal with real-life clinical scenarios. Furthermore, 91% (21/23) of participants agreed with the development of additional Virtual Doc cases as beneficial for learning. An evaluation of the game play features as our secondary objective revealed that 70% (16/23) of participants agreed with ease in understanding how to use Virtual Doc, and 74% (17/23) found the game play elements useful in understanding cardiopulmonary resuscitation. One-third (7/23, 30%) found it easy to work with the interactive elements. In addition, 74% (17/23) were interested in interacting with other students within the simulation.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a positive response regarding trainee satisfaction and perceived educational efficacy of Virtual Doc. The simulation was widely accepted by the majority of users and may have the potential to improve educational learning objectives.",2021,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,23,7,e22920,34326040,,,#8775,Perron 2021,,
Pretraining of basic skills on a virtual reality vitreoretinal simulator: A waste of time,"Petersen, S. B.; Vestergaard, A. H.; Thomsen, A. S. S.; Konge, L.; Cour, M.; Grauslund, J.; Vergmann, A. S.","PURPOSE: To investigate whether pretraining of basic skills in virtual vitreoretinal surgery affected the performance curve when proceeding to procedure-specific modules.METHODS: This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled, two-centre study. Medical students were randomized into two groups: Group 1 pretrained basic psycho-motor skills (Navigation Training level 2 and Bimanual Training level 3) until they reached their performance curve plateau. Hereafter, both groups trained on the procedure-specific modules (Posterior Hyaloid level 3 and ILM Peeling level 3) until they reached their performance curve plateau. Plateau was defined as three consecutive sessions with the same score with an acceptable variation. The primary outcome was time used to reach performance curve plateau in the procedure-specific modules.RESULTS: A total of 68 medical students were included, and equally randomized into two groups. The participants in Group 1 used a median time of 88 minutes to reach plateau in the basic skills modules but did not differ from Group 2 in time to reach plateau on the procedure-specific modules (183 min versus 210 min, p = 0.40) or in the amplitude of plateau. Group 1 and 2 differed significantly in the starting score of ILM peeling level 3 (0 (0-0) versus 3.5 (0-75), p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: We were not able to show positive skill transfer from basic skills training to the procedure-specific modules in time, starting score or amplitude of plateau. Thus, we recommend that aspiring vitreoretinal surgeons proceed directly to simulation-based training of procedures instead of spending valuable training time on basic skills training.",2022,,Acta Opthalmologica,100,5,e1074-e1079,34609052,,,#8782,Petersen 2022,,
Using 360-degree video for teaching emergency medicine during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic,"Petrica, A.; Lungeanu, D.; Ciuta, A.; Marza, A. M.; Botea, M. O.; Mederle, O. A.","OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency medicine (EM) teachers had to employ innovative methods to ensure the continuity of the education process. The purpose of this study was to explore the adequacy of the 360-degree video (video 360) technology in EM education in the context of: (a) students' attitudes towards the video 360; (b) students' academic performance in their required examination at the end of the EM course compared to the assessment results of students from the previous academic year.METHODS: A mixed-method research project enrolled the fourth-year medical students who attended the required EM course during the first semester of the academic year 2020-2021 when all activities with undergraduate students went online and teaching scenarios recorded in the video 360 format were employed. Data collection was two-fold: (a) anonymous questionnaires, complemented with basic YouTube analytics; (b) multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQ) and oral examination, contrasting the results with those in 2019-2020. Data analysis used descriptive statistics and non-parametric methods.RESULTS: Seventy-nine students (53 females and 26 males) participated in the project and all completed the EM course. Students' interest in and their acceptance of the video 360 technology were high (total scoring in the upper 20% of the respective scales), with consistently good performance in two parallel, independent, interview-based oral/practical evaluations (Spearman correlation coefficient R = 0.665, p < .001). The majority scored over 90% in the summative MCQ, with higher values compared to their colleagues' during the previous academic year (with on-site teaching): scoring percentages with mean +/- standard deviation of 92.52 +/- 4.57 and 76.67 +/- 18.77, respectively.CONCLUSION: Our project showed that the video 360 scenarios were effective in teaching EM. In the long term, employing this accessible and inexpensive educational approach would add value to on-site training by enriching the exposure to a specific ED environment.KEY MESSAGESMedical students valued the 360-degree video scenarios as contributing substantially to their EM knowledge and preparedness.Examination results confirmed the 360-degree video scenarios as viable in EM teaching. The 360-degree video technology would be a sustainable solution for hybrid medical teaching in the long term.",2021,,Annals of Medicine,53,1,1520-1530,34612105,,,#8785,Petrica 2021,,
Virtual-Augmented Reality and Life-Like Neurosurgical Simulator for Training: First Evaluation of a Hands-On Experience for Residents,"Petrone, S.; Cofano, F.; Nicolosi, F.; Spena, G.; Moschino, M.; Di Perna, G.; Lavorato, A.; Lanotte, M. M.; Garbossa, D.","Background: In the recent years, growing interest in simulation-based surgical education has led to various practical alternatives for medical training. More recently, courses based on virtual reality (VR) and three-dimensional (3D)-printed models are available. In this paper, a hybrid (virtual and physical) neurosurgical simulator has been validated, equipped with augmented reality (AR) capabilities that can be used repeatedly to increase familiarity and improve the technical skills in human brain anatomy and neurosurgical approaches.Methods: The neurosurgical simulator used in this study (UpSurgeOn Box, UpSurgeOn Srl, Assago, Milan) combines a virtual component and a physical component with an intermediate step to provide a hybrid solution. A first reported and evaluated practical experience on the anatomical 3D-printed model has been conducted with a total of 30 residents in neurosurgery. The residents had the possibility to choose a specific approach, focus on the correct patient positioning, and go over the chosen approach step-by-step, interacting with the model through AR application. Next, each practical surgical step on the 3D model was timed and qualitatively evaluated by 3 senior neurosurgeons. Quality and usability-grade surveys were filled out by participants.Results: More than 89% of the residents assessed that the application and the AR simulator were very helpful in improving the orientation skills during neurosurgical approaches. Indeed, 89.3% of participants found brain and skull anatomy highly realistic during their tasks. Moreover, workshop exercises were considered useful in increasing the competency and technical skills required in the operating room by 85.8 and 84.7% of residents, respectively. Data collected confirmed that the anatomical model and its application were intuitive, well-integrated, and easy to use.Conclusion: The hybrid AR and 3D-printed neurosurgical simulator could be a valid tool for neurosurgical training, capable of enhancing personal technical skills and competence. In addition, it could be easy to imagine how patient safety would increase and healthcare costs would be reduced, even if more studies are needed to investigate these aspects. The integration of simulators for training in neurosurgery as preparatory steps for the operating room should be recommended and further investigated given their huge potential.",2022,,Frontiers in Surgery,9,,862948,35662818,,,#8786,Petrone 2022,,
Technical and Nontechnical Skills in Surgery: A Simulated Operating Room Environment Study,"Pfandler, M.; Stefan, P.; Mehren, C.; Lazarovici, M.; Weigl, M.","STUDY DESIGN: Observational simulation study.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between technical and nontechnical skills (NTS) in a simulated surgical procedure.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although surgeons' technical and NTS during surgery are crucial determinants for clinical outcomes, little literature is available in spine surgery. Moreover, evidence regarding how surgeons' technical and NTS are related is limited.METHODS: A mixed-reality and full-scale simulated operating room environment was employed for the surgical team. Eleven surgeons performed the vertebroplasty procedure (VP). Technical skills (TS) were assessed using Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill scores and senior expert-evaluated VP outcome assessment. NTS were assessed with the Observational Teamwork Assessment for Surgery. Kendall-Tau-b tests were performed for correlations. We further controlled the influence of surgeons' experience (based on professional tenure and number of previous VPs performed).RESULT: Surgeons' NTS correlated significantly with their technical performance (tau = 0.63; P = 0.006) and surgical outcome scores (tau = 0.60; P = 0.007). This association was attenuated when controlling for surgeons' experience.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that spine surgeons with higher levels of TS also apply better communication, leadership, and coordination behaviors during the procedure. Yet, the role of surgeons' experience needs further investigation for improving surgeons' intraoperative performance during spine surgery.Level of evidence: 3.",2019,,Spine,44,23,E1396-E1400,31725688,,,#8791,Pfandler 2019,,
Assessing the difference in learning gain between a mixed reality application and drawing screencasts in neuroanatomy,"Pickering, J. D.; Panagiotis, A.; Ntakakis, G.; Athanassiou, A.; Babatsikos, E.; Bamidis, P. D.","Augmented, mixed, and virtual reality applications and content have surged into the higher education arena, thereby allowing institutions to engage in research and development projects to better understand their efficacy within curricula. However, despite the increasing interest, there remains a lack of robust empirical evidence to justify the mainstream acceptance of this approach as an effective and efficient learning tool. In this study, the impact of a mixed reality application focused on long spinal cord sensory and motor pathways is explored in comparison to an existing resource already embedded within an active curriculum (e.g., anatomy drawing screencasts). To assess the changes in learner gain, a quasi-randomized control trial with a pre- and post-test methodology was used on a cohort of Year 2 medical students, with both the absolute and normalized gain calculated. Similar patterns of learner gain were observed between the two groups; only the multiple-choice questionnaires were shown to be answered significantly higher with the screencast group. This study adds important empirical data to the emerging field of immersive technologies and the specific impact on short-term knowledge gain for neuroanatomy teaching, specifically that of long sensory and motor pathways. Despite the limitations of the study, it provides important additional data to the field and intends to support colleagues across the education landscape in making evidence-informed decisions about the value of including such resources into their curricula.",2022,,Anatomical sciences education,15,3,628-635,34157219,,,#8802,Pickering 2022,,

While nurses are often at the frontline of mental health care, they have limited access to dedicated psychiatric training opportunities. Simulation training may foster the development of the appropriate competencies required when supporting people with mental disorders. To evaluate the effectiveness of simulation training in psychiatry for nursing students, nurses and nurse practitioners.DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.DATA SOURCES: Eight electronic databases, trial registries, key journals and reference lists of selected studies were searched from inception to August 20, 2020 without language restriction.REVIEW METHODS: We included randomized and non-randomized controlled studies and single group pre/post studies. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0 was used for randomized controlled study appraisal, and the Medical Education Research Study Quality instrument was completed for all other studies. Meta-analysis was restricted to randomized controlled studies. The other studies were synthesized narratively. The main outcomes were based on Kirkpatrick levels.RESULTS: A total of 118 studies (6738 participants) were found. Interventions included simulated patients (n = 55), role-plays (n = 40), virtual reality (n = 12), manikins (n = 9) and voice simulations (n = 9). Meta-analyses based on 11 randomized controlled studies found a significant large effect size on skills at immediate post-test for simulation compared with active control; and a small and medium effect size on learners' attitudes for simulation compared with inactive control, at immediate post-test and at three-month follow-up respectively. Three quarters of non-randomized controlled studies and pre/post-tests assessing attitudes and skills showed significant differences, and three quarters of participants in randomized controlled studies and pre/post-tests showed significant differences in behaviours. Among the few studies assessing people with mental health outcomes, almost all reported significant differences.CONCLUSION: These findings support the effectiveness of simulation training in psychiatric nursing throughout professional development grades, despite heterogeneity in methods and simulation interventions.",2022,,Journal of advanced nursing,78,2,332-347,34378236,,,#8812,Piot 2022,,
On the Use of Virtual Reality for Medical Imaging Visualization,"Pires, F.; Costa, C.; Dias, P.","Advanced visualization of medical imaging has been a motive for research due to its value for disease analysis, surgical planning, and academical training. More recently, attention has been turning toward mixed reality as a means to deliver more interactive and realistic medical experiences. However, there are still many limitations to the use of virtual reality for specific scenarios. Our intent is to study the current usage of this technology and assess the potential of related development tools for clinical contexts. This paper focuses on virtual reality as an alternative to today's majority of slice-based medical analysis workstations, bringing more immersive three-dimensional experiences that could help in cross-slice analysis. We determine the key features a virtual reality software should support and present today's software tools and frameworks for researchers that intend to work on immersive medical imaging visualization. Such solutions are assessed to understand their ability to address existing challenges of the field. It was understood that most development frameworks rely on well-established toolkits specialized for healthcare and standard data formats such as DICOM. Also, game engines prove to be adequate means of combining software modules for improved results. Virtual reality seems to remain a promising technology for medical analysis but has not yet achieved its true potential. Our results suggest that prerequisites such as real-time performance and minimum latency pose the greatest limitations for clinical adoption and need to be addressed. There is also a need for further research comparing mixed realities and currently used technologies.",2021,,Journal of digital imaging,34,4,1034-1048,34327628,,,#8813,Pires 2021,,

Computerized Virtual Reality Simulation in Preclinical Dentistry: Can a Computerized Simulator Replace the Conventional Phantom Heads and Human Instruction?,"Plessas, A.","STATEMENT: In preclinical dental education, the acquisition of clinical, technical skills, and the transfer of these skills to the clinic are paramount. Phantom heads provide an efficient way to teach preclinical students dental procedures safely while increasing their dexterity skills considerably. Modern computerized phantom head training units incorporate features of virtual reality technology and the ability to offer concurrent augmented feedback. The aims of this review were to examine and evaluate the dental literature for evidence supporting their use and to discuss the role of augmented feedback versus the facilitator's instruction. Adjunctive training in these units seems to enhance student's learning and skill acquisition and reduce the required faculty supervision time. However, the virtual augmented feedback cannot be used as the sole method of feedback, and the facilitator's input is still critical. Well-powered longitudinal randomized trials exploring the impact of these units on student's clinical performance and issues of cost-effectiveness are warranted.",2017,,Simulation in Healthcare: The Journal of The Society for Medical Simulation,12,5,332-338,28697057,,,#8827,Plessas 2017,,
"DICOM 3D viewers, virtual reality or 3D printing - a pilot usability study for assessing the preference of orthopedic surgeons","Popescu, D.; Marinescu, R.; Laptoiu, D.; Deac, G. C.; Cotet, C. E.","As standard practice in orthopedic surgery, the information gathered by analyzing Computer Tomography (CT) 2D images is used for patient diagnosis and planning surgery. Lately, these virtual slices are the input for generating 3D virtual models using DICOM viewers, facilitating spatial orientation, and diagnosis. Virtual Reality (VR) and 3D printing (3DP) technologies are also reported for use in anatomy visualization, medical training, and diagnosis. However, it has not been yet investigated whether the surgeons consider that the advantages offered by 3DP and VR outweigh their development efforts. Moreover, no comparative evaluation for understanding surgeon's preference in using these investigation tools has been performed so far. Therefore, in this paper, a pilot usability test was conducted for collecting surgeons' opinions. 3D models of knee, hip and foot were displayed using DICOM 3D viewer, two VR environments and as 3D-printed replicas. These tools adequacy for diagnosis was comparatively assessed in three cases scenarios, the time for completing the diagnosis tasks was recorded and questionnaires filled in. The time for preparing the models for VR and 3DP, the resources needed and the associated costs were presented in order to provide surgeons with the whole context. Results showed a preference in using desktop DICOM viewer with 3D capabilities along with the information provided by Unity-based VR solution for visualizing the virtual model from various angles challenging to analyze on the computer screen. 3D-printed replicas were considered more useful for physically simulating the surgery than for diagnosis. For the VR and 3DP models, the lack of information on bone quality was considered an important drawback. The following order of using the tools was preferred: DICOM viewer, followed by Unity VR and 3DP.",2021,,Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Challenges for surgical training have been addressed by the use of virtual reality (VR) simulators. To date, a number of simulators have been developed. However, previous studies regarding their training effects investigated only medically pretrained subjects or the time course of training outcomes has not been reported.METHODS: A computer tomography (CT) dataset was segmented manually. A three-dimensional polygonal surface model was generated and textured using original photographic material. Interaction with the virtual environment was performed using a haptic input device. For the investigation of training outcomes with the simulator, the parameters duration and the number of errors were recorded. Ten subjects completed a training consisting of five runs on ten consecutive days.RESULTS: Within the whole exercise period, four subjects reduced the duration of intervention by more than 60%. Four subjects reduced the number of errors by more than 60%. Eight out of 10 subjects showed an improvement with respect to both parameters. On median, the duration of the procedure was reduced by 46 seconds and the number of errors by 191.

Early studies suggest a growing role for VR applications in pain management, clinical skills training, cognitive assessment and cognitive therapy, and physical rehabilitation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: To complete a review of the literature, we searched PubMed and MEDLINE databases with the following search terms: ""virtual reality,"" ""procedural medicine,"" ""oncology,"" ""physical therapy,"" and ""burn."" We further limited our search to publications in the English language. Boolean operators were used to combine search terms.RESULTS: The included search terms yielded 97 potential articles, of which 45 were identified as meeting study criteria, and are included in this review. These articles provide data, which strongly support the hypothesis that VR simulations can enhance pain management (by reducing patient perception of pain and anxiety), can augment clinical training curricula and physical rehabilitation protocols (through immersive audiovisual environments), and can improve clinical assessment of cognitive function (through improved ecological validity).CONCLUSION: Through computer-generated, life-like digital landscapes, VR stands to change the current approach to pain management, medical training, neurocognitive diagnosis, and physical rehabilitation.

Objective Assessment of Laparoscopic Force and Psychomotor Skills in a Novel Virtual Reality-Based Haptic Simulator,"Prasad, M. S.; Manivannan, M.; Manoharan, G.; Chandramohan, S. M.","BACKGROUND: Most of the commercially available virtual reality-based laparoscopic simulators do not effectively evaluate combined psychomotor and force-based laparoscopic skills. Consequently, the lack of training on these critical skills leads to intraoperative errors.OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of the novel virtual reality-based simulator, this study analyzed the combined psychomotor (i.e., motion or movement) and force skills of residents and expert surgeons. The study also examined the effectiveness of real-time visual force feedback and tool motion during training.DESIGN: Bimanual fundamental (i.e., probing, pulling, sweeping, grasping, and twisting) and complex tasks (i.e., tissue dissection) were evaluated. In both tasks, visual feedback on applied force and tool motion were provided. The skills of the participants while performing the early tasks were assessed with and without visual feedback. Participants performed 5 repetitions of fundamental and complex tasks. Reaction force and instrument acceleration were used as metrics.SETTING: Surgical Gastroenterology, Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital; Institute of Surgical Gastroenterology, Madras Medical College and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.PARTICIPANTS: Residents (N = 25; postgraduates and surgeons with <2 years of laparoscopic surgery) and expert surgeons (N = 25; surgeons with >4 and <=10 years of laparoscopic surgery).RESULTS: Residents applied large forces compared with expert surgeons and performed abrupt tool movements (p < 0.001). However, visual + haptic feedback improved the performance of residents (p < 0.001). In complex tasks, visual + haptic feedback did not influence the applied force of expert surgeons, but influenced their tool motion (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in complex tissue sweeping task, expert surgeons applied more force, but were within the tissue damage limits. In both groups, exertion of large forces and abrupt tool motion were observed during grasping, probing or pulling, and tissue sweeping maneuvers (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Modern day curriculum-based training should evaluate the skills of residents with robust force and psychomotor-based exercises for proficient laparoscopy.

C.; Prescher, A.; Holzle, F.; Kuhlen, T. W.; Modabber, A.","BACKGROUND: Although nearly one-third of the world's disease burden requires surgical care, only a small proportion of digital health applications are directly used in the surgical field. In the coming decades, the application of augmented reality (AR) with a new generation of optical-see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) like the HoloLens (Microsoft Corp) has the potential to bring digital health into the surgical field. However, for the application to be performed on a living person, proof of performance must first be provided due to regulatory requirements. In this regard, cadaver studies could provide initial evidence.OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to develop an open-source system for AR-based surgery on human cadavers using freely available technologies.METHODS: We tested our system using an easy-to-understand scenario in which fractured zygomatic arches of the face had to be repositioned with visual and auditory feedback to the investigators using a HoloLens. Results were verified with postoperative imaging and assessed in a blinded fashion by 2 investigators. The developed system and scenario were qualitatively evaluated by consensus interview and individual questionnaires.RESULTS: The development and implementation of our system was feasible and could be realized in the course of a cadaver study. The AR system was found helpful by the investigators for spatial perception in addition to the combination of visual as well as auditory feedback. The surgical end point could be determined metrically as well as by assessment.CONCLUSIONS: The development and application of an AR-based surgical system using freely available technologies to perform OST-HMD-guided surgical procedures in cadavers is feasible. Cadaver studies are suitable for OST-HMD-guided interventions to measure a surgical end point and provide an initial data foundation for future clinical trials. The availability of free systems for researchers could be helpful for a possible translation process from digital health to AR-based surgery using OST-HMDs in the operating theater via cadaver studies.",2022,,JMIR Serious Games,10,2,e34781,35468090,,,#8864,Puladi 2022,,
Virtual reality simulation for critical pediatric airway management training,"Putnam, E. M.; Rochlen, L. R.; Alderink, E.; Auge, J.; Popov, V.; Levine, R.; Tait, A. R.","BACKGROUND: Pediatric airway emergencies are relatively rare, but have potentially devastating consequences. Simulation based education is important in providing zero-risk management experience for these critical events.AIMS: The aim of the study was to assess usability and feasibility of combined interactive instructional videos and a novel Virtual Reality (VR) trainer for healthcare professionals and to evaluate the impact of this combination on learners' knowledge of critical airway events in children.METHODS: The study population included medical students, residents, faculty, and advanced practice nurses. Participants completed a short baseline knowledge pre-test of pediatric airway emergency management, followed by these consecutive interventions: (1) Interactive instructional pediatric airway videos and (2) VR trainer (HoloLens technology), simulating a pediatric critical airway event. Participants were randomized to manage anaphylaxis or foreign body aspiration. Finally, participants completed a second knowledge test (post-test) and a survey of their perceptions of the videos and VR trainer.RESULTS: Forty-one participants were included in the study. Overall, both interventions were well received. Positive perceptions included realism, interactivity, and active learning environment. Negative comments focused on video speed and the VR trainer learning curve. Participants reported preferences for future training of pediatric airway events to include videos and VR trainers, with or without didactic lectures. Most areas of knowledge showed slight to significant improvements following the interventions. Specifically, questions on pediatric anatomy, anaphylaxis, Heimlich maneuver, and foreign body removal showed the highest improvement in scores (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Interactive videos, in combination with a VR experience, provide promising zero-risk training for pediatric critical airway events.RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Pediatric airway emergencies are relatively rare, but the potential consequences are devastating. VR is established as a valued mode of education with regard to medical emergency training. Multimedia informational and instructional formats result in greater understanding of information. Results from our intervention, combining an interactive video tutorial and a VR experience, show this was well received by a cross section of health-care providers.

Surgeons With Five or More Actual Cricothyrotomies Perform Significantly Better on a Virtual Reality Simulator,"Qi, D.; Petrusa, E.; Kruger, U.; Milef, N.; Abu-Nuwar, M. R.; Haque, M.; Lim, R.; Jones, D. B.; Turkseven, M.; Demirel, D.; Halic, T.; De, S.; Saillant, N.","BACKGROUND: Discriminating performance of learners with varying experience is essential to developing and validating a surgical simulator. For rare and emergent procedures such as cricothyrotomy (CCT), the criteria to establish such groups are unclear. This study is to investigate the impact of surgeons' actual CCT experience on their virtual reality simulator performance and to determine the minimum number of actual CCTs that significantly discriminates simulator scores. Our hypothesis is that surgeons who performed more actual CCT cases would perform better on a virtual reality CCT simulator.METHODS: 47 clinicians were recruited to participate in this study at the 2018 annual conference of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons. We established groups based on three different experience thresholds, that is, the minimal number of CCT cases performed (1, 5, and 10), and compared simulator performance between these groups.RESULTS: Participants who had performed more clinical cases manifested higher mean scores in completing CCT simulation tasks, and those reporting at least 5 actual CCTs had significantly higher (P = 0.014) simulator scores than those who had performed fewer cases. Another interesting finding was that classifying participants based on experience level, that is, attendings, fellows, and residents, did not yield statistically significant differences in skills related to CCT.CONCLUSIONS: The simulator was sensitive to prior experience at a threshold of 5 actual CCTs performed.",2020,,Journal of Surgical Research,252,,247-254,32304931,,,#8870,Qi 2020,,

Teaching basic fiberoptic intubation skills in a simulator: initial learning and skills decay,"K. Latif R; Bautista, A.; Duan, X.; Neamtu, A.; Wu, D.; Wadhwa, A.; Akca, O.","PURPOSE: Generally, novices are taught fiberoptic intubation on patients by attending anesthesiologists; however, this approach raises patient safety concerns. Patient safety should improve if novice learners are trained for basic skills on simulators. In this educational study, we assessed the time and number of attempts required to train novices in fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic intubation on simulators. Because decay in skills is inevitable, we also assessed fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic intubation skill decay and the amount of effort required to regain fiberoptic bronchoscopy skill.METHODS: First, we established attempt- and duration-based quantitative norms for reaching skill proficiency for fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic intubation by experienced anesthesiologists (n = 8) and prepared an 11-step checklist and a 5-point global rating scale for assessment. Novice learners (n = 15) were trained to reach the established skill proficiency in a Virtual Reality simulator for fiberoptic bronchoscopy skills and a Human Airway Anatomy Simulator for fiberoptic intubation skills. Two months later, novices were reassessed to determine decay in learned skills and the required time to retrain them to fiberoptic bronchoscopy proficiency level.RESULTS: Proficiency in fiberoptic bronchoscopy skill level was achieved with 11 +/- 5 attempts and after 658 +/- 351 s. After 2 months without practice, the time taken by the novices to successful fiberoptic bronchoscopy on the Virtual Reality simulator increased from 41 +/- 8 to 68 +/- 31 s (P = 0.0138). Time and attempts required to retrain them were 424 +/- 230 s and 9.1 +/- 4.6 attempts, respectively.CONCLUSION: Novices were successfully trained to proficiency skill level.

Development and Validation of a Virtual Reality Haptic Femoral Nailing Simulator,"Racy, M.; Barrow, A.; Tomlinson, J.; Bello, F.","OBJECTIVE: To create a virtual reality (VR) femoral nailing simulator combining haptics and image intensifier functionality and then carry out validation studies to assess its educational value.DESIGN: The simulator consisted of a 3D virtual environment, a haptic device and 3D printed drill handle and a VR headset. The environment was created using a video game development engine, interfaced with plugins to allow haptic feedback and image intensifier functionality. Two tasks were created within the simulator as part of an antegrade femoral intramedullary (IM) nail procedure: proximal guidewire entry and distal locking.For the validation study, participants performed the above tasks on the simulator. Metrics were collected including time taken, number of X-rays and tool distance travelled and used to assess construct validity. A questionnaire was then completed to assess authenticity and content validity.SETTING: Simulator development in centre for simulation and engagement science laboratory. Validation study in a teaching hospital environment.PARTICIPANTS: Orthopedic specialist trainees and consultants.RESULTS: Surgeon experience (number of IM nails performed/postgraduate year) correlated with significantly improved task performance. More experienced surgeons took less time, used fewer X-rays and had greater economy of movement than less experienced surgeons. Authenticity and content validity were well rated, with criticisms primarily due to hardware limitations.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first orthopedic simulator to combine immersive VR with haptics and full image intensifier functionality. By combining multiple aspects of surgical practice within a single device, we aimed to improve participant immersion and educational value.

Augmented Reality in Radiology for Education and Training-A Design Study,"Raith, A.; Kamp, C.; Stoiber, C.; Jakl, A.; Wagner, M.","Education is an important component of every healthcare system. Patients need to be educated about their planned procedures; healthcare professionals need to be trained in their respective profession. Both patient education and the training of healthcare professionals are often completed in person, which requires resources and is bound to certain times and places. Virtual educational environments can potentially save human and monetary resources, increase learner engagement, and enable users to learn according to their own schedules. This design study describes proofs of concept for two augmented reality-enabled (AR) educational tools, utilizing a Microsoft HoloLens head-mounted display. In the first use case, we demonstrate an AR application which could be used to educate cancer patients about their radiotherapy treatment and potentially reduce patient anxiety. The second use case demonstrates an AR training environment, which could complement the practical training of undergraduate radiography students. Two prototypes-VIPER, for patient education, and ARTUR for the training of radiography students-were developed and tested for viability and usability, both based on individual user tests. Both patient and student education were evaluated as viable and usable additions to conventional educational methods, despite being limited in terms of accessibility, usability, and fidelity.

To assist with the teaching and learning of ultrasound-guided neuraxial anesthesia, we have created an online interactive educational model (http://www.usra.ca/vspine.php and http://pie.med.utoronto.ca/vspine). The aim of the current study was to determine whether the virtual spine model improved the knowledge of neuraxial anatomy and sonoanatomy.METHODS: After obtaining ethics board approval and written participant consent, 14 anesthesia trainees with no prior experience with spine ultrasound imaging were included in this study. Construct validity was assessed using a pretest/posttest design to measure the knowledge acquired from self-study of the virtual spine simulation modules. Two tests (A and B) with 20 multiple-choice questions were used either for the pretest or posttest, at random in order to account for possible differences in difficulty between the 2 tests. These tests were administered immediately before and after a 1-hour training session using the spine ultrasound model.RESULTS: Fourteen anesthesia trainees completed the study. Seven used test A as the pretest (group A), and 7 used test B as the pretest (group B). Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05) in test scores after a 1-hour session with the spine ultrasound model. The mean scores were 55% (SD, 11.2%) on the pretest and 77% (SD, 8.7%) on the posttest.CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that after 1 hour of self-study by the trainees on the spine ultrasound model test scores improved by 40%.",2017,,Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine,42,2,217-222,28045758,,,#8906,Ramlogan 2017,,
Notes From the Field: Secondary Task Precision for Cognitive Load Estimation During Virtual Reality Surgical Simulation Training,"Rasmussen, S. R.; Konge, L.; Mikkelsen, P. T.; Sorensen, M. S.; Andersen, S. A.","Cognitive load (CL) theory suggests that working memory can be overloaded in complex learning tasks such as surgical technical skills training, which can impair learning. Valid and feasible methods for estimating the CL in specific learning contexts are necessary before the efficacy of CL-lowering instructional interventions can be established. This study aims to explore secondary task precision for the estimation of CL in virtual reality (VR) surgical simulation and also investigate the effects of CL-modifying factors such as simulator-integrated tutoring and repeated practice. Twenty-four participants were randomized for visual assistance by a simulator-integrated tutor function during the first 5 of 12 repeated mastoidectomy procedures on a VR temporal bone simulator. Secondary task precision was found to be significantly lower during simulation compared with nonsimulation baseline, p < .001. Contrary to expectations, simulator-integrated tutoring and repeated practice did not have an impact on secondary task precision. This finding suggests that even though considerable changes in CL are reflected in secondary task precision, it lacks sensitivity. In contrast, secondary task reaction time could be more sensitive, but requires substantial postprocessing of data. Therefore, future studies on the effect of CL modifying interventions should weigh the pros and cons of the various secondary task measurements.",2016,,Evaluation & the health professions,39,1,114-20,26240091,,,#8917,Rasmussen 2016,,

Though physicians can affect caregivers' attitudes toward vaccination, physicians report uneasiness discussing vaccine hesitancy. Few studies have targeted physician-patient communication training as a means to decrease vaccination refusal.METHODS: An immersive virtual reality (VR) curriculum was created to teach pediatric residents communication skills when discussing influenza vaccine hesitancy. This pilot curriculum consisted of 3 VR simulations during which residents counseled graphical character representatives (avatars) who expressed vaccine hesitancy. Participants were randomized to the intervention (n = 24) or control (n = 21) group. Only residents in the intervention group underwent the VR curriculum.

We hypothesized that a training curriculum using virtual reality (VR) simulations would enhance residents' evidence-based skills related to behavioral health anticipatory guidance (BHAG) and motivational interviewing (MI).METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled pilot trial of our curriculum within an urban academic clinic. Intervention and control groups received four 15-minute, monthly didactics on BHAG and MI followed by VR simulations to 1) deliberately practice delivering BHAG by verbally counseling avatars, who responded real-time (intervention group) or 2) assessing pediatric respiratory distress (control group). Two months post VR training, all residents participated in a unique VR behavioral health scenario which was recorded and coded by pediatric psychologists via an observation instrument to assess residents' skills. Differences in BHAG and MI competencies were assessed via independent samples t-tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables.RESULTS: Sixty-six percent (n=55) of eligible residents completed all study protocols comprising 35 intervention and 20 control participants. Intervention participants demonstrated an increase in BHAG skills (p=0.002), percentage of open-ended questions asked (p=0.04), and percentage of MI adherent behaviors (p=0.04) when compared to the control group.CONCLUSIONS: VR may be an effective educational strategy for residents to acquire BHAG and MI skills though deliberate practice.

The current situation in further medical education combined with the increasing economic pressure in the medical field does not leave enough room for a time-consuming training in arthroscopic techniques. A structured simulation training could be an alternative solution to this problem. The benefits of arthroscopic simulation training are meanwhile well documented. The complex tasks that an expert carries out during arthroscopy can be fragmented into more simple and elementary exercises and can be trained in a stress-free environment outside the operation room. An essential advantage of simulation training is the assessment of objective measurement parameters during the individual exercises.

Experts demonstrate fluid and efficient motions when addressing pathology. The training process from novice to expert relies on hands-on experience in cadaveric laboratories and preceptorship models that require significant time and expense. This study aims to validate the use of a virtual coach to guide users step-by-step through a basic FESS.METHODS: Seventeen surgeons were grouped into novice (n = 10) and expert (n = 7) based on self-reported levels of surgical experience. Users were trained using the maxillary antrostomy module in the Neurorhinological Surgery (NRS) simulator combining the physical craniofacial model with virtual reality (VR)-tracked surgical instruments in the VR operating room. The virtual coach guided the user using surgical videos, auditory, and visual cues. The coach recorded data for each subject including the number of times borders of the nasal cavity were encountered and time to completion. Users graded the usefulness of the virtual coach on a Likert questionnaire.RESULTS: Face validity of our NRS simulator was replicated by user questionnaires, and construct validity replicated by differentiation between novice and expert level surgeons (p < 0.01). Novices contacted a significantly higher number of anatomic borders (n = 17) and had a longer operative time (t = 370 seconds).

Despite this, many mannequin-based trainers are limited by the inability of the trainee to view the internal anatomical structures. This study evaluates the usability and feasibility of a first-person point-of-view-augmented reality (AR) trainer on needle insertion as a component of central venous catheter placement.METHODS: Forty subjects, including medical students and anesthesiology residents and faculty, participated. Augmented reality glasses were provided through which the relevant internal anatomical landmarks were projected. After a practice period, participants were asked to place the needle in the mannequin without the benefit of the AR-projected internal anatomy. The ability of the trainees to correctly place the needle was documented. Participants also completed a short survey describing their perceptions of the AR technology.RESULTS: Participants reported that the AR technology was realistic (77.5%) and that the ability to view the internal anatomy was helpful (92.5%). Furthermore, 85% and 82.1%, respectively, believed that the AR technology promoted learning and should be incorporated into medical training. The ability to successfully place the needle was similar between experienced and nonexperienced participants; however, less experienced participants were more likely to inadvertently puncture the carotid artery.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot study demonstrated the usability and feasibility of AR technology as a potentially important adjunct to simulated medical skills training.

So far, the 3D sources for VR simulation have been derived from medical images, which lack real color. The authors made photographic 3D models from dissected cadavers and integrated them into the VR platform. This study aimed to introduce a method of developing a photograph-integrated VR and to evaluate the educational effect of these models.METHODS: A silicone-injected cadaver head was prepared. A CT scan of the specimen was taken, and the soft tissue and skull were segmented to 3D objects. The cadaver was dissected layer by layer, and each layer was 3D scanned by a photogrammetric method. The objects were imported to a free VR application and layered. Using the head-mounted display and controllers, the various neurosurgical approaches were demonstrated to neurosurgical residents. After performing hands-on virtual surgery with photographic 3D models, a feedback survey was collected from 31 participants.RESULTS: Photographic 3D models were seamlessly integrated into the VR platform. Various skull base approaches were successfully performed with photograph-integrated VR. During virtual dissection, the landmark anatomical structures were identified based on their color and shape. Respondents rated a higher score for photographic 3D models than for conventional 3D models (4.3 +/- 0.8 vs 3.2 +/- 1.1, respectively; p = 0.001). They responded that performing virtual surgery with photographic 3D models would help to improve their surgical skills and to develop and study new surgical approaches.CONCLUSIONS: The authors introduced photographic 3D models to the virtual surgery platform for the first time.

Surgical Telementoring Without Encumbrance: A Comparative Study of See-through Augmented Reality-based Approaches,"Rojas-Munoz, E.; Cabrera, M. E.; Andersen, D.; Popescu, V.; Marley, S.; Mullis, B.; Zarzaur, B.; Wachs, J.","OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the benefits of a surgical telementoring system based on an augmented reality head-mounted display (ARHMD) that overlays surgical instructions directly onto the surgeon's view of the operating field, without workspace obstruction.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In conventional telestrator-based telementoring, the surgeon views annotations of the surgical field by shifting focus to a nearby monitor, which substantially increases cognitive load. As an alternative, tablets have been used between the surgeon and the patient to display instructions; however, tablets impose additional obstructions of surgeon's motions.METHODS: Twenty medical students performed anatomical marking (Task1) and abdominal incision (Task2) on a patient simulator, in 1 of 2 telementoring conditions: ARHMD and telestrator. The dependent variables were placement error, number of focus shifts, and completion time. Furthermore, workspace efficiency was quantified as the number and duration of potential surgeon-tablet collisions avoided by the ARHMD.RESULTS: The ARHMD condition yielded smaller placement errors (Task1: 45%, P < 0.001; Task2: 14%, P = 0.01), fewer focus shifts (Task1: 93%, P < 0.001; Task2: 88%, P = 0.0039), and longer completion times (Task1: 31%, P < 0.001; Task2: 24%, P = 0.013). Furthermore, the ARHMD avoided potential tablet collisions (4.8 for 3.2 seconds in Task1; 3.8 for 1.3 seconds in Task2).CONCLUSION: The ARHMD system promises to improve accuracy and to eliminate focus shifts in surgical telementoring. Because ARHMD participants were able to refine their execution of instructions, task completion time increased.

This paper evaluates the system for telementoring with augmented reality (STAR), a portable and self-contained telementoring platform based on an augmented reality head-mounted display (ARHMD). The system is designed to assist in austere scenarios: a stabilized first-person view of the operating field is sent to a remote expert, who creates surgical instructions that a local first responder wearing the ARHMD can visualize as three-dimensional models projected onto the patient's body. Our hypothesis evaluated whether remote guidance with STAR could lead to performing a surgical procedure better, as opposed to remote audio-only guidance. Remote expert surgeons guided first responders through training cricothyroidotomies in a simulated austere scenario, and on-site surgeons evaluated the participants using standardized evaluation tools. The evaluation comprehended completion time and technique performance of specific cricothyroidotomy steps. The analyses were also performed considering the participants' years of experience as first responders, and their experience performing cricothyroidotomies. A linear mixed model analysis showed that using STAR was associated with higher procedural and non-procedural scores, and overall better performance. Additionally, a binary logistic regression analysis showed that using STAR was associated to safer and more successful executions of cricothyroidotomies. This work demonstrates that remote mentors can use STAR to provide first responders with guidance and surgical knowledge, and represents a first step towards the adoption of ARHMDs to convey clinical expertise remotely in austere scenarios.",2020,,npj Digital Medicine,3,,75,32509972,,,#9003,Rojas-Munoz 2020,,
Failure affects subjective estimates of cognitive load through a negative carry-over effect in virtual reality simulation of hip fracture surgery,"Rolfing, J. D.; Norskov, J. K.; Paltved, C.; Konge, L.; Andersen, S. A. W.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive overload can impair learning, and different factors might affect cognitive load during simulation-based training. In this study, we investigate the role of failure in repeated practice of virtual reality (VR) simulation of hip fracture surgery on cognitive load (CL) estimated by secondary-task reaction time test and two questionnaires.METHODS: The VR simulation training program consisted of three competency levels of increasing complexity starting with the placement of a Kirschner wire in a fractured hip of one patient, adding clinical variability at the intermediate level, and performing the entire dynamic hip screw procedure in 24 different patients at the highest level. Thirteen consecutive passed simulations were required to advance to the next level. Performance was measured as passing/failing a procedure and the number of failed procedures within the latest three and five simulations. CL was measured objectively using reaction time testing during simulation and subjectively using the NASA-TLX and PAAS questionnaires. The study was carried out at a simulation center from November 2016 to March 2019. Forty-two first-year orthopedic surgery residents from the Central Denmark Region and the North Denmark Region participated in the training program.RESULTS: A failing performance in the simulated procedure was associated with a higher CL than passing a procedure. The subjective CL estimates were affected by the number of failures during last three and five procedures with a higher number of failures being associated with a higher CL. In contrast, relative reaction time estimates of CL were not affected by previous failures.CONCLUSIONS: Questionnaires for estimation of CL seem to be affected by participant frustration after failure-a meta-cognitive ""carry-over"" effect. This could be a general limitation of the subjective questionnaire approach to estimate CL. Reducing CL through instructional design and handling of participant frustration might improve the learning outcome of simulation training programs.",2019,,Advances in Simulation,4,,26,31832243,,,#9005,Rolfing 2019,,

Augmented Reality Microsurgery: A Tool for Training Micromanipulations in Ophthalmic Surgery Using Augmented Reality,"Ropelato, S.; Menozzi, M.; Michel, D.; Siegrist, M.","INTRODUCTION: Current methods of training microsurgical interventions have various limitations, including limited transferability to the human model, economic demands, and ethical concerns. In this article, we show how surgery simulations can overcome these issues and how, combined with the application of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), they can be used to train tasks in ophthalmic surgery more efficiently.METHODS: We investigated physician trainee efficiency of learning microsurgical skills using our purpose-built microsurgery simulator that tracks a micromanipulator and displays a three-dimensional representation of the interior of a human eye in an augmented reality (AR) headset. The expertise of ophthalmic surgeons helped define five subtasks corresponding to the steps of internal limiting membrane peeling. Using our AR surgery simulation, 50 participants underwent two training sessions, one using the ITS that dynamically adapts the task sequence to the participant's progress and one using a fixed task sequence.RESULTS: We found significant improvement in micromanipulation performance in the first training session with both the ITS and classic training. In the second session, however, only the participants training with the ITS had further improvements in performance.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrate the usability of AR simulation in training micromanipulation skills and support the claim that simulators can be used in ophthalmic surgery training. This study also extends the existing literature by demonstrating an application of ITS for surgical training. The potential of this method is further analyzed in ongoing studies and discussions with experts in ophthalmic surgery.",2020,,Simulation in Healthcare: The Journal of The Society for Medical Simulation,15,2,122-127,32044852,,,#9010,Ropelato 2020,,
Lessons Learned: Raising Awareness of Civility and Incivility Using Semi-Virtual Reality Simulation,"Rose, K. A.; Jenkins, S. D.; Astroth, K.; Woith, W.; Jarvill, M.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of our web-based, semi-virtual reality simulation was to raise baccalaureate nursing students' awareness of civility and incivility. Educators know civility in nursing is crucial to safe and effective patient care. However, nursing students have reported physiological and psychological distress after experiencing incivility. If nurse educators are unable to better promote civility, the quality of nursing education, and ultimately nursing practice, is threatened.METHOD: We implemented an innovative civility-related, semi-virtual reality, simulation with senior-level nursing students. After attending a faculty-led discussion on the importance of civility and incivility, students participated in a web-based, semi-virtual reality simulation, followed by a synchronous debriefing session.RESULTS: Students reported that the intervention raised their awareness of civility and incivility.CONCLUSION: This article describes the intervention and shares the lessons learned in implementing it so nurse educators may replicate this innovative strategy to raise awareness of civility in nursing education.

"The Use of Immersive and Virtual Reality Technologies to Enable Nursing Students to Experience Scenario-Based, Basic Life Support Training-Exploring the Impact on Confidence and Skills","Rushton, M. A.; Drumm, I. A.; Campion, S. P.; O'Hare, J. J.","The link between effective basic life support and survival following cardiac arrest is well known. Nurses are often first responders at in-hospital cardiac arrests and receive annual basic life support training to ensure they have the adequate skills, and student nurses are taught this in preparation for their clinical practice. However, it is clear that some nurses still lack confidence and skills to perform basic life support in an emergency situation. This innovative study included 209 participants, used a mixed-methods approach, and examined three environments to compare confidence and skills in basic life support training. The environments were nonimmersive (basic skills room), immersive (immersive room with video technology), and the Octave (mixed reality facility). The skills were measured using a Laerdal training manikin (QCPR manikin), with data recorded on a wireless Laerdal Simpad, and confidence levels before and after training were measured using a questionnaire. The nonimmersive and the immersive rooms were familiar environments, and the students felt more comfortable, relaxed, and, thus, more confident. The Octave offered the higher level of simulation utilizing virtual reality technology. Students felt less comfortable and less confident in the Octave; we assert that this was because the environment was unfamiliar. The study identified that placing students in an unfamiliar environment influences the confidence and skills associated with basic life support; this could be used as a way of preparing student nurses with the necessary emotional resilience to cope in stressful situations.",2020,,"CIN: Computers, Informatics, Nursing",38,6,281-293,32149741,,,#9034,Rushton 2020,,

Nursing students' views of using virtual reality in healthcare: A qualitative study,"Saab, M. M.; Landers, M.; Murphy, D.; O'Mahony, B.; Cooke, E.; O'Driscoll, M.; Hegarty, J.","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study explored nursing students' views of using virtual reality in healthcare.BACKGROUND: The popularity and use of virtual reality in healthcare delivery and education is on the rise. Yet, the views of future nurses regarding this technology remain underexplored.DESIGN: This is a qualitative descriptive study guided by a naturalistic inquiry and reported using the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist.METHODS: Nursing students (n = 26) were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling. They were first exposed to a virtual reality intervention aimed to enhance men's awareness of testicular diseases. This was attempted to familiarise participants with the technology and initiate conversations around its use in healthcare. Participants were then interviewed face-to-face, either individually or within focus groups. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.RESULTS: Four themes were identified: (i) positive experiences of virtual reality; (ii) challenges to using virtual reality; (iii) settings where virtual reality can be implemented; and (iv) blue-sky and future applications of virtual reality. Participants described this technology as novel, enjoyable, immersive, memorable and inclusive. They questioned, however, the suitability of virtual reality for older adults, reported minor technical difficulties and stressed the importance of prior preparation in the use of the technology. Virtual reality was recommended for use in outpatient healthcare settings, schools and the community. Participants suggested using virtual reality in health promotion, disease prevention and management, and to promote nurses' empathy towards patients.CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the potential role of virtual reality in assisting nurses in promoting health and managing disease.

Virtual reality in pediatric cardiology: hype or hope for the future?,"Sacks, L. D.; Axelrod, D. M.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the field of pediatric cardiology, a sub-specialty that relies on an understanding of complex three-dimensional structures, virtual reality technology may represent a new and exciting tool for both practitioners and patients. Here, the current medical and surgical applications of virtual reality are reviewed and the potential for future applications explored.RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple centers have begun to develop software designed to bring virtual reality technology to bear on congenital heart disease. These efforts have focused on surgical preparation, on education of medical providers, and on preparation of patients and their family members for cardiac interventions. Though relatively little statistical evidence for benefit has been generated to date, those studies currently available suggest that virtual reality may provide a significant benefit in all three of these aspects of medical care.SUMMARY: The immersive nature of virtual reality meshes well with the learning styles of adult practitioners and promises to be a powerful tool for both pediatric cardiologists and the patients with whose care they are entrusted. Though additional studies are clearly needed, this technology promises to improve the field's ability to prepare providers and patients alike for challenge of treating congenital heart disease.",2020,,Current Opinion in Cardiology,35,1,37-41,31644471,,,#9050,Sacks 2020,,
Virtual Reality Simulation Training for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation After Cardiac Surgery: Face and Content Validity Study,"Sadeghi, A. H.; Peek, J. J.; Max, S. A.; Smit, L. L.; Martina, B. G.; Rosalia, R. A.; Bakhuis, W.; Bogers, A. J.; Mahtab, E. A.","BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery commonly has a reversible cause, where emergency resternotomy is often required for treatment, as recommended by international guidelines. We have developed a virtual reality (VR) simulation for training of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency resternotomy procedures after cardiac surgery, the Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Virtual Reality Simulator (CPVR-sim). Two fictive clinical scenarios were used: one case of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and a combined case of PEA and ventricular fibrillation. In this prospective study, we researched the face validity and content validity of the CPVR-sim.OBJECTIVE: We designed a prospective study to assess the feasibility and to establish the face and content validity of two clinical scenarios (shockable and nonshockable cardiac arrest) of the CPVR-sim partly divided into a group of novices and experts in performing CPR and emergency resternotomies in patients after cardiac surgery.METHODS: Clinicians (staff cardiothoracic surgeons, physicians, surgical residents, nurse practitioners, and medical students) participated in this study and performed two different scenarios, either PEA or combined PEA and ventricular fibrillation. All participants (N=41) performed a simulation and completed the questionnaire rating the simulator's usefulness, satisfaction, ease of use, effectiveness, and immersiveness to assess face validity and content validity.RESULTS: Responses toward face validity and content validity were predominantly positive in both groups. Most participants in the PEA scenario (n=26, 87%) felt actively involved in the simulation, and 23 (77%) participants felt in charge of the situation. The participants thought it was easy to learn how to interact with the software (n=24, 80%) and thought that the software responded adequately (n=21, 70%). All 15 (100%) expert participants preferred VR training as an addition to conventional training. Moreover, 13 (87%) of the expert participants would recommend VR training to other colleagues, and 14 (93%) of the expert participants thought the CPVR-sim was a useful method to train for infrequent post-cardiac surgery emergencies requiring CPR. Additionally, 10 (91%) of the participants thought it was easy to move in the VR environment, and that the CPVR-sim responded adequately in this scenario.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a proof-of-concept VR simulation for CPR training with two scenarios of a patient after cardiac surgery, which participants found was immersive and useful. By proving the face validity and content validity of the CPVR-sim, we present the first step toward a cardiothoracic surgery VR training platform.",2022,,JMIR Serious Games,10,1,e30456,35234652,,,#9052,Sadeghi 2022,,

W.; Irish, J. C.","OBJECTIVE: To report the first use of a novel projected augmented reality (AR) system in open sinonasal tumor resections in preclinical models and to compare the AR approach with an advanced intraoperative navigation (IN) system.METHODS: Four tumor models were created. Five head and neck surgeons participated in the study performing virtual osteotomies. Unguided, AR, IN, and AR + IN simulations were performed. Statistical comparisons between approaches were obtained. Intratumoral cut rate was the main outcome. The groups were also compared in terms of percentage of intratumoral, close, adequate, and excessive distances from the tumor. Information on a wearable gaze tracker headset and NASA Task Load Index questionnaire results were analyzed as well.RESULTS: A total of 335 cuts were simulated. Intratumoral cuts were observed in 20.7%, 9.4%, 1.2,% and 0% of the unguided, AR, IN, and AR + IN simulations, respectively (p < 0.0001). The AR was superior than the unguided approach in univariate and multivariate models. The percentage of time looking at the screen during the procedures was 55.5% for the unguided approaches and 0%, 78.5%, and 61.8% in AR, IN, and AR + IN, respectively (p < 0.001). The combined approach significantly reduced the screen time compared with the IN procedure alone.CONCLUSION: We reported the use of a novel AR system for oncological resections in open sinonasal approaches, with improved margin delineation compared with unguided techniques. AR improved the gaze-toggling drawback of IN. Further refinements of the AR system are needed before translating our experience to clinical practice.",2021,,Frontiers in Oncology,11,,723509,34790568,,,#9060,Sahovaler 2021,,
Evaluation of a Virtual Reality Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) Surgical Simulator,"Sainsbury, B.; Lacki, M.; Shahait, M.; Goldenberg, M.; Baghdadi, A.; Cavuoto, L.; Ren, J.; Green, M.; Lee, J.; Averch, T. D.; Rossa, C.","Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy is the standard surgical procedure used to remove large kidney stones. PCNL procedures have a steep learning curve; a physician needs to complete between 36 and 60 procedures, to achieve clinical proficiency. Marion Surgical K181 is a virtual reality surgical simulator, which emulates the PCNL procedures without compromising the well-being of patients. The simulator uses a VR headset to place a user in a realistic and immersive operating theater, and haptic force-feedback robots to render physical interactions between surgical tools and the virtual patient. The simulator has two modules for two different aspects of PCNL kidney stone removal procedure: kidney access module where the user must insert a needle into the kidney of the patient, and a kidney stone removal module where the user removes the individual stones from the organ. In this paper, we present user trials to validate the face and construct validity of the simulator. The results, based on the data gathered from 4 groups of users independently, indicate that Marion's surgical simulator is a useful tool for teaching and practicing PCNL procedures. The kidney stone removal module of the simulator has proven construct validity by identifying the skill level of different users based on their tool path.

T.","PROBLEM: While bedside training has always presented its own unique challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic era has intensified barriers to suitable provider and trainee experiences for both patient care and medical education.APPROACH: This project introduced an innovative solution with the Extended Reality International Grand Rounds, a collaboration between the University of Michigan Center for Medical and Surgical Extended Reality and Imperial College London. Three complex cases were presented to trainees through a wireless, extended reality (XR) headset and augmented by holographic visual aids and expert commentary. This pilot rounding experience was performed through the first-person view of one clinician at the bedside.OUTCOMES: In 2020, 140 attendees participated in XR International Grand Rounds, and 82 (59%) and 61 (44%) completed pre- and postsurveys, respectively. Survey analysis showed that the majority of respondents (65, 79.3%) had very little to no baseline experience with XR technologies and nearly all (75, 91.5%) agreed that the development and implementation of XR curricula are important in medical training, indicating an unmet need. Nearly all respondents (59, 96.7%) found value in the ability to visualize patients' clinical findings in the XR rounding experience and 60 (98.4%) found value in the ability to visualize patient-specific imaging and test findings in an XR format. Limiting exposure to high-risk patients and care team members with this innovative format was believed to be important to 79 (96.3%) respondents at baseline and that perception was unchanged following the event.NEXT STEPS: This solution to a long-standing dilemma, newly stressed by a unique era in medicine, was a successful collaboration using state-of-the-art XR technology.

A.; Blanch-Hartigan, D.","OBJECTIVE: This scoping review explores the potential for virtual environments (VE) to evaluate emotional outcomes in clinical communication research. Authors representing multiple disciplines use review results to propose potential research opportunities and considerations.METHODS: We utilized a structured framework for scoping reviews. We searched four literature databases for relevant articles. We applied multidisciplinary perspectives to synthesize relevant potential opportunities for emotion-focused communications research using VE.RESULTS: Twenty-one articles met inclusion criteria. They applied different methodological approaches, including a range of VE technologies and diverse emotional outcome measures, such as psychophysiological arousal, emotional valence, or empathy. Major research topics included use of virtual reality to provoke and measure emotional responses, train clinicians in communication skills, and increase clinician empathy.CONCLUSION: Researchers may leverage VE technologies to ethically and systematically examine how characteristics of clinical interactions, environments, and communication impact emotional reactions and responses among patients and clinicians. Variability exists in how VE technologies are employed and reported in published literature, and this may limit the internal and external validity of the research. However, virtual reality can provide a low-cost, low-risk, experimentally controlled, and ecologically valid approach for studying clinician-patient communication.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future research should leverage psychophysiological measures to further examine emotional responses during clinical communication scenarios and clearly report virtual environment characteristics to support evaluation of study conclusions, study replicability, and meta-analyses.",2021,,Patient Education & Counseling,104,12,2922-2935,34020839,,,#9083,Sanders 2021,,

The SAGES has established the FUSE program to address the knowledge gap in the proper and safe usage of electrosurgical devices. Complementing it, we have developed the Virtual Electrosurgery Skill Trainer (VEST(©)), which is designed to train subjects in both cognitive and motor skills necessary to safely operate electrosurgical devices. The objective of this study is to asses the face validity of the VEST(©) simulator.METHODS: Sixty-three subjects were recruited at the 2014 SAGES Learning Center. They all completed the monopolar electrosurgery module on the VEST(©) simulator. At the end of the study, subjects assessed the face validity with questions that were scored on a 5-point Likert scale.RESULTS: The subjects were divided into two groups; FUSE experience (n = 15) and no FUSE experience (n = 48). The median score for both the groups was 4 or higher on all questions and 5 on questions on effectiveness of VEST(©) in aiding learning electrosurgery fundamentals. Questions on using the simulator in their own skills lab and recommending it to their peers also scored at 5. Mann-Whitney U test showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) indicating a general agreement. 46% of the respondents preferred VEST compared with 52% who preferred animal model and 2% preferred both for training in electrosurgery.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the face validity of the VEST(©) simulator. High scores showed that the simulator was visually realistic and reproduced lifelike tissue effects and the features were adequate enough to provide high realism. The self-learning instructional material was also found to be very useful in learning the fundamentals of electrosurgery.

Gaining proficiency in this field requires training both inside and outside of the operating room. Simulation plays a key role in training surgeons in colorectal surgery. The goal of this study is to review the currently available simulators for training in the field of colorectal surgery. <b>Methods:</b> A review of the literature was conducted to identify simulators that are both physical such as benchtop, live animal, and cadaver, as wells as virtual reality (VR) simulators. Any reported validity evidence for these simulators were also presented. <b>Results:</b> There are several benchtop physical models made of silicone for training in basic colorectal tasks, such as hand-sewn and stapled anastomosis. To improve realism, explanted animal and cadaveric specimens were also used for training. To improve repeatability, objective assessment, both commercial and VR simulators also exist for training in both open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery and emerging areas such as endoscopic submucosal dissection. <b>Conclusion: </b> Simulation-based training in colorectal surgery is here to stay and is going to play a significant role in training, credentialing, and quality improvements.",2021,,Journal of Laparoendoscopic & Advanced Surgical Techniques.

Quantification of Student Radiographic Patient Positioning Using an Immersive Virtual Reality Simulation,"Sapkaroski, D.; Baird, M.; Mundy, M.; Dimmock, M. R.","INTRODUCTION: Immersive virtual reality (VR) simulation environments facilitate novel ways for users to visualize anatomy and quantify performance relative to expert users. The ability of software to provide positional feedback before a practitioner progresses with subsequent stages of examinations has broad implications for primary and allied healthcare professionals, particularly with respect to health and safety (eg, exposing to x-rays). The effect of training student-radiographers (radiology technicians), with a VR simulation environment was quantitatively assessed.METHODS: Year 1 radiography students (N = 76) were randomly split into 2 cohorts, each of which were trained at performing the same tasks relating to optimal hand positioning for projection x-ray imaging; group 1 was trained using the CETSOL VR Clinic software, whereas group 2 was trained using conventional simulated role-play in a real clinical environment. All participants completed an examination 3 weeks after training. The examination required both posterior-anterior and oblique hand x-ray positioning tasks to be performed on a real patient model. The analysis of images from the examination enabled quantification of the students' performance. The results were contextualized through a comparison with 4 expert radiographers.RESULTS: Students in group 1 performed on average 36% (P < 0.001) better in relation to digit separation, 11% (P <= 0.001) better in terms of palm flatness and 23% (P < 0.05) better in terms of central ray positioning onto the third metacarpal.CONCLUSION: A significant difference in patient positioning was evident between the groups; the VR clinic cohort demonstrated improved patient positioning outcomes. The observed improvement is attributed to the inherent task deconstruction and variety of visualization mechanisms available in immersive VR environments.",2019,,Simulation in Healthcare: The Journal of The Society for Medical Simulation,14,4,258-263,31274828,,,#9100,Sapkaroski 2019,,
Immersive virtual reality simulated learning environment versus role-play for empathic clinical communication training,"Sapkaroski, D.; Mundy, M.; Dimmock, M. R.","INTRODUCTION: The use of immersive virtual reality simulated learning environments (VR SLEs) for improving clinical communication can offer desirable qualities including repetition and determinism in a safe environment. The aim of this study was to establish whether the mode of delivery, VR SLE versus clinical role-play, could have a measurable effect on clinical empathic communication skills for MRI scenarios.METHODS: A split-cohort study was performed with trainee practitioners (n = 70) and qualified practitioners (n = 9). Participants were randomly assigned to four groups: clinician VR (CVR), clinician role-play (CRP), trainee VR (TVR), and trainee RP (TRP). Clinical communication skills were assessed using two methods: firstly, a self-reported measure - the SE-12 communication questionnaire and, secondly, a training and assessment tool developed by a panel of experts.RESULTS: Participants in the VR trainee (TVR) and clinician (CVR) groups reported 11% (P < 0.05) and 7.2% (P < 0.05) improvements in communication confidence post training, whereas trainees assigned to the role-play (TRP) intervention reported a 4.3% (P < 0.05) improvement. Empirical assessment of communication training scores assessing a participant's ability to select empathic statements showed the TVR group performed 5% better on average than their role-play counterparts (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: The accuracy of participant's selection of appropriate empathic responses was shown to differ significantly following the training intervention designed to improve interactions with patients that present for an MRI scan. The results may demonstrate the capacity for immersion into an emotional narrative in a VR environment to increase the user's susceptibility for recalling and selecting empathic terminology.",2022,,Journal of Medical Radiation Sciences,69,1,56-65,34706398,,,#9102,Sapkaroski 2022,,
Visualization Improves Supraclavicular Access to the Subclavian Vein in a Mixed Reality Simulator,"Sappenfield, J. W.; Smith, W. B.; Cooper, L. A.; Lizdas, D.; Gonsalves, D. B.; Gravenstein, N.; Lampotang, S.; Robinson, A. R., 3rd","BACKGROUND: We investigated whether visual augmentation (3D, real-time, color visualization) of a procedural simulator improved performance during training in the supraclavicular approach to the subclavian vein, not as widely known or used as its infraclavicular counterpart.METHODS: To train anesthesiology residents to access a central vein, a mixed reality simulator with emulated ultrasound imaging was created using an anatomically authentic, 3D-printed, physical mannequin based on a computed tomographic scan of an actual human. The simulator has a corresponding 3D virtual model of the neck and upper chest anatomy. Hand-held instruments such as a needle, an ultrasound probe, and a virtual camera controller are directly manipulated by the trainee and tracked and recorded with submillimeter resolution via miniature, 6 degrees of freedom magnetic sensors. After Institutional Review Board approval, 69 anesthesiology residents and faculty were enrolled and received scripted instructions on how to perform subclavian venous access using the supraclavicular approach based on anatomic landmarks. The volunteers were randomized into 2 cohorts. The first used real-time 3D visualization concurrently with trial 1, but not during trial 2. The second did not use real-time 3D visualization concurrently with trial 1 or 2. However, after trial 2, they observed a 3D visualization playback of trial 2 before performing trial 3 without visualization. An automated scoring system based on time, success, and errors/complications generated objective performance scores. Nonparametric statistical methods were used to compare the scores between subsequent trials, differences between groups (real-time visualization versus no visualization versus delayed visualization), and improvement in scores between trials within groups.RESULTS: Although the real-time visualization group demonstrated significantly better performance than the delayed visualization group on trial 1 (P = .01), there was no difference in gain scores, between performance on the first trial and performance on the final trial, that were dependent on group (P = .13). In the delayed visualization group, the difference in performance between trial 1 and trial 2 was not significant (P = .09); reviewing performance on trial 2 before trial 3 resulted in improved performance when compared to trial 1 (P < .0001). There was no significant difference in median scores (P = .13) between the real-time visualization and delayed visualization groups for the last trial after both groups had received visualization. Participants reported a significant improvement in confidence in performing supraclavicular access to the subclavian vein. Standard deviations of scores, a measure of performance variability, decreased in the delayed visualization group after viewing the visualization.CONCLUSIONS: Real-time visual augmentation (3D visualization) in the mixed reality simulator improved performance during supraclavicular access to the subclavian vein. No difference was seen in the final trial of the group that received real-time visualization compared to the group that had delayed visualization playback of their prior attempt.

Role of Simulation in Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) Training: A Preliminary Study,"Saratzis, A.; Calderbank, T.; Sidloff, D.; Bown, M. J.; Davies, R. S.","BACKGROUND: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) requires a high-level of technical-competency to avoid device-related complications. Virtual reality simulation-based training (SBT) may offer an alternative method of psychomotor skill acquisition; however, its role in EVAR training is undefined. This study aimed to: a) benchmark competency levels using EVAR SBT, and b) investigate the impact of supervised SBT on trainee performance.METHODS: EVAR procedure-related metrics were benchmarked by six experienced consultants using a Simbionix Angiomentor EVAR simulator. Sixteen vascular surgical trainees performing a comparable EVAR before and after structured SBT (>4 teaching sessions) were assessed utilising a modified Likert-scale score. These were benchmarked for comparison against the standard set by the consultant body.RESULTS: Median procedural-time for consultants was 43.5 min (IQR 7.5). A significant improvement in trainee procedural-time following SBT was observed (median procedural time 77 min [IQR 20.75] vs. 56 min [IQR: 7.00], p < .0001). The mean (SD) trainee Likert score pre- and post-SBT improved (16.6 [SD 1.455] vs. 28.63 [SD 2.986], p < .0001). Fewer endoleaks were observed (p = .0063) and trainees chose an appropriately sized device more often after SBT.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that EVAR-SBT should be considered as an adjunct to standard psychomotor skill teaching techniques for EVAR within the vascular surgery training curricula.",2017,,European Journal of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery,53,2,193-198,28003104,,,#9106,Saratzis 2017,,
EBUS-STAT Subscore Analysis to Predict the Efficacy and Assess the Validity of Virtual Reality Simulation for EBUS-TBNA Training Among Experienced Bronchoscopists,"Scarlata, S.; Palermo, P.; Candoli, P.; Tofani, A.; Petitti, T.; Corbetta, L.","BACKGROUND: Linear endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) represents a pivotal innovation in interventional pulmonology; determining the best approach to guarantee systematic and efficient training is expected to become a main issue in the forthcoming years. Virtual reality simulators have been proposed as potential EBUS-TBNA training instruments, to avoid unskilled beginners practicing directly in real-life settings. A validated and perfected simulation program could be used before allowing beginners to practice on patients. Our goal was to test the reliability of the EBUS-Skills and Task Assessment Tool (STAT) and its subscores for measuring the competence of experienced bronchoscopists approaching EBUS-guided TBNA, using only the virtual reality simulator as both a training and an assessment tool.METHODS: Fifteen experienced bronchoscopists, with poor or no experience in EBUS-TBNA, participated in this study. They were all administered the Italian version of the EBUS-STAT evaluation tool, during a high-fidelity virtual reality simulation. This was followed by a single 7-hour theoretical and practical (on simulators) session on EBUS-TBNA, at the end of which their skills were reassessed by EBUS-STAT.RESULTS: An overall, significant improvement in EBUS-TBNA skills was observed, thereby confirming that (a) virtual reality simulation can facilitate practical learning among practitioners, and (b) EBUS-STAT is capable of detecting these improvements. The test's overall ability to detect differences was negatively influenced by the minimal variation of the scores relating to items 1 and 2, was not influenced by the training, and improved significantly when the 2 items were not considered. Apart from these 2 items, all the remaining subscores were equally capable of revealing improvements in the learner. Lastly, we found that trainees with presimulation EBUS-STAT scores above 79 did not show any significant improvement after virtual reality training, suggesting that this score represents a cutoff value capable of predicting the likelihood that simulation can be beneficial.CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality simulation is capable of providing a practical learning tool for practitioners with previous experience in flexible bronchoscopy, and the EBUS-STAT questionnaire is capable of detecting these changes. A pretraining EBUS-STAT score below 79 is a good indicator of those candidates who will benefit from the simulation training. Further studies are needed to verify whether a modified version of the questionnaire would be capable of improving its performance among experienced bronchoscopists.",2017,,Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology,24,2,110-116,28323724,,,#9125,Scarlata 2017,,
Virtual reality simulation in robot-assisted surgery: meta-analysis of skill transfer and predictability of skill,"Schmidt, M. W.; Koppinger, K. F.; Fan, C.; Kowalewski, K. F.; Schmidt, L.

P.; Nickel, F.","BACKGROUND: The value of virtual reality (VR) simulators for robot-assisted surgery (RAS) for skill assessment and training of surgeons has not been established. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify evidence on transferability of surgical skills acquired on robotic VR simulators to the operating room and the predictive value of robotic VR simulator performance for intraoperative performance.METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched systematically. Risk of bias was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for Education. Correlation coefficients were chosen as effect measure and pooled using the inverse-variance weighting approach. A random-effects model was applied to estimate the summary effect.RESULTS: A total of 14 131 potential articles were identified; there were eight studies eligible for qualitative and three for quantitative analysis. Three of four studies demonstrated transfer of surgical skills from robotic VR simulators to the operating room measured by time and technical surgical performance. Two of three studies found significant positive correlations between robotic VR simulator performance and intraoperative technical surgical performance; quantitative analysis revealed a positive combined correlation (r = 0.67, 95 per cent c.i. 0.22 to 0.88).CONCLUSION: Technical surgical skills acquired through robotic VR simulator training can be transferred to the operating room, and operating room performance seems to be predictable by robotic VR simulator performance. VR training can therefore be justified before operating on patients.",2021,,BJS Open,5,2,5,33864069,,,#9144,Schmidt 2021,,
Skills improvement after observation or direct practice of a simulated laparoscopic intervention,"Schmitt, F.; Mariani, A.; Eyssartier, E.; Granry, J. C.; Podevin, G.","BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic skills are more and more often being learned on simulators.PURPOSE: To assess the respective roles of observation and direct practice in the retention of laparoscopic procedural skills.BASIC PROCEDURES: Twelve surgical residents were included in a two-session laparoscopic training course. During the first session (S1), one participant completed a cholecystectomy on the Simbionix LAPMentor TM and then observed his colleague carrying out a total hysterectomy and vice versa. During the second session (S2), each participant completed both interventions. Skills evaluation was assessed using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) global rating scale and LAPMentor TM metrics.MAIN FINDINGS: Mean OSATS score during the first session was 19.3+/-5.1, and increased by 37% in the group of former observer students (S2O, P=0.003), and by 54% in the group of former practising students (S2A, P=0.001). Self- and peer-grading results were concordant with the supervisor's evaluation. Detailed analysis of LAPMentor TM metrics showed a trend toward more parameters being improved in group S2A as compared to group S2O on both interventions. The most significant improvements concerned the time of completion for the hysterectomy and the efficiency of cautery for the cholecystectomy.CONCLUSIONS: Observation of laparoscopic skills still allows for surgical improvement, but direct practice on a virtual reality trainer provides better results. Self- and peer-grading were concordant with the supervisor's evaluation. This work may advocate the integration of both personal training on simulators and surgical observation into residents' surgical curricula.",2018,,Journal of Gynecology Obstetrics and Human Reproduction,47,3,101-106,29292236,,,#9148,Schmitt 2018,,
Learning Laparoscopic Skills: Observation or Practice?,"Schmitt, F.; Mariani, A.; Eyssartier, E.; Granry, J. C.; Podevin, G.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the respective roles of observation and direct practice in the retention of laparoscopic skills.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen fifth-year medical students were included in a two-session laparoscopic learning course. During the first session, each participant was given four tasks to complete from the ""Basic skills"" and ""Essential tasks"" modules of the Simbionix LAP Mentor TM, and another four tasks for observation only. During the second session, each participant completed all eight tasks. Performance evaluation was assessed using the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) global rating scale and LAP Mentor metrics.RESULTS: The mean OSATS score during the first session (S1) was 16.7 +/- 3.2. This increased by 34% during the second session (S2), reaching 21.8 +/- 2.6 in the group of former observer students (S2O, P < .0001), and by 56% (25.1 +/- 1.9) in the group of former practicing students (S2A, P < .0001). The analysis of LAP Mentor metrics showed that 14 of 28 parameters (50%) improved in the S2A group compared to S1, whereas only 25% of the parameters improved in the S2O group, the difference being significant (P = .048). In both groups, the more complex the task, the more the number of improved parameters decreased.CONCLUSIONS: Although simple observation of laparoscopic skills improved further performance, direct practice on the virtual reality trainer ensured more effective training.

"Mixed reality for teaching catheter placement to medical students: a randomized single-blinded, prospective trial","Schoeb, D. S.; Schwarz, J.; Hein, S.; Schlager, D.; Pohlmann, P. F.; Frankenschmidt, A.; Gratzke, C.; Miernik, A.","BACKGROUND: Cost-effective methods to facilitate practical medical education are in high demand and the ""mixed-reality"" (MR) technology seems suitable to provide students with instructions when learning a new practical task. To evaluate a step-by-step mixed reality (MR) guidance system for instructing a practical medical procedure, we conducted a randomized, single-blinded prospective trial on medical students learning bladder catheter placement.METHODS: We enrolled 164 medical students. Students were randomized into 2 groups and received instructions on how to perform bladder catheter placement on a male catheterization training model. One group (107 students) were given their instructions by an instructor, while the other group (57 students) were instructed via an MR guidance system using a Microsoft HoloLens. Both groups did hands on training. A standardized questionnaire covering previous knowledge, interest in modern technologies and a self-evaluation was filled out. In addition, students were asked to evaluate the system's usability. We assessed both groups's learning outcome via a standardized OSCE (objective structured clinical examination).RESULTS: Our evaluation of the learning outcome revealed an average point value of 19.96 +/- 2,42 for the control group and 21.49 +/- 2.27 for the MR group - the MR group's result was significantly better (p = 0.00). The self-evaluations revealed no difference between groups, however, the control group gave higher ratings when evaluating the quality of instructions. The MR system's assessment showed less usability, with a cumulative SUS (system usability scale) score of 56.6 (lower half) as well as a cumulative score of 24.2 +/- 7.3 (n = 52) out of 100 in the NASA task load index.CONCLUSIONS: MR is a promising tool for instructing practical skills, and has the potential to enable superior learning outcomes.

First experiences with patient-centered training in virtual reality,"Serrano, C. M.; Wesselink, P. R.; Vervoorn, J. M.","CONTEXT: In preclinical dental education, plastic and extracted teeth have been broadly used for skills training without specific focus on the patient behind the procedure. A patient-centered approach remains challenging in traditional simulation, which does not resemble realistic clinical situations.OBJECTIVE: This article describes the development and first experiences with a patient-centered virtual reality training module (PC-VR) that allows dental care providers to prepare, beforehand and in virtual reality (VR), specific procedures required by their patients. Experiences with this patient-centered practice are described to reflect on its value for clinical training in dentistry.DESIGN: Using an intraoral scanner, digital impressions of 10 patients were made; these served as stereolithography (STL) digital files, which were converted into volumetric haptic models for display in a VR dental simulator. In this study, students' experiences were investigated through a short open-answer survey in 2018. Atlas.ti was used for qualitative analysis of the answers through the inductive methodology of the grounded theory approach.RESULTS: Drillable virtual models of real patients were made available for training using VR. Inductive analysis of the experiences identified 5 dimensions describing the main features of PC-VR: added value, competence development, self-efficacy, outcomes, and room for development.CONCLUSION: This article provides a general overview of the possibilities and challenges of the implementation PC-VR in dental education.

The software can be executed for any robotic surgery platform. Specifically, we tested the simulation under windows environment on the RobotiX Mentor.RESULT: Using urethrovesical anastomosis during radical prostatectomy simulation as a representative example, we present a task-based methodological approach to PSS training. The methodology provides tasks in increasing levels of difficulty from a novice level of basic anatomy identification, to an expert level that permits testing new surgical approaches.CONCLUSION: The modular methodology presented here can be easily extended to support more complex tasks.

Virtual reality technology is one of the most promising surgical planning tools. It can perform fast three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other imaging data sets under conditions of virtual reality (VR). Surgical simulation can more intuitively understand the anatomical relationship of the surgical area in significantly greater detail.METHODS: Thirty clinical undergraduates from the class of 2016 were randomly divided into two groups: the traditional teaching group and the virtual reality teaching group. After the study concluded, the teaching effectiveness was evaluated by combining basic theoretical knowledge, case analysis and questionnaire survey methods.RESULTS: Comparative analysis between both groups showed the response effect of the virtual reality teaching group was better than that of the traditional teaching group (P < 0.05). There was also no difference between both groups in terms of the design of the surgical approach and the listing of surgical matters that required attention (P > 0.05). The results of theoretical knowledge assessment between both groups showed that the scores of basic theory, location, adjacent structure, clinical manifestation, diagnosis and analysis, surgical methods and total scores in the VR group exceeded those in the traditional teaching group (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that VR technology might improve neurosurgical skull base teaching quality, which should be promoted in the teaching of clinical subjects.",2020,,BMC medical education,20,1,3,31900135,,,#9215,Shao 2020,,
A Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence for Communication Skills Training in Nursing Education: Development Study,"Shorey, S.; Ang, E.; Yap, J.; Ng, E. D.; Lau, S. T.; Chui, C. K.","BACKGROUND: The ability of nursing undergraduates to communicate effectively with health care providers, patients, and their family members is crucial to their nursing professions as these can affect patient outcomes. However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings.METHODS: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D.RESULTS: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training.CONCLUSIONS: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.",2019,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,21,10,e14658,31663857,,,#9243,Shorey 2019,,

More than 90% of them indicated ""neutral"" and above in terms of efficacy, attitude, and confidence level with Cronbach's alpha values exceeding .90.CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality offers promising potential as an alternative clinical experience to physical simulation for nursing students to increase their efficacy, attitude, and level of confidence as scrub nurses in a perioperative environment through a standardized scenario-based digital environment.",2022,,Nursing Forum,31,,31,35908236,,,#9251,Siah 2022,,
OpenEar Image Data Enables Case Variation in High Fidelity Virtual Reality Ear Surgery,"Sieber, D. M.; Andersen, S. A. W.; Sorensen, M. S.; Mikkelsen, P. T.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) simulation is an established option for temporal bone surgical training. Most VR simulators are based on computed tomography imaging, whereas the Visible Ear Simulator (VES) is based on high-fidelity cryosections of a single temporal bone specimen. Recently published OpenEar datasets combine cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and micro-slicing to achieve similar model quality. This study explores integration of OpenEar datasets into VES to enable case variation in simulation with implications for patient-specific modeling based on CBCT.METHODS: The OpenEar dataset consists of segmented, coregistered, multimodal imaging sets of human temporal bones. We derived drillable bone segments from the dataset as well as triangulated surface models of critical structures such as facial nerve or dura. Realistic visualization was achieved using coloring from micro-slicing, custom tinting, and texture maps. Resulting models were validated by clinical experts.RESULTS: Six of the eight OpenEar datasets could be integrated in VES complete with instructional guides for various temporal bone surgical procedures. Resulting models were of high quality because of postprocessing steps taken to increase realism including colorization and imaging artifact removal. Bone artifacts were common in CBCT, resulting in dehiscences that most often could not be found in the ground truth micro-slicing data.CONCLUSION: New anatomy models are included in VES version 3.5 freeware and provide case variation for training which could help trainees to learn more quickly and transferably under variable practice conditions. The use of CBCT for VR simulation models without postprocessing results in bone artifacts, which should be considered when using clinical imaging for patient-specific simulation, surgical rehearsal, and planning.",2021,,Otology & Neurotology,42,8,1245-1252,33883519,,,#9257,Sieber 2021,,
An Interactive Holographic Curriculum for Urogynecologic Surgery,"Siff, L.

Evaluation of a novel universal robotic surgery virtual reality simulation proficiency index that will allow comparisons of users across any virtual reality simulation curriculum,"Simmonds, C.; Brentnall, M.; Lenihan, J.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: Evaluate a universal proficiency metric for Robotic Surgery Virtual Reality (VR) simulation that will allow comparison of all users across any VR curriculum.DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of VR Simulation metrics.SETTING: Two training institutions.PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Residents, fellows and practicing surgeons.INTERVENTIONS: Analysis of the Mimic robotic Virtual Reality (VR)-Simulation database of over 600,000 sessions was utilized to calculate Mean scores for each exercise. Those Mean scores were then normalized to 100. Subject's scores were also averaged and normalized to 100. We called this Index score the MScore Proficiency Index (MPI<sup>©</sup>). Scores above 100 were better than average; Less than 100 were worse than average.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen thousand six hundred and forty eight sessions were analyzed (2017-2020) comparing 77 students (residents to practicing surgeons) working in 7 different curriculums. On average, each student spent 8 h and 24 min on simulation, attempted 26.5 different exercises, and became proficient in 20.6 exercises per user. The MPI<sup>©</sup> mean score for all participants in all curricula was an MPI<sup>©</sup> of 104.9 (SD: 15.5). Thirteen students were 1 standard deviation below the norm with an average MPI<sup>©</sup> of 80.15. This group averaged 9 h 27 min each on the simulator attempting 23.46 exercises but becoming proficient in only 10.38 (47%) of them in 224 sessions.

Deteriorating Patient Training Using Nonimmersive Virtual Reality: A Descriptive Qualitative Study,"Singleton, H.; James, J.; Penfold, S.; Falconer, L.; Priego-Hernandez, J.; Holley, D.; Burden, D.","Recent nurse education pedagogical strategies are starting to embrace the use of virtual patient simulations in higher education settings. This study evaluated student, simulation technician, and lecturer perspectives on student performance after virtual training for care of a deteriorating diabetic patient. Second year nursing students learned using a virtual patient simulation, which was a follow-up of a randomized controlled trial that took place during the academic year 2017-2018. Group and individual interviews were conducted comprising the 21 staff and students involved in the virtual reality simulation in four individual lecture sessions. Five themes emerged from this study: engagement, immersion, confidence, knowledge, and challenges. Student participants found that the virtual reality exercise aided their understanding of the complex concepts associated with hypoglycemia, provided immediate feedback about their clinical decisions, could be completed multiple times, and provided more opportunities for safe practice, complimenting their ward and clinical skills experiences.

Virtual simulation training: Imaged experience of dementia,"Slater, P.; Hasson, F.; Gillen, P.; Gallen, A.; Parlour, R.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The need to provide an empathic response to the care of people with dementia has long been advocated. Virtual reality-based programmes continue to gain momentum across health sectors, becoming an innovative tool that provides staff with the opportunity to experience a dementia-like experience within a relatively short time frame. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of an interactive training experience on moral, emotive, behavioural and cognitive elements of empathy.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative exploratory design was adopted employing purposive sampling to identify participants, aged over 18 years, who participated in the Virtual Dementia Tour (VDT R) programme. Interviews were conducted over a two-month period, and qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.RESULTS: The four components (moral, emotive, behavioural and cognitive) of empathy were reflected in findings. Overall the interactive training programme was perceived as useful, and emotionally, it provided an opportunity to ""imagine what it is to live with dementia,"" enabling a cognitive, moral and behavioural reflection to occur, enhancing the empathic state.DISCUSSION: In this study, the VDT R provides a different way of learning, with participants reporting the emergence of an empathic response. Results suggest that the emotional response laid the foundations to the behavioural or cognitive (objective and subjective) reaction which was underpinned by a moral reaction.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Virtual reality programmes are one step in the process for healthcare professionals caring empathetically for people with dementia; however, further research is required.",2019,,International journal of older people nursing,14,3,e12243,31070851,,,#9288,Slater 2019,,

Effect of virtual versus traditional education on theoretical knowledge and reporting skills of dental students in radiographic interpretation of bony lesions of the jaw,"Soltanimehr, E.; Bahrampour, E.; Imani, M. M.; Rahimi, F.; Almasi, B.; Moattari, M.","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the effect of virtual and traditional education on theoretical knowledge and reporting skills of dental students in radiographic interpretation of bony lesions of the jaw.METHODS: This experimental study evaluated 39 dental students who had not received any instruction regarding radiographic interpretation of bony lesions of the jaw. They were randomly divided into two groups of virtual (n = 20) and traditional education (n = 19) and matched in terms of their grade point average (GPA). The virtual group received a virtual learning package while the traditional group received traditional classroom instruction for 6 one-hour sessions. Similar contents were taught to both groups by the same mentor. All students participated in a theoretical test with multiple-choice questions and an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Similar exams were also held 2 months later to assess knowledge retention. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-test and repeated measures ANOVA.RESULTS: The mean scores of theoretical test (P < 0.05) and OSCE (P > 0.05) in the virtual education group (16.60 +/- 0.91 and 15.13 +/- 0.78) were higher than those in the traditional education group (14.89 +/- 0.99 and 14.71 +/- 0.92). In both methods of instruction, the mean scores of theoretical test and OSCE at 2 months were lower than the scores acquired immediately after instruction but this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).

[Augmented reality and virtual reality in the operating theatre status quo und quo vadis],"Sparwasser, P. M.; Schoeb, D.; Miernik, A.; Borgmann, H.","INTRODUCTION: Virtual reality (VR) is an artificially simulated environment permitting interaction. On the other hand, augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of reality created by the use of technology to overlay digital information on an image of something being viewed through a device. Both technologies have partially been implemented in clinical daily routine. Surgical applications of VR and AR are currently evaluated. Yet it is still unclear which possibilities these new and versatile applications offer for physicians.INTENTION: The goal of this article was to assess current and future use of AR und VR, with a special focus on surgery. We also summarised obstacles for AR and VR use as well as potential clinical improvements through these new technologies.METHODS: Systematic literature research in PubMed with inclusion of reviews referring to AR and VR, especially focused on articles on surgery. Keywords were Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Telementoring and Telesurgery. Furthermore we briefly analysed the investment volume and investment strategy in medicine from the ten largest private technology companies of the USA.RESULTS: The keyword ""Augmented Reality"" leads to 1222 articles and 119 reviews, while ""Virtual Reality"" offered 7766 articles and 878 reviews. In recent years, the amount of published articles has increased. 45 articles were included. Multiple AR- and VR-applications are already integrated in surgical daily routine. The next promising applications will concern the possibility of intraoperative overlap with radiological imaging via AR-tools, as well as telementoring and the use of AR and VR in surgical and anatomical education. The expected - but unproven - advantages include cost savings, reduction in complications, comprehensive knowledge acquisition and improvement in surgical results. In addition, we notice enormous financial investment by technology companies in this sector.CONCLUSION: Due to their tremendous potential, AR and VR technologies will be increasingly integrated into surgery. However, the benefit of these new technologies for relevant endpoints are currently unclear. This should be examined in rigorous clinical trials. Physicians should play a key role in this technological revolution to exploit the potential of AR and VR for their patients.",2018,,Aktuelle Urologie,49,6,500-508,30522160,,,#9330,Sparwasser 2018,,
A 'mixed reality' simulator concept for future Medical Emergency Response Team training,"Stone, R. J.; Guest, R.; Mahoney, P.; Lamb, D.; Gibson, C.","The UK Defence Medical Service's Pre-Hospital Emergency Care (PHEC) capability includes rapid-deployment Medical Emergency Response Teams (MERTs) comprising tri-service trauma consultants, paramedics and specialised nurses, all of whom are qualified to administer emergency care under extreme conditions to improve the survival prospects of combat casualties. The pre-deployment training of MERT personnel is designed to foster individual knowledge, skills and abilities in PHEC and in small team performance and cohesion in 'mission-specific' contexts. Until now, the provision of airborne pre-deployment MERT training had been dependent on either the availability of an operational aircraft (eg, the CH-47 Chinook helicopter) or access to one of only two ground-based facsimiles of the Chinook's rear cargo/passenger cabin. Although MERT training has high priority, there will always be competition with other military taskings for access to helicopter assets (and for other platforms in other branches of the Armed Forces).

One important real-world skill that nursing students must acquire is generating accurate handoff communication reports. The central aim of this study was to build, assess, and revise a virtual experience simulation that allows nursing students to observe a standardized clinical situation in an immersive environment and then practice the situation-background-assessment-recommendation communication method. This between-groups experimental study, which was modified in light of COVID-19 concerns, evaluated how well 69 prelicensure nursing students understood a handoff communication report after viewing a virtual human patient and nurse interact during a triage assessment scenario. Results indicate student comprehension levels did not differ based on which of two metacognitive learning strategies was used. Participants in both study groups were able to accurately complete a situation-background-assessment-recommendation instrument based on the virtual experience. Further, they believed that watching a virtual nurse perform a triage assessment would help them perform one themselves in a similar virtual environment. There was also an unexpected study finding related to patient safety within the context of the simulation. This finding warrants further research that will lead to revision of the virtual experience used to train future nurses.",2021,,"CIN: Computers, Informatics, Nursing",39,12,1017-1026,34029264,,,#9385,Stuart 2021,,
Training effect of using Touch Surgery for intramedullary femoral nailing,"Sugand, K.; Mawkin, M.; Gupte, C.","BACKGROUND: Simulation in orthopaedic training is becoming increasingly popular and has been widely used in formal curricula. However, these resources are expensive and not easily accessible to every trainee. Other means of disseminating surgical education through virtual reality (VR) multimedia can act as useful adjunct to traditional methods of teaching. One validated VR platform is Touch Surgery, a cognitive task simulation and rehearsal app.OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to identify the training effect of Touch Surgery intramedullary femoral nailing (IFN) modules using objective performance metrics over six consecutive attempts. Secondary objectives consisted of validated multiple choice questions (MCQ) testing before the first (pre) and after the sixth (post) attempts.METHODS: 27 medical undergraduates were recruited to complete the decision-making process six consecutive times for four modules on the procedural steps of IFN. The modules consisted of (i) preparing the patient and equipment, (ii) femoral canal preparation, (iii) nail insertion and proximal locking, and (iv) distal locking and closure. Real-time objective performance metrics were obtained, stored electronically and analysed using the median and Bonett-Price 95% confidence intervals from the participants' attempts to assess training effect. Significance was calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test for independent data whilst the Wilcoxon signed ranked test was used for paired data. Significance was set as 2-tailed p-value <0.05.RESULTS: Median performance scores per attempt for all four modules demonstrated a significant improvement ranging from 58 to 115%. Scoring variability and distribution was reduced and more predictable per attempt. Logarithmic learning curves elicited strong positive correlations between the number of attempts and scoring. Mean scores for pre and post-study MCQs tests significantly improved from 83 to 94% in all modules.CONCLUSION: IFN modules on Touch Surgery app demonstrated a significant training effect with practice. Novices demonstrated cognitive competencies to ensure patient safety prior to operating.

A.; Carrington, R.; Hart, A.; van Duren, B. H.","BACKGROUND: FluoroSim, a novel fluoroscopic simulator, can be used to practice dynamic hip screw (DHS) guidewire insertion in a high-fidelity clinical scenario. Our aim was to demonstrate a training effect in undergraduate medical students who are not familiar with this operation and its simulation.METHODS: Forty-five undergraduate medical students were recruited and randomized to either training (n = 23) or control (n = 22) cohorts. The training cohort had more exposure to FluoroSim (5 attempts each week) over a 2-week period (with a 1-week washout period in between) compared with the control cohort (a single attempt 1 week apart) over a 2-week period. Five real-time objective performance metrics were recorded: (1) tip-apex distance (TAD) (mm), (2) predicted cut-out rate (%), (3) total procedural time (sec), (4) total number of radiographs (n), and (5) total number of guidewire retries (n).RESULTS: At baseline, there was no significant difference in the performance metrics, which confirmed the absence of a selection bias. The intragroup training effect demonstrated a significant improvement in all metrics for the training cohort only. A significant difference between groups was demonstrated as the training cohort significantly outperformed the control cohort in 3 metrics (procedural time [25%], number of radiographs [57%], and number of guidewire retries [100%]; p < 0.001). A learning curve showed an inversely proportional correlation between frequency of attempts and procedural time as well as the number of digital fluoroscopic radiographs that were made, indicating the development of psychomotor skills. There was also an improved baseline of the learning curve after the 1-week washout period, suggesting skill retention.CONCLUSIONS: Skill acquisition with the FluoroSim system was demonstrated with repeat exposure in a safe, radiation-free high-fidelity clinical simulation with actual operating room equipment. The task of DHS guidewire insertion requires cognitive and psychomotor skills that take a variable number of attempts to acquire, as demonstrated on the learning curve. Additional work is required to demonstrate that the skill tested by the FluoroSim is the same skill that is required for intraoperative DHS guidewire insertion. However, use of the FluoroSim provides improvement in skills with extra-clinical training opportunities for orthopaedic trainees.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: FluoroSim has demonstrated validity and training effect. It has the potential to be approved for possible use on patients in the operating room to help surgeons with the operation. Consequently, operating time, accuracy of TAD, and surgical outcomes may all be improved.",2019,,Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery - American Volume,101,17,e88,31483408,,,#9399,Sugand 2019,,

This study hypothesized that using AR to train for central venous access is superior to using ultrasound alone.METHODS: This study used an AR central venous catheterization phantom with an internal jugular vein (IJV) and subclavian vein (SCV) made of resin body and soft tubing. Ten radiologists attempted to punctuate, using needle placement simulation, under three conditions (ultrasound-, augmented reality-, and ultrasound and AR-guided methods; US-only, AR-only, and US+AR, respectively) using a smart-glass device (HoloLens, Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Subjective (anatomical understanding and self-confidence for procedure) and objective evaluations (optimized needle position and time) were recorded for each condition.RESULTS: The subjective IJV evaluation showed no difference among the guiding methods (p = 0.26 and p = 0.07 for anatomical understanding and self-confidence for procedure, respectively). Conversely, there were significant improvements in subjective and objective evaluations for SCV using the AR-only and US+AR methods (p < 0.05) and US+AR method (p < 0.05), respectively. The AR-only method reduced the time required to fix the needle position to puncture the SCV (p < 0.05), but its objective evaluation did not improve compared with the US-only method (p = 0.20).CONCLUSION: Adding the AR-guided method to the US-guided method improved subjective and objective evaluations in the SVC procedure. The AR technology-assisted training may be more beneficial for use in difficult procedures.

A brief intervention using a virtual learning environment with TeamSTEPPS( R)-based scenarios is described.METHOD: Using a pretest-posttest design, the effects on teamwork attitudes in 109 health professional students from two institutions and multiple disciplines were measured using the TeamSTEPPS Teamwork Attitudes questionnaire.RESULTS: Participants showed significant attitude changes in the categories of leadership, situation monitoring, mutual support, and communication (p .05), with significance in four of the six indicator attitudes in the communication section at the p .001 level.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate the potential impact that virtual learning experiences may have on teamwork attitudes in learners across professions on multiple campuses.",2016,,Journal of Nursing Education,55,1,31-5,26812380,,,#9429,Sweigart 2016,,
Augmented reality in neurosurgery,"Tagaytayan, R.; Kelemen, A.; Sik-Lanyi, C.","Neurosurgery is a medical specialty that relies heavily on imaging. The use of computed tomography and magnetic resonance images during preoperative planning and intraoperative surgical navigation is vital to the success of the surgery and positive patient outcome. Augmented reality application in neurosurgery has the potential to revolutionize and change the way neurosurgeons plan and perform surgical procedures in the future. Augmented reality technology is currently commercially available for neurosurgery for simulation and training. However, the use of augmented reality in the clinical setting is still in its infancy. Researchers are now testing augmented reality system prototypes to determine and address the barriers and limitations of the technology before it can be widely accepted and used in the clinical setting.",2018,,Archives of Medical Science,14,3,572-578,29765445,,,#9438,Tagaytayan 2018,,
Impact of virtual simulation in self-care therapeutics course on introductory pharmacy practice experience self-care encounters,"Tai, M. H.; Rida, N.; Klein, K. C.; Diez, H.; Wells, T.; Kippes, K.; Walker, P. C.; Vordenberg, S. E.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pharmacy education programs use simulation to provide a realistic and safe environment for student learning. We studied whether incorporation of virtual simulation into a required first year self-care therapeutics course impacted frequency of interactions, self-reported student confidence, and preceptor-reported student performance during second-year community pharmacy introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPEs).EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING: Virtual simulation cases using MyDispense were incorporated into a self-care therapeutics course in winter 2017. Students and preceptors were surveyed at the end of the fall semester community pharmacy IPPE. Data from IPPE experiences was compared with students who took the self-care therapeutics course in winter 2016 (control).FINDINGS: Students completed 30 virtual simulation cases and three cases as part of the final examination (n=33). Students in the intervention group reported more patient care interactions during their IPPEs than students who did not complete virtual simulation cases, but there was no difference in self-reported confidence. Preceptors did not report any differences in the ability of students to complete over-the-counter medication interactions during IPPEs.SUMMARY: Cases were well received by students although they took longer to complete than initially anticipated. Students in the intervention group reported significantly more patient care interactions during IPPEs than those in the control group; however, there were no differences in self-reported confidence. Incorporation of virtual simulation was a sustainable change as the cases were able to be re-used the following year with minimal edits.",2020,,Currents in Pharmacy Teaching & Learning,12,1,74-83,31843168,,,#9440,Tai 2020,,
Virtual Laparoscopic Training System Based on VCH Model,"Tang, J.; Xu, L.; He, L.; Guan, S.; Ming, X.; Liu, Q.","Laparoscopy has been widely used to perform abdominal surgeries, as it is advantageous in that the patients experience lower post-surgical trauma, shorter convalescence, and less pain as compared to traditional surgery. Laparoscopic surgeries require precision; therefore, it is imperative to train surgeons to reduce the risk of operation. Laparoscopic simulators offer a highly realistic surgical environment by using virtual reality technology, and it can improve the training efficiency of laparoscopic surgery. This paper presents a virtual Laparoscopic surgery system. The proposed system utilizes the Visible Chinese Human (VCH) to construct the virtual models and simulates real-time deformation with both improved special mass-spring model and morph target animation. Meanwhile, an external device that integrates two five-degrees-of-freedom (5-DOF) manipulators was designed and made to interact with the virtual system. In addition, the proposed system provides a modular tool based on Unity3D to define the functions and features of instruments and organs, which could help users to build surgical training scenarios quickly. The proposed virtual laparoscopic training system offers two kinds of training mode, skills training and surgery training. In the skills training mode, the surgeons are mainly trained for basic operations, such as laparoscopic camera, needle, grasp, electric coagulation, and suturing. In the surgery-training mode, the surgeons can practice cholecystectomy and removal of hepatic cysts by guided or non-guided teaching.",2017,,Journal of Medical Systems,41,4,58,28247305,,,#9461,Tang 2017,,
Comparison study of the use of 360-degree video and non-360-degree video simulation and cybersickness symptoms in undergraduate healthcare curricula,"Taylor, N.; Layland, A.","The increasing use of emerging technologies in healthcare simulation, particularly virtual reality, has caused in increase in both use and misuse. It is the exploration and study of these types of technology that are key to their success-or failure-in simulation learning and teaching. Therefore, this exploratory study evaluated the most common perceived side effect of virtual reality, that of cybersickness. A total of n=60 undergraduate healthcare students participated in one of four identical learning outcome simulation events, using different simulation techniques. This study compared these four common simulation tools, high-fidelity manikin, standardised patient, video case study and 360-degree virtual reality video, and analysed the self-reported cybersickness symptoms. The results show that some virtual reality tools, in this case 360-degree video, are no more likely to provoke cybersickness symptoms than the other simulation methods used in this study. In addition, virtual reality is reported as less fatiguing than other methods of simulation learning. Virtual reality technologies may be a useful addition to the spectrum of simulation tools and techniques currently in use. This study suggests that there is no greater risk of cybersickness symptoms and this potential barrier to use is not borne out by this study.",2019,,BMJ Simulation & Technology Enhanced Learning,5,3,170-173,35514941,,,#9482,Taylor 2019,Shannon Bailey (2023-03-15 04:58:29)(Screen): not learning or performance outcomes ; ,
A High-Fidelity Hybrid Virtual Reality Simulator of Aneurysm Clipping Repair With Brain Sylvian Fissure Exploration for Vascular Neurosurgery Training,"Teodoro-Vite, S.; Perez-Lomeli, J. S.; Dominguez-Velasco, C. F.; Hernandez-Valencia, A. F.; Capurso-Garcia, M. A.; Padilla-Castaneda, M. A.","INTRODUCTION: Microsurgery clipping is one of the most challenging surgical interventions in neurosurgery. The opportunities to train residents are scarce, but the need for accumulating practice is mandatory. New simulating tools are needed for skill learning.METHODS: The design, implementation, and assessment of a new hybrid aneurysm clipping simulator are presented. It consists of an ergonomic workstation with a patient head mannequin and a physics-based virtual reality simulation with bimanual haptic feedback. The simulator recreates scenarios of microsurgery from the patient fixation and the exploration of the brain lobes through Sylvian fissure and vascular structures to the aneurysm clipping. Skill metrics were introduced, including monitoring of gestures movements, exerted forces, tissue displacements, and precision in clipping.RESULTS: Two experimental conditions were tested: (1) simple clipping without brain tissue exploration and (2) clipping the aneurysm with brain Sylvian fissure exploration. Differences in the bimanual gestures were observed between both conditions. The quantitative measurements of tissue displacement of the brain lobes exhibited more tissue retrieval for the surgical gestures of neurosurgeons. Appraisal with questionnaires showed positive scores by neurosurgeons in all items evaluating the usability and realism of the simulator.CONCLUSIONS: The simulator was well accepted and feasible for training purposes. The analysis of the interactions with virtual tissues offers information to establish differential and common patterns between tested groups and thus useful metrics for skill evaluation of practitioners. Future work can lead to other tasks during the intervention and the inclusion of more clinical cases.",2021,,Simulation in Healthcare: The Journal of The Society for Medical Simulation,16,4,285-294,32701862,,,#9493,Teodoro-Vite 2021,,

Virtual patients as a tool for training pre-registration pharmacists and increasing their preparedness to practice: A qualitative study,"Thompson, J.; White, S.; Chapman, S.","Virtual patients are an active learning pedagogical tool which simulate clinical scenarios in a three-dimensional environment. Their use in pharmacy education is under-researched in comparison to other healthcare professions. In the United Kingdom, pre-registration training refers to a year of workplace based training which pharmacy graduates must complete prior to professional registration as pharmacists. This study aimed to evaluate pre-registration pharmacists' perceptions on the integration, usefulness and enjoyment of completing virtual patient simulations or non-interactive case studies as part of their training. Pre-registration trainees completed three virtual patient simulations or three non-interactive case studies on the topics of: emergency hormonal contraception, renal function and childhood illnesses. Telephone interviews were conducted with twenty pre-registration pharmacists, exploring their perspectives on the use of the virtual patient or non-interactive case studies. Data was analysed using the five-stage framework approach. Four main themes emerged from the data: case study design; usefulness of the case studies as a training tool; support in pre-registration training; utility of the learning tools. Trainees also identified technical issues they had experienced while completing the virtual patient simulations, specifically with keyword recognition. Pre-registration trainees who used the virtual patients provided comments relating to the novelty, realism and enjoyment in completing them. Trainees in both groups reported developing knowledge and skills from completing the case studies; those who used the virtual patient commented on the development of communication skills and an increase in confidence for practice and those who used the non-interactive cases focused on knowledge acquisition and numeracy. Participants were enthusiastic about virtual patients as a novel training tool which provided an opportunity for learners to practice realistic scenarios in a safe environment. Virtual patients offer the potential to 'bridge the gap' in pharmacist pre-registration sector-related training variation, promote learning through reflection on doing and increase overall preparedness for practice.",2020,,PLoS ONE [Electronic Resource],15,8,e0238226,32866197,,,#9514,Thompson 2020,,
High correlation between performance on a virtual-reality simulator and real-life cataract surgery,"Thomsen, A. S.; Smith, P.; Subhi, Y.; Cour, M.; Tang, L.; Saleh, G. M.; Konge, L.","PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation in performance of cataract surgery between a virtual-reality simulator and real-life surgery using two objective assessment tools with evidence of validity.METHODS: Cataract surgeons with varying levels of experience were included in the study. All participants performed and videorecorded three standard cataract surgeries before completing a proficiency-based test on the EyeSi virtual-reality simulator. Standard cataract surgeries were defined as: (1) surgery performed under local anaesthesia, (2) patient age >60 years, and (3) visual acuity >1/60 preoperatively. A motion-tracking score was calculated by multiplying average path length and average number of movements from the three real-life surgical videos of full procedures. The EyeSi test consisted of five abstract and two procedural modules: intracapsular navigation, antitremor training, intracapsular antitremor training, forceps training, bimanual training, capsulorhexis and phaco divide and conquer.RESULTS: Eleven surgeons were enrolled. After a designated warm-up period, the proficiency-based test on the EyeSi simulator was strongly correlated to real-life performance measured by motion-tracking software of cataract surgical videos with a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.70 (p = 0.017).CONCLUSION: Performance on the EyeSi simulator is significantly and highly correlated to real-life surgical performance.

Initial evaluation of a virtual reality bomb-defusing simulator for development of undergraduate healthcare student communication and teamwork skills,"Tidbury, L.; Jarvis, K.; Bridge, P.","Communication and teamworking skills are essential healthcare professional skills, yet undergraduates exhibit reluctance to engage with group work, especially in interprofessional groups. The aim of the study was to investigate whether a virtual reality bomb-defusing simulator would enable students to gain these skills through an enjoyable and challenging scenario without profession-specific knowledge. Students took it in turns to play the role of the 'Defuser' immersed in a headset, while the rest of the group were 'Experts' with a printed manual, but no sight of the bomb. The task challenged students to relay obscure symbols and instructions to each other rapidly and effectively. A subsequent focus group explored the impact of the simulation on students' perceived learning, engagement and communication skills. The focus group of five multiprofessional healthcare students reported high levels of engagement and satisfaction while highlighting value in developing communication and teamwork. The simulator nurtured initial group dynamics and team bonding. Evaluation data indicated that the intervention facilitated cooperation, team bonding and the development of good communication skills. This method of encouraging communication would fit well into an interprofessional learning session as a useful tool ahead of more technical and clinically based group work.

Augmented Reality in Pediatric Septic Shock Simulation: Randomized Controlled Feasibility Trial,"Toto, R. L.; Vorel, E. S.; Tay, K. E.; Good, G. L.; Berdinka, J. M.; Peled, A.; Leary, M.; Chang, T. P.; Weiss, A. K.; Balamuth, F. B.","BACKGROUND: Septic shock is a low-frequency but high-stakes condition in children requiring prompt resuscitation, which makes it an important target for simulation-based education.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to design and implement an augmented reality app (PediSepsisAR) for septic shock simulation, test the feasibility of measuring the timing and volume of fluid administration during septic shock simulation with and without PediSepsisAR, and describe PediSepsisAR as an educational tool. We hypothesized that we could feasibly measure our desired data during the simulation in 90% of the participants in each group. With regard to using PediSepsisAR as an educational tool, we hypothesized that the PediSepsisAR group would report that it enhanced their awareness of simulated patient blood flow and would more rapidly verbalize recognition of abnormal patient status and desired management steps.METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled feasibility trial with a convenience sample of pediatric care providers at a large tertiary care pediatric center. Participants completed a prestudy questionnaire and were randomized to either the PediSepsisAR or control (traditional simulation) arms. We measured the participants' time to administer 20, 40, and 60 cc/kg of intravenous fluids during a septic shock simulation using each modality. In addition, facilitators timed how long participants took to verbalize they had recognized tachycardia, hypotension, or septic shock and desired to initiate the sepsis pathway and administer antibiotics. Participants in the PediSepsisAR arm completed a poststudy questionnaire. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the median time with event variables between groups.RESULTS: We enrolled 50 participants (n=25 in each arm). The timing and volume of fluid administration were captured in all the participants in each group. There was no statistically significant difference regarding time to administration of intravenous fluids between the two groups. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding time to verbalized recognition of patient status or desired management steps. Most participants in the PediSepsisAR group reported that PediSepsisAR enhanced their awareness of the patient's perfusion.CONCLUSIONS: We developed an augmented reality app for use in pediatric septic shock simulations and demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the volume and timing of fluid administration during simulation using this modality. In addition, our findings suggest that PediSepsisAR may enhance participants' awareness of abnormal perfusion.",2021,,JMIR medical education,7,4,e29899,34612836,,,#9546,Toto 2021,,
Combining virtual reality and 3D-printed models to simulate patient-specific dental operative procedures-A study exploring student perceptions,"Towers, A.; Dixon, J.; Field, J.; Martin, R.; Martin, N.","INTRODUCTION: Students face a number of challenges in translating the skills acquired in pre-clinical simulation environments to the delivery of real patient care. These are particularly emphasised for complex operative procedures such as tooth preparations for indirect restorations. This paper reports student perceptions of a novel approach designed to improving student confidence when undertaking operative procedures on patients for the first time, by providing patient-specific simulation using virtual reality (VR) and 3D-printed models of the student's real clinical case.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Students practised on patient-specific models, in the presence of a clinical tutor, firstly using VR simulation then with 3D-printed models in a clinical skills laboratory. The students then carried out the operative procedure on their patients, on the third occasion of practice. After providing the treatment for their patients, students attended a semi-structured interview to discuss their experiences. The qualitative data were analysed using two forms of inductive analysis.RESULTS: Students most frequently cited: the value of the educator, increased confidence and efficiency during the clinical procedure, improved patient confidence and the complementary benefits of the two simulation modalities. Thematic analysis of participants' responses uncovered five key themes: The value of virtual reality dental simulators The value of clinical skills laboratory simulation with 3D-printed models The value of educator engagement The impact on the clinical procedure and the patient The VR and clinical skills laboratory balance CONCLUSION: This paper reports the early findings of an intervention that improves dental student confidence through the use of patient-specific VR exercises and 3D-printed models. These provided an incremental learning experience for an operative clinical procedure, prior to treatment of the live patient. Early results suggest this is a positive experience for the students, providing a valuable contribution to their confidence and preparedness.",2022,,European Journal of Dental Education,26,2,393-403,34498360,,,#9550,Towers 2022,,
Validation of virtual reality arthroscopy simulator relevance in characterising experienced surgeons,"Tronchot, A.; Berthelemy, J.; Thomazeau, H.; Huaulme, A.; Walbron, P.; Sirveaux, F.; Jannin, P.","BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) simulation is particularly suitable for learning arthroscopy skills. Despite significant research, one drawback often outlined is the difficulty in distinguishing performance levels (Construct Validity) in experienced surgeons. Therefore, it seems adequate to search new methods of performance measurements using probe trajectories instead of commonly used metrics.HYPOTHESIS: It was hypothesized that a larger experience in surgical shoulder arthroscopy would be correlated with better performance on a VR shoulder arthroscopy simulator and that experienced operators would share similar probe trajectories.MATERIALS & METHODS: After answering to standardized questionnaires, 104 trajectories from 52 surgeons divided into 2 cohorts (26 intermediates and 26 experts) were recorded on a shoulder arthroscopy simulator. The procedure analysed was the ""loose body removal"" in a right shoulder joint. 10 metrics were computed on the trajectories including procedure duration, overall path length, economy of motion and smoothness. Additionally, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was computed on the trajectories for unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the surgeons.RESULTS: Experts were significantly faster (Median 70.9s Interquartile range [56.4-86.3] vs. 116.1s [82.8-154.2], p<0.01), more fluid (4.6.10<sup>5</sup>mm.s<sup>-3</sup> [3.1.10<sup>5</sup>-7.2.10<sup>5</sup>] vs. 1.5.10<sup>6</sup>mm.s<sup>-3</sup> [2.6.10<sup>6</sup>-3.5.10<sup>6</sup>], p=0.05), and economical in their motion (19.3mm<sup>2</sup> [9.1-25.9] vs. 33.8mm<sup>2</sup> [14.8-50.5], p<0.01), but there was no significant difference in performance for path length (671.4mm [503.8-846.1] vs 694.6mm [467.0-1090.1], p=0.62). The DTW clustering differentiates two expertise related groups of trajectories with performance similarities, respectively including 48 expert trajectories for the first group and 52 intermediates and 4 expert trajectories for the second group (Sensitivity of 92%, Specificity of 100%). Hierarchical clustering with DTW significantly identified expert operators from intermediate operators and found trajectory similarities among 24/26 experts.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the Construct Validity of the VR shoulder arthroscopy simulator within groups of experienced surgeons. With new types of metrics simply based on the simulator's raw trajectories, it was possible to significantly distinguish levels of expertise. We demonstrated that clustering analysis with Dynamic Time Warping was able to reliably discriminate between expert operators and intermediate operators.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results have implications for the future of arthroscopic surgical training or post-graduate accreditation programs using virtual reality simulation.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III; prospective comparative study.",2021,,"Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research",107,8,103079,34597826,,,#9567,Tronchot 2021,,

Gamification of educational content is one educational modality that has shown effectiveness in a multitude of different contexts to increase learner engagement and retention. Therefore, we created an interactive, educational 360degree virtual reality walkthrough tour using off-the-shelf commercially available 360degree cameras and software of the Transfusion service and Microbiology Laboratories. The process consists of taking multiple 360degree still-images within the space, color-correction, blurring the faces of staff or sensitive information, adding navigation buttons, and other interactive elements. The virtual tours were used for both recruitment and education with further plans to integrate the learning modality into the curriculum. The clerkship is likely to remain as partially or fully as remote learning so such walkthrough tours will continue to remain relevant.

Forty-six students received a live class regarding ZPC and were randomized by electronic sorting into the following 4 groups: VLO Immediate (GIVLOn=9), VLO longitudinal (GLVLOn=15) and two control groups without VLO (GICn=9 and GLCn=13). The immediate groups had access to VLO or a book for 20 min before the ability assessment, whereas the longitudinal groups had access to VLO or a book for 15 days.RESULTS: A pre- and posttest on theoretical knowledge and two laboratory skill tests, evaluated by blinded examiners, were performed regarding zinc phosphate cement manipulation in all groups. The students who used the VLO obtained better results in all the tests performed than the control students. The theoretical posttest showed a significant difference between the longitudinal groups, GLC (6.0 +/- 1.15) and GLVLO (7.33 +/- 1.43). The lower film thickness presented with a significant difference in the VLO groups: (GIC 25 +/- 9.3) and GIVLO (16.24 +/- 5.17); GLC (50 +/- 27.08) and GLVLO (22.5+/-9.65). The higher setting time occurred in the VLO groups, and the immediate group showed a significant difference (GIC 896 +/- 218.90) and GIVLO (1138.5 +/- 177.95).CONCLUSIONS: The ZPC manipulated by the students who used the VLO had better mechanical properties in the laboratory tests.

Modeling Haptic Interactions in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD),"Turkseven, M.; De, S.; Jackson, C. D.; Sawhney, M. S.","The ability to provide realistic haptic feedback is indispensable for virtual-reality (VR) based endoscopic colorectal surgery simulators. Despite its importance, force feedback is commonly simulated by simplified approximations with parameters manually tuned in preliminary evaluations due to the complexity of the dynamics of haptic interaction in colonoscopy interventions. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a particularly challenging intervention that requires advanced manual skills for endoscopic control. This work proposes a mechanical impedance model for haptic interactions in ESD formulated via an experimental methodology applied to endoscopic colorectal interventions in general. The developed model is shown to capture the variations in the interaction force during two operations performed at distinct locations on a porcine sample. Salient cues in the recorded haptic interaction data are presented, and changes in the impedance characteristics of the tool-tissue interaction between the steps of the operation are analyzed.",2022,,IEEE Transactions on Haptics.

On follow-up survey, 95% (n=65) of respondents in the VR group and 98% (n=82) in the video group would use their assigned intervention again.CONCLUSION: eHBB VR training was highly acceptable to healthcare workers in low-income to middle-income countries and may provide additional support for neonatal resuscitation skills retention compared with other digital interventions.",2021,,BMJ Open,11,8,e048506,34433598,,,#9604,Umoren 2021,,
Performance on a Virtual Reality DHS Simulator Correlates with Performance in the Operating Theatre,"Vaghela, K. R.; Lee, J.; Akhtar, K.","INTRODUCTION: Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) fixation of neck of femur fractures is one of the most commonly performed orthopaedic trauma operations. Changes in working practices have impacted surgical training and have resulted in fewer opportunities to perform this procedure. Virtual reality (VR) simulation has been shown to be a valid means of gaining competency, efficiently and safely, without compromising patient safety.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine whether performance on a VR DHS simulator correlates with performance in the operating theatre.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All episodes of DHS fixation of neck of femur fractures performed at Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, level 1 major trauma centre between January 2014 and December 2015 were identified using the hip fracture database. The primary surgeon was identified using the electronic operative notes. The intraoperative fluoroscopic images were accessed and the tip-apex distance (TAD) was measured, as well as the probability of cut-out. The surgeon then performed DHS fixation on a VR DHS simulator and the TAD achieved in theatre was correlated with the simulated TAD.RESULTS: Twenty-five surgeons, including six novices (core surgical trainees), 12 intermediates (specialist registrars), and seven experts (fellows and consultants), completed the study. There was no overall statistically significant difference in TAD between those achieved in the operating theatre and on the simulator for each participant (p=0.688).CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference between performance on a VR DHS simulator and the operating theatre. This suggests that the simulator is excellent for training in this component of the DHS procedure, but further work is needed to assess whether training on the simulator can improve performance in the operating theatre.",2018,,Surgical technology international,33,,20,30029289,,,#9614,Vaghela 2018,,
Evaluation of robotic cardiac surgery simulation training: A randomized controlled trial,"Valdis, M.; Chu, M. W.; Schlachta, C.; Kiaii, B.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the currently available simulation training modalities used to teach robotic surgery.METHODS: Forty surgical trainees completed a standardized robotic 10-cm dissection of the internal thoracic artery and placed 3 sutures of a mitral valve annuloplasty in porcine models and were then randomized to a wet lab, a dry lab, a virtual reality lab, or a control group that received no additional training. All groups trained to a level of proficiency determined by 2 expert robotic cardiac surgeons. All assessments were evaluated using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills in a blinded fashion.RESULTS: Wet lab trainees showed the greatest improvement in time-based scoring and the objective scoring tool compared with the experts (mean, 24.9 +/- 1.7 vs 24.9 +/- 2.6; P = .704). The virtual reality lab improved their scores and met the level of proficiency set by our experts for all primary outcomes (mean, 24.9 +/- 1.7 vs 22.8 +/- 3.7; P = .103). Only the control group trainees were not able to meet the expert level of proficiency for both time-based scores and the objective scoring tool (mean, 24.9 +/- 1.7 vs 11.0 +/- 4.5; P < .001). The average duration of training was shortest for the dry lab and longest for the virtual reality simulation (1.6 hours vs 9.3 hours; P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: We have completed the first randomized controlled trial to objectively compare the different training modalities of robotic surgery. Our data demonstrate the significant benefits of wet lab and virtual reality robotic simulation training and highlight key differences in current training methods. This study can help guide training programs in investing resources in cost-effective, high-yield simulation exercises.",2016,,Journal of Thoracic & Cardiovascular Surgery,151,6,1498-1505.e2,26964911,,,#9619,Valdis 2016,,

Validation of Simendo Knee Arthroscopy Virtual Reality Simulator,"van der Heijden, L. L. M.; Reijman, M.; van der Steen, M. C. M.; Janssen, R. P. A.; Tuijthof, G. J. M.","PURPOSE: To determine the face and construct validity as well as educational value and user-friendliness of the Simendo knee arthroscopy virtual reality simulator.METHODS: Sixty participants were recruited and equally divided into novices (0 arthroscopic procedures), intermediates (1-59 arthroscopic procedures), and experts (60 or more arthroscopic procedures). Participants were excluded if they had previously trained with the studied simulator. Construct validity, that is, the ability to discriminate between different levels of expertise, was examined by a navigation task. All participants were asked to perform 5 navigation trials within 10 minutes. Face validity, educational value, and user-friendliness were examined by questionnaires before and after the navigation trials. Face validity is the subjective impression of how closely the simulation replicates the real environment.RESULTS: The novices were significantly slower than the intermediates in the first (P < .001) and the third (P = .031) trial. The novices were significantly slower than the experts in all trials (P = .016), except for the fifth (P = .054). The experts were significantly faster than the intermediates in every trial except for the fourth (P = .069). Median task time for the fifth trial was 63 seconds (44-80 seconds) for novices, 58 seconds (46-80 seconds) for intermediates, and 41 seconds (33-55 seconds) for experts. Ninety-two percent of all participants agreed that the simulator can be used to train for surgical inspection, and 95% indicated sufficient user-friendliness.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, this knee simulator can be applied to train the basic arthroscopic hand-eye coordination skills at the start of resident education programs. Further testing is necessary to determine whether the skills are retained.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The simulator is partly validated, which contributes to training of basic arthroscopic skills without compromising patient safety.",2019,,Arthroscopy,35,8,2385-2390,31053458,,,#9631,vanderHeijden 2019,,

VR and machine learning: novel pathways in surgical hands-on training,"Veneziano, D.; Cacciamani, G.; Rivas, J. G.; Marino, N.; Somani, B. K.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Surgical training has dramatically changed over the last decade. It has become not only the way to prepare surgeons for their everyday work, but also a way to certify their skills thus increasing patient safety. This article reviews advances in the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence applied to virtual reality based surgical training over the last 5 years.RECENT FINDINGS: Eight articles have been published which met the inclusion criteria. This included six articles about the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for assessment purposes and two articles about the possibility of teaching applications, including one review and one original research article. All the research articles pointed out the importance of machine learning and artificial intelligence for the stratification of trainees, based on their performance on basic tasks or procedures simulated in a virtual reality environment.SUMMARY: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are designed to analyse data and use them to take decisions that typically require human intelligence. Evidence in literature is still scarce about this technology applied to virtual reality and existing manuscripts are mainly focused on its potential to stratify surgical performance and provide synthetic feedbacks about it.

Touch Surgery (TS) (Kinosis Limited, London, United Kingdom) is a mobile-based app that combines cognitive task analysis with a virtual reality medium to familiarize the user with a surgical procedure through interactive rehearsal. The purpose of this study was to compare the educational efficacy of the TS app with a traditional paper-based learning program in performing a robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Twelve participants (four interns, four residents, four adult reconstructive fellows) were randomized to a paper-based technique guide or learning modules from the Mako Partial Knee (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ) TS app. Trainees were subjected to a baseline pretest. After preparing with the allocated training tool, participants completed an immediate posttest followed by a retention test administered 3 weeks later. The TS simulation group demonstrated greater improvement (22% score increase; p = 0.001) in posttest assessment compared with the control group (10% score increase; p = 0. 09). The TS simulation group demonstrated better information recall compared with the control group based on the score differential following the 3-week retention test. This randomized comparative study demonstrated that the TS app was better than traditional paper-based learning for both immediate posttest performance and long-term information recall of the Mako robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.

A hands-on educational presence is needed to promote overseas surgical autonomy, build overseas capacity, and ensure a sustained clinical and educational infrastructure. The goal of this study was to build and assess an augmented reality educational platform that allows a remote yet virtual interactive presence to transfer cleft surgery knowledge/skills to overseas colleagues.METHODS: A prospective study assessing a 13-month overseas augmented reality-based cleft surgery curriculum was conducted. Three semiannual site visits engaged two Peruvian surgeons in evidence-based didactics, on-site cleft surgery, and familiarization with the augmented reality platform. During 10 remote augmented reality visits, a surgeon stationed in United States guided the same Peruvian surgeons through cleft surgery. Quarterly assessments of the Peruvian surgeons were performed using visual analogue scale questionnaires.RESULTS: Visual analogue scale scores by both the remote and overseas surgeons demonstrated significant, progressive improvement in all facets of cleft lip repair throughout the curriculum. Site visits preferentially built capacity for cleft diagnosis and preoperative counseling (p < 0.001), principles of repair (p < 0.001), repair technique (p < 0.02) and intraoperative decision-making (p < 0.001). Remote sessions preferentially developed understanding of cleft operative design/anthropometry (p < 0.04), cleft anatomy (p < 0.01), and operative efficiency (p < 0.001). At 30-month follow-up, no children with cleft lip required transfer to tertiary care centers.CONCLUSION: A curriculum that combines on-site training and augmented reality-based hands-on remote teaching can build sustained capacity of comprehensive cleft care in underresourced areas.",2020,,Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery,146,5,622e-629e,33136961,,,#9726,Vyas 2020,,

We conducted a randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of an immersive 3D VR teaching of chemotherapy administration operated in a smartphone coupled with a visual and audio device. We adopted a two-arm single-blind design and recruited 83 nurses, and they were randomized using a cluster approach. The VR group learned chemotherapy administration through VR, while the controlled group learned through document reading. The Knowledge and Attitude of Chemotherapy Administration (KACA) was administrated before the intervention, while the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) and the Checklist of Action Accomplishment (CAA) were administrated one month after the intervention. The VR group scored higher than the controlled group in the CAA (95.69 +/- 5.37 vs. 91.98 +/- 9.31, p = 0.02) and the OSCE (73.07 +/- 10.99 vs. 67.44 +/-10.65, p = 0.02). Stepwise regression demonstrated that service years, an education level of undergraduate or above, and VR exposure contributed positively to the OSCE score (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.194, p = 0.028).

Influence of Virtual Reality Technology on Clinical Thinking Cultivation of Medical Students,"Wang, Y.","Clinical thinking is not only the basis and premise of clinical reasoning and decision-making, but the necessary quality to cultivate reliable, responsible, and emotional excellent doctors. Virtual reality technology provides a real clinical learning environment for medical students, which can bridge the gap between medical theory and medical practice and save educational resources. Virtual reality is helpful to cultivate medical students' clinical thinking and prepare for their clinical practice. Through the deconstruction of clinical thinking, this paper determines the connotation and constituent elements of clinical thinking, puts forward the model framework for virtual reality technology to promote the development of medical students' clinical thinking, and explains the impact of virtual reality technology on the development of medical students' clinical thinking, clinical reasoning, and critical thinking from the aspects of virtual reality situation, teaching activities, and virtual reality characteristics.",2021,,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,2021,,8004883,34422247,,,#9771,Wang 2021,,
The Utility of Virtual Patient Simulations for Clinical Reasoning Education,"Watari, T.; Tokuda, Y.; Owada, M.; Onigata, K.","Virtual Patient Simulations (VPSs) have been cited as a novel learning strategy, but there is little evidence that VPSs yield improvements in clinical reasoning skills and medical knowledge. This study aimed to clarify the effectiveness of VPSs for improving clinical reasoning skills among medical students, and to compare improvements in knowledge or clinical reasoning skills relevant to specific clinical scenarios. We enrolled 210 fourth-year medical students in March 2017 and March 2018 to participate in a real-time pre-post experimental design conducted in a large lecture hall by using a clicker. A VPS program (<sup> R</sup>Body Interact, Portugal) was implemented for one two-hour class session using the same methodology during both years. A pre-post 20-item multiple-choice questionnaire (10 knowledge and 10 clinical reasoning items) was used to evaluate learning outcomes. A total of 169 students completed the program. Participants showed significant increases in average total post-test scores, both on knowledge items (pre-test: median = 5, mean = 4.78, 95% CI (4.55-5.01); post-test: median = 5, mean = 5.12, 95% CI (4.90-5.43); p-value = 0.003) and clinical reasoning items (pre-test: median = 5, mean = 5.3 95%, CI (4.98-5.58); post-test: median = 8, mean = 7.81, 95% CI (7.57-8.05); p-value < 0.001).

Simulation Training Improves Surgical Proficiency and Safety During Diagnostic Shoulder Arthroscopy Performed by Residents,"Waterman, B. R.; Martin, K. D.; Cameron, K. L.; Owens, B. D.; Belmont, P. J., Jr.","Although virtual reality simulators have established construct validity, no studies have proven transfer of skills from a simulator to improved in vivo surgical skill. The current authors hypothesized that simulation training would improve residents' basic arthroscopic performance and safety. Twenty-two orthopedic surgery trainees were randomized into simulation or standard practice groups. At baseline testing, all of the participants performed simulator-based testing and a supervised, in vivo diagnostic shoulder arthroscopy with video recording. The simulation group subsequently received 1 hour of total instruction during a 3-month period, and the standard practice group received no simulator training. After intervention, both groups were reevaluated with simulator testing and a second recorded diagnostic shoulder arthroscopy. Two blinded, independent experts evaluated arthroscopic performance using the anatomic checklist, Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET) score, and total elapsed time. All outcome measures were compared within and between groups. After intervention, mean time required by the simulation group to complete the simulator task (30.64 seconds) was 8+/-1.2 seconds faster than the time required by the control group (38.64 seconds; P=.001). Probe distance (51.65 mm) was improved by 41.2+/-6.08 mm compared with the control (92.83 mm; P=.001). When comparing ASSET safety scores, the simulation group was competent (3.29) and significantly better than the control group (3.00; P=.005) during final arthroscopic testing. This study establishes transfer validity for an arthroscopic shoulder simulator model. Simulator training for residents in training can decrease surgical times, improve basic surgical skills, and confer greater patient safety during shoulder arthroscopy.

FES exam outcomes in year two of a proficiency-based endoscopic skills curriculum,"Weis, J. J.; Scott, D. J.; Busato, L.; Hennessy, S. A.","BACKGROUND: FES certification is required to sit for the ABS Qualifying Exam. Previous work demonstrated a 40% FES pass rate for residents with standard clinical endoscopy training. After implementing a proficiency-based simulation curriculum, our FES pass rate increased to 87%. The purpose of this study was to monitor the success of our curriculum in its second year. We also hypothesized that residents who took the FES exam within 30 days of their clinical endoscopy rotation would have superior pass rates to residents who waited longer.METHODS: PGY4 residents (N = 12) underwent flexible endoscopy training including a 1 month clinical rotation plus proficiency-based simulation training using bench-top models (Trus, Operation Targeting Task) and a virtual reality task on the GI Mentor. Residents that passed FES on their first attempt were compared to residents that did not pass based on number of endoscopies logged, hours spent practicing on simulators, and time elapsed between completing their endoscopy rotation and taking the FES exam. FES total scores and section scores were compared to historical controls.RESULTS: Nine residents (75%) passed FES on their first attempt. Overall, 80% of residents who tested within 30 days of their endoscopy rotation (n = 5) passed FES while 71% of residents who waited longer (n = 7) passed FES (p = non-significant). Residents that passed FES were not significantly different from residents who did not pass based on number of endoscopies logged or hours spent practicing on simulators. Compared to historical controls, scores on loop reduction improved significantly with the new curriculum.CONCLUSIONS: FES pass rates decreased during the second year of our curriculum. Based on other literature, our trainees would benefit from higher volumes of endoscopy and/or a more robust proficiency-based simulation curriculum. Scheduling the FES exam in the month following the endoscopy rotation did not significantly improve pass rates.",2020,,Surgical Endoscopy,34,2,961-966,31197534,,,#9801,Weis 2020,,
Colonoscopy procedure simulation: virtual reality training based on a real time computational approach,"Wen, T.; Medveczky, D.; Wu, J.; Wu, J.","BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy plays an important role in the clinical screening and management of colorectal cancer. The traditional 'see one, do one, teach one' training style for such invasive procedure is resource intensive and ineffective. Given that colonoscopy is difficult, and time-consuming to master, the use of virtual reality simulators to train gastroenterologists in colonoscopy operations offers a promising alternative.METHODS: In this paper, a realistic and real-time interactive simulator for training colonoscopy procedure is presented, which can even include polypectomy simulation. Our approach models the colonoscopy as thick flexible elastic rods with different resolutions which are dynamically adaptive to the curvature of the colon. More material characteristics of this deformable material are integrated into our discrete model to realistically simulate the behavior of the colonoscope.CONCLUSION: We present a simulator for training colonoscopy procedure. In addition, we propose a set of key aspects of our simulator that give fast, high fidelity feedback to trainees. We also conducted an initial validation of this colonoscopic simulator to determine its clinical utility and efficacy.",2018,,BioMedical Engineering Online,17,1,9,29370860,,,#9807,Wen 2018,,

Improved understanding of the person with dementia reduces psychological distress. To enhance understanding and empathy in caregivers, an innovative technology virtual reality intervention Through the D'mentia Lens (TDL) was developed to experience dementia, consisting of a virtual reality simulation movie and e-course. A pilot study of TDL was conducted.METHODS: A pre-test-post-test design was used. Informal caregivers filled out questionnaires assessing person-centeredness, empathy, perceived pressure from informal care, perceived competence and quality of the relationship. At post-test, additional questions about TDL's feasibility were asked.RESULTS: Thirty-five caregivers completed the pre-test and post-test. Most participants were satisfied with TDL and stated that TDL gave more insight in the perception of the person with dementia. The simulation movie was graded 8.03 out of 10 and the e-course 7.66. Participants significantly improved in empathy, confidence in caring for the person with dementia, and positive interactions with the person with dementia.CONCLUSION: TDL is feasible for informal caregivers and seems to lead to understanding of and insight in the experience of people with dementia.

Virtual Reality and Physical Models in Undergraduate Orthopaedic Education: A Modified Randomised Crossover Trial,"Wilson, G.; Zargaran, A.; Kokotkin, I.; Bhaskar, J.; Zargaran, D.; Trompeter, A.","BACKGROUND: Orthopaedic surgery is underrepresented in the United Kingdom medical school curriculum, with an average of less than 3 weeks of exposure over the five-year degree. This study evaluates the effectiveness of high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) and physical model simulation in teaching undergraduate orthopaedic concepts.METHODS: A modified randomised crossover trial was used. Forty-nine students were randomly allocated to two groups, with thirty-three finishing the six-week follow-up assessment. All undergraduate medical students were eligible for inclusion. Both groups were given introductory lectures, before completing a pre-test with questions on the principles of fracture fixation and osteotomy. Each group then received a lecture on these topics with the same content, but one was delivered with VR and the other with physical models. Both groups completed the post-course assessments. Knowledge was assessed by way of questionnaire immediately before, immediately after, and six-weeks after.RESULTS: In the VR group, participants improved their post-training score by 192.1% (U=32; p<0.00001). In the physical models group, participants improved their post-training scores by 163.1% (U=8.5; p<0.00001).

Using Virtual Reality to Compare Design Alternatives Using Subjective and Objective Evaluation Methods,"Wingler, D.; Joseph, A.; Bayramzadeh, S.; Robb, A.","OBJECTIVE: This study sought to develop a method that supports a more evidence-based approach to evaluating multiple design options in virtual reality (VR), combining subjective insights gathered using traditional approaches and objective feedback gathered using the VR platform. Additionally, this study sought to understand how objective data garnered from the VR platform could be used to compliment traditional evaluation strategies.BACKGROUND: VR can be a viable research platform for supporting evidence-based design practices. Prior studies have predominately utilized experiential user feedback. While able to provide valuable subjective insights, these approaches are less effective in making objective comparisons between multiple designs alternatives.METHOD: A repeated measures study was conducted with nursing faculty. User feedback was captured through surveys, interviews, and the VR platform.RESULTS: The survey, interview, and the objective VR data converged in terms of identifying the highest performing design option. Survey data showed that Room 2 performed best in terms of perceived physical access to supplies, unobstructed movement, and availability of space to accommodate additional equipment. VR data showed that participants in Room 2 had significantly higher visibility to both patient and care partners throughout their simulated interaction.CONCLUSION: Simulation-based evaluations in VR that use a combination of users' subjective insights and objective data obtained from VR can be an effective tool for helping designers evaluate multiple design options. The use of scenario-based simulations provided a structured and clinically relevant approach to comparing three preoperative rooms, supporting a more robust assessment of users' physical response to a simulated healthcare environment.",2020,,HERD: Health Environments Research & Design Journal,13,1,129-144,31113251,,,#9848,Wingler 2020,,

Advancements in computer-based simulation provide opportunities to assess cognitive and psychomotor skills in surgically naive populations during complex simulated neurosurgical tasks in risk-free environments. This pilot study was designed to answer 3 questions: (1) What are the differences in bimanual psychomotor performance among neurosurgical residency applicants using NeuroTouch? (2) Are there exceptionally skilled medical students in the applicant cohort? and (3) Is there an influence of previous surgical exposure on surgical performance?DESIGN: Participants were instructed to remove 3 simulated brain tumors with identical visual appearance, stiffness, and random bleeding points. Validated tier 1, tier 2, and advanced tier 2 metrics were used to assess bimanual psychomotor performance. Demographic data included weeks of neurosurgical elective and prior operative exposure.SETTING: This pilot study was carried out at the McGill Neurosurgical Simulation Research and Training Center immediately following neurosurgical residency interviews at McGill University, Montreal, Canada.PARTICIPANTS: All 17 medical students interviewed were asked to participate, of which 16 agreed.RESULTS: Performances were clustered in definable top, middle, and bottom groups with significant differences for all metrics. Increased time spent playing music, increased applicant self-evaluated technical skills, high self-ratings of confidence, and increased skin closures statistically influenced performance on univariate analysis. A trend for both self-rated increased operating room confidence and increased weeks of neurosurgical exposure to increased blood loss was seen in multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Simulation technology identifies neurosurgical residency applicants with differing levels of technical ability.

These advancements may increase the understanding, assessment and training of psychomotor performance. Consequently, the application of machine learning techniques to evaluate performance on virtual reality simulators has led to an increase in the volume and complexity of publications which bridge the fields of computer science, medicine, and education. Although all disciplines stand to gain from research in this field, important differences in reporting exist, limiting interdisciplinary communication and knowledge transfer. Thus, our objective was to develop a checklist to provide a general framework when reporting or analyzing studies involving virtual reality surgical simulation and machine learning algorithms.

Surgical simulation allows for the quantitation of psychomotor skills, generating data sets that can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms.Objective: To identify surgical and operative factors selected by a machine learning algorithm to accurately classify participants by level of expertise in a virtual reality surgical procedure.Design, Setting, and Participants: Fifty participants from a single university were recruited between March 1, 2015, and May 31, 2016, to participate in a case series study at McGill University Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre. Data were collected at a single time point and no follow-up data were collected. Individuals were classified a priori as expert (neurosurgery staff), seniors (neurosurgical fellows and senior residents), juniors (neurosurgical junior residents), and medical students, all of whom participated in 250 simulated tumor resections.Exposures: All individuals participated in a virtual reality neurosurgical tumor resection scenario. Each scenario was repeated 5 times.Main Outcomes and Measures: Through an iterative process, performance metrics associated with instrument movement and force, resection of tissues, and bleeding generated from the raw simulator data output were selected by K-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, discriminant analysis, and support vector machine algorithms to most accurately determine group membership.Results: A total of 50 individuals (9 women and 41 men; mean [SD] age, 33.6 [9.5] years; 14 neurosurgeons, 4 fellows, 10 senior residents, 10 junior residents, and 12 medical students) participated. Neurosurgeons were in practice between 1 and 25 years, with 9 (64%) involving a predominantly cranial practice. The K-nearest neighbor algorithm had an accuracy of 90% (45 of 50), the naive Bayes algorithm had an accuracy of 84% (42 of 50), the discriminant analysis algorithm had an accuracy of 78% (39 of 50), and the support vector machine algorithm had an accuracy of 76% (38 of 50). The K-nearest neighbor algorithm used 6 performance metrics to classify participants, the naive Bayes algorithm used 9 performance metrics, the discriminant analysis algorithm used 8 performance metrics, and the support vector machine algorithm used 8 performance metrics. Two neurosurgeons, 1 fellow or senior resident, 1 junior resident, and 1 medical student were misclassified.Conclusions and Relevance: In a virtual reality neurosurgical tumor resection study, a machine learning algorithm successfully classified participants into 4 levels of expertise with 90% accuracy.

"The Eyesi simulator in training ophthalmology residents: results of a pilot study on self-efficacy, motivation and performance","Wisse, R. P.; Coster, T.; Van der Schaaf, M.; Ten Cate, O.","Purpose: To describe ophthalmology residents' motivation and self-efficacy during cataract surgery training and to assess the relationship of self-efficacy and motivation on both simulator (Eyesi) and real-life surgical performance.Methods: Prospective cohort study using a within-subject design. Eight residents were asked to fill out questionnaires on self-efficacy and motivation towards the Eyesi simulator and real-life cataract surgery at three different moments. Simulator performance was derived from the instrument's output. Patient charts were reviewed to assess real-life surgical performance.Results: Comparative analysis, using a paired sampled t-test, showed a significant increase in self-efficacy towards real-life cataract surgery after completing the cataract training on the simulator (p=0.005). Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between total tasks to complete the cataract training and self-efficacy scored after working with the simulator (p=0.038). Motivation towards the simulator remained stable over time and seemed not to be influenced by simulator or real-life performance.Conclusions: We found evidence that performance on the simulator correlated with residents' self-efficacy scored after the simulator training, supporting the theory that self-efficacy is determined by prior performance. Self-efficacy seemed inversely related to the ease of completion of a task: delivery of a greater effort leads to more satisfaction and a higher perceived self-efficacy towards this particular task. Future studies should include more subjects to provide a more accurate insight in the role of self-efficacy and motivation in training complex surgical skills.",2017,,BMJ Simulation & Technology Enhanced Learning,3,3,111-115,35518903,,,#9855,Wisse 2017,,
Saving robots improves laparoscopic performance: transfer of skills from a serious game to a virtual reality simulator,"I. Jgosse WM; van Goor, H.; Luursema, J. M.","BACKGROUND: Residents find it hard to commit to structural laparoscopic skills training. Serious gaming has been proposed as a solution on the premise that it is effective and more motivating than traditional simulation. We establish construct validity for the laparoscopic serious game Underground by comparing laparoscopic simulator performance for a control group and an Underground training group.METHODS: A four-session laparoscopic basic skills course is part of the medical master students surgical internship at the Radboud University Medical Centre. Four cohorts, representing 107 participants, were assigned to either the Underground group or the control group. The control group trained on the FLS video trainer and the LapSim virtual reality simulator for four sessions. The Underground group played Underground for three sessions followed by a transfer session on the FLS video trainer and the LapSim. To assess the effect of engaging in serious gameplay on performance on two validated laparoscopic simulators, initial performance on the FLS video trainer and the LapSim was compared between the control group (first session) and the Underground group (fourth session).RESULTS: We chose task duration as a proxy for laparoscopic performance. The Underground group outperformed the control group on all three LapSim tasks: Camera navigation F(1) = 12.71, p < .01; Instrument navigation F(1) = 8.04, p < .01; and Coordination F(1) = 6.36, p = .01. There was no significant effect of playing Underground for performance on the FLS video trainer Peg Transfer task, F(1) = 0.28, p = .60.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated skills transfer between a serious game and validated laparoscopic simulator technology. Serious gaming may become a valuable, cost-effective addition to the skillslab, if transfer to the operating room can be established.

Comparing the effectiveness of augmented reality-based and conventional instructions during single ECMO cannulation training,"Wolf, J.; Wolfer, V.; Halbe, M.; Maisano, F.; Lohmeyer, Q.; Meboldt, M.","PURPOSE: Effective training of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation is key to fighting the persistently high mortality rate of ECMO interventions. Though augmented reality (AR) is a promising technology for improving information display, only a small percentage of AR projects have addressed training procedures. The present study investigates the potential benefits of AR-based, contextual instructions for ECMO cannulation training as compared to instructions used during conventional training at a university hospital.METHODOLOGY: An AR step-by-step guide was developed for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 that combines text, images, and videos from the conventional training program with simple 3D models. A study was conducted with 21 medical students performing two surgical procedures on a simulator. Participants were divided into two groups, with one group using the conventional instructions for the first procedure and AR instructions for the second and the other group using instructions in reverse order. Training times, a detailed error protocol, and a standardized user experience questionnaire (UEQ) were evaluated.RESULTS: AR-based execution was associated with slightly higher training times and with significantly fewer errors for the more complex second procedure ([Formula: see text], Mann-Whitney U). These differences in errors were most present for knowledge-related errors, resulting in a 66% reduction in the number of errors. AR instructions also led to significantly better ratings on 5 out of the 6 scales used in the UEQ, pointing to higher perceived clarify of information, information acquisition speed, and stimulation.CONCLUSION: The results extend previous research on AR instructions to ECMO cannulation training, indicating its high potential to improve training outcomes as a result of better information acquisition by participants during task execution. Future work should investigate how better performance in a single training session relates to better performance in the long run.",2021,,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology & Surgery,16,7,1171-1180,34023976,,,#9859,Wolf 2021,,

Intubations were recorded and evaluated using the Global Rating Scale (GRS) and checklist scores. Subsequently, participants were randomised to control group (Group CON) and had no simulation training, or to a simulation group (Group SIM) and underwent 60 min of simulation practice. Within a week, participants performed a second FOB intubation and were similarly evaluated.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pretraining and posttraining intubation time, GRS and checklist scores.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. In Group SIM, there was significant improvement between pre and posttraining GRS [22.9 +/- 8.1 vs. 28.2 +/- 7.3, mean difference (95% CI) 5.3 (0.3 to 10.3), P = 0.04], and intubation time [177.6 +/- 77.6 vs. 119.3 +/- 52.2 s, mean difference (95% CI) -58.4 (-100.3 to -16.5) s, P = 0.01]. There was no difference in Group CON, between pre and posttraining intubation time, GRS or checklist.CONCLUSION: We conclude, posttraining performance of FOB intubation, as measured by intubation time and GRS, improved in Group SIM, while it was unchanged in the Group CON.

N.; Ebert-Allen, R.; Croland, T.","An augmented reality (AR) mobile smartphone application was developed for clinicians to improve their knowledge about the contents and organisation of a standardised paediatric code cart, an important tool in safe, effective paediatric resuscitations. This study used focus groups and interviews with 22 clinicians to identify work system barriers and facilitators to use of the application. We identified twelve dimensions of barriers and facilitators: convenience, device ownership, device size and type, gamification, interface design, movement/physical space, perception of others, spatial presence, technological experience, technological glitches, workload, and the perception and attitude towards code cart and resuscitation. These dimensions can guide improvement efforts, e.g. redesigning the interface, providing non-AR modes, improving the tutorial. We propose nine principles to guide the design of other digital health technologies incorporating AR. In particular, the workload demands created by using AR must be considered and accounted for in the design and implementation of such technologies. <b>Practitioner summary</b>: Augmented reality (AR) may prepare workers for situations that do not occur frequently. This study investigates barriers and facilitators to using an AR mobile smartphone application developed to improve clinician knowledge about code carts, leading to improvements to the application and principles to guide the design of other AR-based technologies.",2022,,Ergonomics,65,3,334-347,34253153,,,#9871,Wooldridge 2022,,
Virtual Simulation in Undergraduate Medical Education: A Scoping Review of Recent Practice,"Wu, Q.; Wang, Y.; Lu, L.; Chen, Y.; Long, H.; Wang, J.","Virtual simulation (VS) as an emerging interactive pedagogical strategy has been paid more and more attentions in the undergraduate medical education. Because of the fast development of modern computer simulation technologies, more and more advanced and emerging VS-based instructional practices are constantly increasing to promote medical education in diverse forms. In order to describe an overview of the current trends in VS-based medical teaching and learning, this scoping review presented a worldwide analysis of 92 recently published articles of VS in the undergraduate medical teaching and learning. The results indicated that 98% of included articles were from Europe, North America, and Asia, suggesting a possible inequity in digital medical education. Half (52%) studies reported the immersive virtual reality (VR) application. Evidence for educational effectiveness of VS in medical students' knowledge or skills was sufficient as per Kirkpatrick's model of outcome evaluation. Recently, VS has been widely integrated in surgical procedural training, emergency and pediatric emergency medicine training, teaching of basic medical sciences, medical radiation and imaging, puncture or catheterization training, interprofessional medical education, and other case-based learning experiences. Some challenges, such as accessibility of VS instructional resources, lack of infrastructure, ""decoupling"" users from reality, as well as how to increase students' motivation and engagement, should be addressed.",2022,,Frontiers in Medicine,9,,855403,35433717,,,#9883,Wu 2022,,Scoping or Systematic Review

In this pilot prospective study, carried out between September 2017 and September 2019, we developed a virtual reality (VR) simulation and integrated it into the steps of Gangen's training flow. Next, we analysed objective performance, recorded by the App in the VR system as well as the subjective self-assessments of 96 junior physicians and lab technicians after two practices of VR games. Before receiving training, lab technicians<b>'</b> self-assessed familiarity and confidence regarding proper clinical wastes segregation/disposal were higher than among physicians. Compared with the first VR game, we noted greater improvement in accuracy as well as a higher percentage of shortened time to complete 10 actions of segregation/disposal of VR clinical wastes, among junior physicians/male trainees, that of junior lab technicians/female trainees in the second VR game. Most of the trainees (81%-88%) reported that they found the VR game-based training to be useful, in contrast to poster-mass media-based training.

A Physics-based Virtual Reality Simulation Framework for Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation,"Xiao, X.; Zhao, S.; Meng, Y.; Soghier, L.; Zhang, X.; Hahn, J.","Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a complex procedure. Low intubation success rates for pediatric residents indicate the current training regimen is inadequate for achieving positive patient out-comes. Computer-based training systems in this field have been limited due to the complex nature of simulating in real-time, the anatomical structures, soft tissue deformations and frequent tool interactions with large forces which occur during actual patient intubation. This paper addresses the issues of neonatal ETI training in an attempt to bridge the gap left by traditional training methods. We propose a fully interactive physics-based virtual reality (VR) simulation framework for neonatal ETI that converts the training of this medical procedure to a completely immersive virtual environment where both visual and physical realism were achieved. Our system embeds independent dynamics models and interaction devices in separate modules while allowing them to interact with each other within the same environment, which offers a flexible solution for multi-modal medical simulation scenarios. The virtual model was extracted from CT scans of a neonatal patient, which provides realistic anatomical structures and was parameterized to allow variations in a range of features that affect the level of difficulty. Moreover, with this manikin-free VR system, we can capture and visualize an even larger set of performance parameters in relation to the internal geometric change of the virtual model for real-time guidance and post-trial assessment. Lastly, validation study results from a group of neonatologists are presented demonstrating that VR is a promising platform to train medical professionals effectively for this procedure.",2020,,Proceedings,2020,,557-565,32490403,,,#9899,Xiao 2020,,
Automated Assessment of Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation Measured by a Virtual Reality Simulation System,"Xiao, X.; Zhao, S.; Zhang, X.; Soghier, L.; Hahn, J.","Manual assessment from experts in neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) training is a time-consuming and tedious process. Such subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment method may not only introduce inter-rater/intra-rater variability, but also represent a serious limitation in many large-scale training programs. Moreover, poor visualization during the procedure prevents instructors from observing the events occurring within the manikin or the patient, which introduces an additional source of error into the assessment. In this paper, we propose a physics-based virtual reality (VR) ETI simulation system that captures the entire motions of the laryngoscope and the endotracheal tube (ETT) in relation to the internal anatomy of the virtual patient. Our system provides a complete visualization of the procedure, offering instructors with comprehensive information for accurate assessment. More importantly, an interpretable machine learning algorithm was developed to automatically assess the ETI performance by training on the performance parameters extracted from the motions and the scores rated by experts. Our results show that the leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) classification accuracy of the automated assessment algorithm is 80%, which indicates that our system can reliably conduct a consistent and standardized assessment for ETI training.",2020,,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2020,,2429-2433,33018497,,,#9900,Xiao 2020,,

"Face, content, construct, and concurrent validity of a novel robotic surgery patient-side simulator: the Xperience TM Team Trainer","Xu, S.; Perez, M.; Perrenot, C.; Hubert, N.; Hubert, J.","OBJECTIVES: To determine the face, content, construct, and concurrent validity of the Xperience TM Team Trainer (XTT) as an assessment tool of robotic surgical bed-assistance skills.METHODS: Subjects were recruited during a robotic surgery curriculum. They were divided into three groups: the group RA with robotic bed-assistance experience, the group LS with laparoscopic surgical experience, and the control group without bed-assistance or laparoscopic experience. The subjects first performed two standard FLS exercises on a laparoscopic simulator for the assessment of basic laparoscopic skills. After that, they performed three virtual reality exercises on XTT, and then performed similar exercises on physical models on a da Vinci( R) box trainer.RESULTS: Twenty-eight persons volunteered for and completed the tasks. Most expert subjects agreed on the realism of XTT and the three exercises, and also their interest for teamwork and bed-assistant training. The group RA and the group LS demonstrated a similar level of basic laparoscopic skills. Both groups performed better than the control group on the XTT exercises (p < 0.05). The performance superiority of the group RA over LS was observed but not statistically significant. Correlation of performance was determined between the tests on XTT and on da Vinci( R) box trainer.CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of XTT facilitates the training of bedside assistants and emphasizes the importance of teamwork, which may change the paradigm of robotic surgery training in the near future. As an assessment tool of bed-assistance skills, XTT proves face, content, and concurrent validity. However, these results should be qualified considering the potential limitations of this exploratory study with a relatively small sample size. The training modules remain to be developed, and more complex and discriminative exercises are expected. Other studies will be needed to further determine construct validity in the future.",2016,,Surgical Endoscopy,30,8,3334-44,26659239,,,#9912,Xu 2016,,
Students' perceptions of an in-house developed pharmacy serious game for professional skills training,"Yap, K. Y.; Tan, Sibh; Yap, K. Z.; Yap, J. Y.

[Virtual Reality Skills Training Trends in Nurse Practitioner Education],"Yeh, H. F.","Technology developments change education strategies. Incorporating virtual reality into lesson plans allows education to focus not only on learning knowledge but also on knowledge and skills integration. In simulation education, learning environments are designed to approximate actual clinical situations, allowing students to practice skills in virtual clinical situations continuously. In addition, clinical lecturers may observe the students' practice process and provide feedback. Furthermore, through experiencing and practicing clinical procedures, students gain critical clinical judgment, skills, and teamwork operation competences, which may be applied in the real world. In Taiwan, the majority of nurse practitioner training is implemented in hospitals, and clinical training is done using hands-on and face-to-face teaching strategies within a mentorship framework. Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this hospital-based training model has been significantly challenged. However, this represents an opportunity to migrate the nurse practitioner training model toward technology-based simulation education. Developing more virtual-reality-based lesson plans centered on clinical situations may help students complete training that is normally conducted in hospital teaching environments. Through repetitive practice in virtual reality settings, students may obtain comprehensive knowledge and clinical skills that will help relieve the subsequent stress of clinical practicum work and promote care quality and patient safety.",2021,,Hu Li Tsa Chih - Journal of Nursing,68,5,13-17,34549403,,,#9944,Yeh 2021,,
360degree virtual reality video for the acquisition of knot tying skills: A randomised controlled trial,"Yoganathan, S.; Finch, D. A.; Parkin, E.; Pollard, J.","BACKGROUND: 360degree virtual reality (VR) video is an exciting and evolving field. Current technology promotes a totally immersive, 3-dimensional (3D), 360degree experience anywhere in the world using simply a smart phone and virtual reality headset. The potential for its application in the field of surgical education is enormous. The aim of this study was to determine knot tying skills taught with a 360-degree VR video compared to conventional 2D video teaching.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study. 40 foundation year doctors (first year postgraduate) were randomised to either the 360-degree VR video (n=20) or 2D video teaching (n=20). Participants were given 15min to watch their allocated video. Ability to tie a single handed reef knot was then assessed against a marking criteria developed for the Royal College of Surgeons, England, (RCSeng) Basic Surgical Skills (BSS) course, by a blinded assessor competent in knot tying. Each candidate then underwent further teaching using Peyton's four step model. Knot tying technique was then re-assessed.RESULTS: Knot tying scores were significantly better in the VR video teaching arm when compared with conventional (median knot score 5.0 vs 4.0 p=0.04). When used in combination with face to face skills teaching this difference persisted (median knot score 9.5 vs 9.0 p=0.01). More people in the VR arm constructed a complete reef knot than in the 2D arm following face to face teaching (17/20 vs 12/20). No difference between the groups existed in the time taken to construct a reef knot following video and teaching (median time 31.0s vs 30.5s p=0.89).CONCLUSION: This study shows there is significant merit in the application of 360-degree VR video technology in surgical training, both as an independent teaching aid and when used as an adjunct to traditional face to face teaching.",2018,,International Journal of Surgery,54,Pt A,24-27,29649669,,,#9961,Yoganathan 2018,,

Opportunities for medical students to assess patients at the bedside or through traditional simulation-based medical education have decreased because of coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions. Virtual reality (VR) delivered remotely via video teleconferencing may address this educational gap.METHODS: A prospective pilot study targeting third-year pediatric clerkship students at a large academic children's hospital was conducted from April to December 2020. Groups of 6 to 15 students participated in a 1.5-hour video teleconferencing session with a physician facilitator donning a VR headset and screen sharing interactive VR cases of a hospitalized infant with respiratory distress. Students completed surveys assessing the immersion and tolerability of the virtual experience and reported its perceived effectiveness to traditional educational modalities. Comparisons were analyzed with binomial testing.RESULTS: Participants included third-year medical students on their pediatric clerkship. A total of 140 students participated in the sessions, with 63% completing the survey. A majority of students reported VR captured their attention (78%) with minimal side effects. Students reported remote VR training as more effective (P < .001) than reading and online learning and equally or more effective (P < .001) than didactic teaching.

Effectiveness and Utility of Virtual Reality Infection Control Simulation for Children With COVID-19: Quasi-Experimental Study,"Yu, M.; Yang, M. R.","BACKGROUND: It is essential that nurses quickly learn the proper methods for preventing and controlling nosocomial infection and managing intensive care patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE). Virtual reality (VR) simulation offers the advantage of learning in a safe environment with a sense of realism similar to that of an actual clinical setting and has been reported to enhance self-efficacy in infection control, safety performance, and learning satisfaction among students.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a virtual reality infection control simulation (VRICS) program regarding donning and doffing of PPE and respiratory care for pediatric patients admitted to an isolation unit for COVID-19 and to identify the effects of the program on PPE knowledge, infection control performance, and self-efficacy for nursing students. Additionally, the realism of the VRICS program and the students' level of satisfaction with the program were assessed.METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study based on a controlled pretest-posttest design. Third- and fourth-year nursing students were divided into an experimental group (n=25) who participated in a VRICS program and a control group (n=25) with no participation. Data were collected from November 13 to December 10, 2021, and analyzed using descriptive statistics and the t test, paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test. The VRICS program consisted of a prebriefing, including direct practice of donning and doffing PPE, VR simulation, and debriefing. The VR simulation comprised 3 sessions: donning and inspection of PPE in the dressing room before entering the negative-pressure isolation unit; assessing for suction care, nasopharyngeal suctioning, and checking of COVID-19 patients in the negative-pressure isolation unit; and doffing PPE in the dressing room. The total execution time for the program was 180 min.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the experimental group showed significantly greater improvements in PPE knowledge (z=-3.28, P<.001), infection control performance (t<sub>48</sub>=4.89, P<.001), and self-efficacy (t<sub>36.2</sub>=4.93, P<.001). The experimental group's mean scores for realistic immersion and learner satisfaction were 4.49 (SD 0.50) points and 4.75 (SD 0.38) points (on a 5-point Likert scale), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The VR simulation training program involving pediatric COVID-19 patients combined skills training effectively and enhanced theoretical knowledge, respiratory care skills, and infectious disease preparedness.

Augmented reality (AR) represents a potential adjunct to address this gap.METHODS: A prospective, observational pilot of interprofessional simulation assessing a decompensating patient was conducted from April to June 2019. Teams completed 2 simulations: (1) traditional training (TT) using a manikin (Laerdal SimJunior) and (2) AR-enhanced training (ART) using a manikin plus an AR patient. The primary outcome was self-assessed effectiveness at the assessment of patient decompensation. Secondary outcomes were attitudes toward and adverse effects during the AR training.RESULTS: Twenty-one simulation sessions included 84 participants in headsets. Participants reported improved ability to assess the patient's mental status, respiratory status, and perfusion status (all P < 0.0001) during ART in comparison to TT. Similar findings were noted for recognition of hypoxemia, shock, apnea, and decompensation (all P <= 0.0003) but not for recognition of cardiac arrest (P = 0.06). Most participants agreed or strongly agreed that ART accurately depicted a decompensating patient (89%), reinforced key components of the patient assessment (88%), and will impact how they care for patients (68%). Augmented reality-enhanced training was rated more effective than manikin training and standardized patients and equally as effective as bedside teaching.CONCLUSIONS: This novel application of AR to enhance the realism of manikin simulation demonstrated improvement in self-assessed recognition of patient decompensation.

Video recordings were rated by 2 pair of physician reviewers blinded to student identity. One pair provided a consensus global assessment of performance (not competent, borderline, or competent) while the other used a checklist of observable behaviors to rate performance. Binary discriminant analysis was used to identify the observable behaviors that predicted the global assessment rating.RESULTS: Twenty-six fourth year medical students participated. Student performance of 8 observable behaviors was found to be most predictive of a rating of competent, with a 91% probability. Correctly stating that the patient required an escalation of care had the largest contribution toward predicting a rating of competent, followed by commenting on the patient's increased heart rate, low oxygen saturation, increased respiratory rate, and stating that the patient was in respiratory distress.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that VR can be used to establish objective and observable performance standards for assessment of EPA attainment - a key step in moving towards competency based medical education.",2021,,Academic Pediatrics,21,3,575-579,33091608,,,#9990,Zackoff 2021,,

Evaluation of Augmented Reality Feedback in Surgical Training Environment,"Zahiri, M.; Nelson, C. A.; Oleynikov, D.; Siu, K. C.","Providing computer-based laparoscopic surgical training has several advantages that enhance the training process. Self-evaluation and real-time performance feedback are 2 of these advantages, which avoid dependency of trainees on expert feedback. The goal of this study was to investigate the use of a visual time indicator as real-time feedback correlated with the laparoscopic surgical training. Twenty novices participated in this study working with (and without) different presentations of time indicators. They performed a standard peg transfer task, and their completion times and muscle activity were recorded and compared. Also of interest was whether the use of this type of feedback induced any side effect in terms of motivation or muscle fatigue.RESULTS: Of the 20 participants, 15 (75%) preferred using a time indicator in the training process rather than having no feedback. However, time to task completion showed no significant difference in performance with the time indicator; furthermore, no significant differences in muscle activity or muscle fatigue were detected with/without time feedback.CONCLUSION: The absence of significant difference between task performance with/without time feedback shows that using visual real-time feedback can be included in surgical training based on user preference. Trainees may benefit from this type of feedback in the form of increased motivation. The extent to which this can influence training frequency leading to performance improvement is a question for further study.",2018,,Surgical Innovation,25,1,81-87,29115184,,,#9997,Zahiri 2018,,
Virtual Reality as a Learning Tool for Trainees in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Zaid, M. B.; Dilallo, M.; Shau, D.; Ward, D. T.; Barry, J. J.","INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of virtual reality (VR) as a teaching augment for arthroplasty has not been well examined for unfamiliar multistep procedures such as unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). This study sought to determine whether VR improves surgical competence over traditional procedural preparation when performing a UKA.METHODS: Twenty-two orthopaedic surgery trainees were randomized to two surgical preparation cohorts: (1) ""Guide"" group (control) with access to manufacture's technique guide and surgical video and (2) ""VR"" group with access to an immersive commercially available VR learning module. Surgical performance of UKA on a SawBone model was assessed through time and the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) validated rating system.RESULTS: Participants were equally distributed among all training levels and previous exposure to UKA. No difference in mean surgical times was observed between Guide and VR groups (Guide = 42.4 minutes versus VR = 43.0 minutes; P = 0.9) or mean total OSATS (Guide = 15.7 versus VR = 14.2; P = 0.59). Most trainees felt VR would be a useful tool for resident education (77%) and would use VR for case preparation if available (86.4%).CONCLUSION: In a randomized controlled trial of trainees at a single, large academic center performing a complex, multistep, unfamiliar procedure (UKA), VR training demonstrated equivalent surgical competence compared with the use of traditional technique guides, as measured by surgical time and OSATS scores. Most of the trainees found the VR technology beneficial. This study suggests that VR technology may be considered as an adjunct to traditional surgical preparation/training methods.",2022,,Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,30,2,84-90,34520419,,,#9998,Zaid 2022,,
Virtual Reality for Pediatric Sedation: A Randomized Controlled Trial Using Simulation,"Zaveri, P. P.; Davis, A. B.; O'Connell, K. J.; Willner, E.; Aronson Schinasi, D. A.; Ottolini, M.","INTRODUCTION: Team training for procedural sedation for pediatric residents has traditionally consisted of didactic presentations and simulated scenarios using high-fidelity mannequins. We assessed the effectiveness of a virtual reality module in teaching preparation for and management of sedation for procedures.METHODS: After developing a virtual reality environment in Second Life R (Linden Lab, San Francisco, CA) where providers perform and recover patients from procedural sedation, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of the virtual reality module versus a traditional web-based educational module. A 20 question pre- and post-test was administered to assess knowledge change. All subjects participated in a simulated pediatric procedural sedation scenario that was video recorded for review and assessed using a 32-point checklist. A brief survey elicited feedback on the virtual reality module and the simulation scenario.RESULTS: The median score on the assessment checklist was 75% for the intervention group and 70% for the control group (P = 0.32). For the knowledge tests, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P = 0.14). Users had excellent reviews of the virtual reality module and reported that the module added to their education.CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric residents performed similarly in simulation and on a knowledge test after a virtual reality module compared with a traditional web-based module on procedural sedation. Although users enjoyed the virtual reality experience, these results question the value virtual reality adds in improving the performance of trainees. Further inquiry is needed into how virtual reality provides true value in simulation-based education.",2016,,Cureus,8,2,e486,27014520,,,#10010,Zaveri 2016,,
Virtual versus jaw simulation in Oral implant education: a randomized controlled trial,"Zhang, B.; Li, S.; Gao, S.; Hou, M.; Chen, H.; He, L.; Li, Y.; Guo, Y.; Wang, E.; Cao, R.; Cheng, J.; Li, R.; Zhang, K.","BACKGROUND: This research aims to investigate the evaluation methods of teaching oral implant clinical courses and estimate the effectiveness of a virtual simulation platform.METHODS: Eighty second- and third-year undergraduates in Lanzhou University were recruited and randomized to either three experimental groups or one control group. The subjects undertook theoretical examinations to test their basic level of knowledge after training in similarly unified knowledge courses. Each student group then participated in an eight-hour operating training session. An operation test on pig mandible was conducted, followed by a second theoretical examination. The assessment consists of three distinct parts: a subjective operating score by a clinical senior teacher, an implant accuracy analysis in cone-beam computed tomography (angular, apical, and entrance deviation), and comparison of the two theoretical examinations. Finally, students completed a questionnaire gauging their understanding of the virtual simulation.RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the four groups in first theoretical examination (P > 0.05); the second theoretical scores of the V-J and J-V group (62.90 +/- 3.70, 60.05 +/- 2.73) were significantly higher than the first time (57.05 +/- 3.92, P < 0.05), while no difference between the V (57.10 +/- 3.66) and J (56.89 +/- 2.67) groups was found. Thus, the combination of V-J was effective in improving students' theoretical scores. The V-J and J-V groups had higher scores on operation (73.98 +/- 4.58, 71.85 +/- 4.67) and showed better implant precision.CONCLUSION: Virtual simulation education, especially with a jaw simulation model, could improve students' implantology achievements and training.

Effect of virtual reality simulation training on the response capability of public health emergency reserve nurses in China: a quasiexperimental study,"Zhang, D.; Liao, H.; Jia, Y.; Yang, W.; He, P.; Wang, D.; Chen, Y.; Yang, W.; Zhang, Y. P.","OBJECTIVE: To develop a virtual reality simulation training programme, and further verify the effect of the programme on improving the response capacity of emergency reserve nurses confronting public health emergencies.DESIGN: A prospective quasiexperimental design with a control group.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 120 nurses were recruited and randomly divided into the control group and the intervention group.INTERVENTION: Participants underwent a 3-month training. The control group received the conventional training of emergency response (eg, theoretical lectures, technical skills and psychological training), while the intervention group underwent the virtual reality simulation training in combination with skills training. The COVID-19 cases were incorporated into the intervention group training, and the psychological training was identical to both groups. At the end of the training, each group conducted emergency drills twice. Before and after the intervention, the two groups were assessed for the knowledge and technical skills regarding responses to fulminate respiratory infectious diseases, as well as the capacity of emergency care. Furthermore, their pandemic preparedness was assessed with a disaster preparedness questionnaire.RESULTS: After the intervention, the scores of the relevant knowledge, the capacity of emergency care and disaster preparedness in the intervention group significantly increased (p<0.01). The score of technical skills in the control group increased more significantly than that of the intervention group (p<0.01). No significant difference was identified in the scores of postdisaster management in two groups (p>0.05).CONCLUSION: The virtual reality simulation training in combination with technical skills training can improve the response capacity of emergency reserve nurses as compared with the conventional training.

Effectiveness of virtual simulation and jaw model for undergraduate periodontal teaching,"Zhang, J.; Xing, J.; Zheng, M.; Sheng, J.; Zhang, K.; Zhang, B.","BACKGROUND: The current study explored the effect of virtual simulation and jaw model on development of preclinical periodontal skills in undergraduate students. The study also sought to explore effectiveness of VR in periodontal preclinical training and determine adequate performance mode in basic periodontal education to improve future preclinical training strategies.METHODS: Sixty volunteer sophomores and juniors from the stomatology department in Lanzhou university were enrolled to the current study. Participants were randomly assigned into four groups (each group, n = 15) including the traditional jaw model group (Group J) which was the control group, virtual reality group (Group V), virtual-jaw group (Group V-J), and jaw-virtual group (Group J-V). Participants received training on uniform basic periodontal knowledge before completing the first theoretical assessment. Participants further underwent a total 8 h of operation training and completed a second theoretical assessment. Performance of participants was evaluated using the supragingival scaling processes, and clinical operation scores were graded by a blinded professional using an established standard scoring system.RESULTS: The findings showed no significant difference in the first theoretical outcomes between the four groups (P > 0.05). The scores of the second theoretical assessment were significantly improved for the V-J and J-V groups (60.00 +/- 4.47, 58.33 +/- 4.35) compared with the scores of the first theoretical exam (49.67 +/- 4.81, 48.00 +/- 4.93, P < 0.05). The operation process scores of students in Group V-J and J-V (72.00 +/- 5.92; 70.00 +/- 3.05) were significantly higher compared with the scores in the other two groups (V: 61.67 +/- 7.85; J: 60.67 +/- 2.58).

An Intelligent Augmented Reality Training Framework for Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation,"Zhao, S.; Xiao, X.; Wang, Q.; Zhang, X.; Li, W.; Soghier, L.; Hahn, J.","Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation (ETI) is a critical resuscitation skill that requires tremendous practice of trainees before clinical exposure. However, current manikin-based training regimen is ineffective in providing satisfactory real-time procedural guidance for accurate assessment due to the lack of see-through visualization within the manikin. The training efficiency is further reduced by the limited availability of expert instructors, which inevitably results in a long learning curve for trainees. To this end, we propose an intelligent Augmented Reality (AR) training framework that provides trainees with a complete visualization of the ETI procedure for real-time guidance and assessment. Specifically, the proposed framework is capable of capturing the motions of the laryngoscope and the manikin and offer 3D see-through visualization rendered to the head-mounted display (HMD). Furthermore, an attention-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is developed to automatically assess the ETI performance from the captured motions as well as identify regions of motions that significantly contribute to the performance evaluation. Lastly, augmented user-friendly feedback is delivered with interpretable results with the ETI scoring rubric through the color-coded motion trajectory that classifies highlighted regions that need more practice. The classification accuracy of our machine learning model is 84.6%.",2020,,International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality : (ISMAR) [proceedings],2020,,672-681,33935605,,,#10057,Zhao 2020,,
[Preliminary evaluation of a virtual reality dental simulation system on training of caries identification ability],"Zhao, S. M.; Zhao, X. H.; Zhang, J.; Wang, D. X.; Wang, X. Y.","OBJECTIVE: To develop a software based on ""UniDental"" system which is a virtual reality dental simulation system and applied to undergraduate majoring in stomatology to improve the ability of identifying caries.METHODS: A software was developed applying to identify virtual dental caries based on UniDental system. In the software, a virtual dental caries model was designed and carious tissue was separated to 3 layers by the depth. The stiffness was the same within each layer which was increasing gradually layer by layer. The roughness was also the same within each layer which was decreasing gradually layer by layer. Sixty-four participants in pre-clinical stage of the class of 2014 majoring in stomatology from Peking University School of Stomatology were trained with the software. During the training, the students should probe on the virtual dental carious tissue layer by layer and feel the difference of vertical stiffness and horizontal roughness of each layer by using a handpiece with realistic force feedback. After training, a questionnaire survey was conducted to evaluate the software including a score of 1-5 for haptic fidelity of stiffness and roughness and their relevant gradient and benefit of improving the ability of identifying caries, choosing the preferred training method. The data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTS: The median of subjective evaluation scores of the proposed metrics were all ""4"", demonstrating that the software operated above medium fidelity. The stiffness scores of all 3 layers were statistically significant (P < 0.05) on the stiffness gradient score. The roughness scores of the 1st and 2nd layers were statistically significant (P < 0.05) on the roughness gradient score. The training was helpful to improve the ability of identifying caries (median was 4). The scores of all 3 layers stiffness and relevant gradient were statistically significant (P < 0.05) on the score of benefit of improving the ability of identifying caries. 90.4% of the participants preferred the traditional extracted teeth training method.CONCLUSION: The virtual reality dental simulation system was helpful to improve students' ability of identifying caries. It couldn't replace the traditional extracted teeth training method by now, it should be used as a supplement to the traditional training method.",2020,,Beijing da Xue Xue Bao.

Efficacy of virtual reality techniques in cardiopulmonary resuscitation training: protocol for a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and trial sequential analysis,"Zheng, J.; Du, L.; Deng, X.; Zhang, L.; Wang, J.; Chen, G.","INTRODUCTION: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the most critical procedure in the rescue of patients with sudden cardiac death (SCD). The success rate of CPR remains far below expectations, which made CPR education identified as the top priority for SCD. CPR training using the virtual reality (VR) technique is a feasible training method, with a wider population and lower cost, but its efficacy remains controversial. Thus, we will perform a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the efficacy of the VR technique on CPR quality.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese BioMedical Literature, Wanfang and VIP databases from inception to November 2021, to identify randomised controlled trials and the first period in randomised cross-over trials assessing the efficacy of VR techniques versus non-VR techniques for adult participants accepting adult CPR training. No language restrictions will be considered. Data synthesis will be performed using RevMan V.5.4 and Stata/MP V.16.0. Outcome measures will be present as relative risk with 95% CIs for dichotomous data and mean difference with 95% CIs for continuous data. The primary outcome will be the CPR quality defined as chest compression rate and depth. Secondary outcomes will be the overall performance of CPR. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the chi<sup>2</sup> test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic. Data will be synthesised by either fixed-effects or random-effects models according to the I<sup>2</sup> value. Trial sequential analysis and modified Jadad Scale will be used to control the risks of random errors and evaluate the evidence quality. Egger's regression test and funnel plots will be used to assess the publication bias.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was not required for this systematic review protocol.

Thirty physicians were divided into 2 groups. The virtual reality dental implant training system was used for group A, while conventional theoretical knowledge training and clinical demonstration were performed in group B. All young physicians have a 1-month study. After training, all the physicians in groups A and B would conduct a questionnaire survey according to the training situation, which was compared between the 2 groups. The success rate of the operation was also evaluated and compared. The median scores in the 5 dimensions of postoperative assessment of group A was 9/9/9/8/8, and of group B was 6/7/6/7/7. The scores of the 5 dimensions were significantly higher than those of group B (P < .05), indicating that group A has a better grasp of the simulator. After the training of simulated mandibular implants in group A, the deviations in the 4 dimensions of mesiodistal, buccal and tongue, depth, and angle were significantly lower than those of group B (P < .05). Group A has smaller deviations in each of the 4 dimensions than those in group B, indicating group A has a higher operation success rate.

This paper first shows the learning environment and platform of the VR/AR system, then explains the interface and operation of the system, and evaluates the teaching situation. This paper takes the VR/AR operation simulation system of an Irish company as an example and evaluates the learning effect of 41 students in our hospital. Research shows that the introduction of the feature reweighting module in the VR/AR surgery simulation system improves the accuracy of bone structure segmentation (IOU value increases from 79.62% to 83.56%). For real human ultrasound image data, the IOU value increases from 80.21% to 82.23% after the feature reweighting module is introduced. Therefore, the dense convolution module and feature reweighting module improve the learning ability of the network for bone structure features in ultrasound images from two aspects of feature connection and importance understanding and effectively improve the performance of bone structure segmentation.",2021,,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,2021,,9998427,34211684,,,#10071,Zhou 2021,,

Influence of practical and clinical experience on dexterity performance measured using haptic virtual reality simulator,"Ziane-Casenave, S.; Mauroux, M.; Devillard, R.; Kerouredan, O.","INTRODUCTION: Development of dexterity, hand-eye coordination and self-assessment are essential during the preclinical training of dental students. To meet this requirement, dental simulators have been developed combining virtual reality with a force feedback haptic interface. The aim of this study was to assess the capability of the VirTeaSy<sup>©</sup> haptic simulator to discriminate between users with different levels of practical and clinical experience.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six volunteers divided into five groups (non-dentists, 1st/3rd/final-year dental students, recent graduates) had three attempts to prepare an occlusal amalgam cavity using the simulator. Percentages of volumes prepared inside (%IV) and outside (%OV) the required cavity, skill index and progression rate, referring to the evolution of skill index between trials 1 and 3, were assessed. The dental students and recent graduates completed a questionnaire to gather their opinions about their first hands-on experience with a haptic simulator.RESULTS: The results showed no significant difference between the groups at the first attempt. Following the third attempt, the skill index was improved significantly. Analysis of progression rates, characterised by large standard deviations, did not reveal significant differences between groups. The third attempt showed significant differences in skill index and %IV between 1st-year undergraduate dental students and both non-dentists and recent dental graduates. The questionnaire indicated a tendency for dental operators to consider the simulator as a complement to their learning and not a substitute for traditional methods.CONCLUSION: This study did not show the ability of a basic aptitude test on VirTeaSy<sup>©</sup> haptic simulator to discriminate between users of different levels of expertise.

Shortage of training can negatively affect dental implantologists' performance during intraoperative procedures, resulting in lack of surgical precision and, consequently, inadequate implant placement, which may lead to unsuccessful implant supported restorations or other complications.OBJECTIVE: We designed and developed IMMPLANT a virtual reality educational tool to assist implant placement learning, which allows users to freely manipulate 3D dental models (e.g., a simulated patient's mandible and implant) with their dominant hand while operating a touchscreen device to assist 3D manipulation.METHODS: The proposed virtual reality tool combines an immersive head-mounted display, a small hand tracking device and a smartphone that are all connected to a laptop. The operator's dominant hand is tracked to quickly and coarsely manipulate either the 3D dental model or the virtual implant, while the non-dominant hand holds a smartphone converted into a controller to assist button activation and a greater input precision for 3D implant positioning and inclination. We evaluated IMMPLANT's usability and acceptance during training sessions with 16 dental professionals.RESULTS: The conducted user acceptance study revealed that IMMPLANT constitutes a versatile, portable, and complementary tool to assist implant placement learning, as it promotes immersive visualization and spatial manipulation of 3D dental anatomy.CONCLUSIONS: IMMPLANT is a promising virtual reality tool to assist student learning and 3D dental visualization for implant placement education.
