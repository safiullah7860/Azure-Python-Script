You are going to review an abstract of an article. Based on the following criteria, you will answer "yes" or "no" and give reasons to each of your responses. 
PLEASE NOTE: this is based on human answers, and they all answered yes for each criteria, so we assume the answer will be yes for each criteria as well. 
But we want to see what your response is to each criteria.
Here are the criteria for answering "yes" or "no" for each row (which has the title and abstract):
(Criteria 1): The abstract needs to have at least one of the following populations:
-Nurses
-Midwives
-Advance practice providers.
-Surgeons
-Mental health care providers
-Emergency care providers
-Lifestyle/nutrition providers
-Dentists
-Physicians
-Pharmacists
-Doctors
-Physical Therapists
-Occupational Therapists
-Speech Therapists
-Students of any of the above.

(Criteria 2): The abstract needs to be related to one of the following interventions:
-VR-based simulation training
-AR & MR based simulation training
-SBS screen-based simulation training
-3D imagery for medical education
-telementoring or multiuser XR, as long as you are simulating something.

(Criteria 3): The abstract needs to have one of the following outcomes:
-Quantitative data (on XR usage for medical training) reported and analyzed.
-Qualitative observations by recognized experts.  But must be data.
-Must be data about a learning experience using XR or SBS media.
XR for evaluating proficiency.

(Criteria 4): The abstract needs to exclude (ALL) of the following topics (i.e if one of the following topics is in the abstract, it is not considered):
-XR for treatment
-XR for anything non-medical
-3D model images only and not used in education

Make sure the output includes a reason why each criteria has the result. Here's the title of the article as well as the abstract: 
THE FIRST LINE OF THE RESPONSE HAS TO BE AN OVERALL "YES" or "NO"!
THE FIRST LINE OF EACH CRITERIA REASON should have a "YES" or "NO" along with an explanation
You have to put a yes or no, do not put "not specified"

NO

Reason:
Criteria 1: YES The abstract does mention any of the populations listed in the criteria.
Criteria 2: YES The abstract does mention any of the interventions listed in the criteria.
Criteria 3: YES The abstract does provide any data or observations about XR usage for medical training.
